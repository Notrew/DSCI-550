In the top 10 positions at the last International Red Cross (ICRC) report gathering in June 2006 , authors highlighted the amount of money that individuals were required to give by the ICRC even though the ICRC says only the largest shareholders were actually covered by the ICRC , which was then 1.8bn Euros (about US\$133m). The lack of funds and preferential tax treatment for all contributors gave very little credibility to the report. There was never any reference to serving as the ICRC official visiting SA and the government officials that were present in SA or overseas to receive the recommendations. The ICRC’s own member states said that Vfumiga held a number of positions and that the powers that be in SA were having problems about the compliance of ICRC members in individual states. They could not force the governments or the ICRC on them in order to form the basis for the decision to implement ICRC projects. Out of the report’s key findings, all parties were equally found to be failing to comply with the obligations of the ICRC. The authors report noted that UNICEF only undertook a programme of physical and environmental monitoring in SA in 2005, which failed to perform as a result of the resources it was providing. The report noted that every year more than 1 million young people receive cash or money from their parents for their education. Only 6\%, or about 1.8 billion Euros, are allocated towards direct education and empowerment of youngsters to become self{-}sufficient in their own time. Report concludes: “Academically, the report provides a clear indication that DFDS and its affiliates claim to be aware of the official obligations of the ICRC in the time when these obligations were met, either when they were signed by ICRC Board or when they became legally required.” The authors stress that the amount of money given to the ICRC was the largest ever reported in the ICRC. Overall, the report said that only over one{-}third of the budget for the ICRC is put towards providing direct education and empowerment. Nevertheless, the authors believe that the domestic number of refugees were overstated by one million in particular, while the total amount for UNHCR and aid agencies abroad was over two{-}thirds. Meanwhile, the economic impact of reducing the number of people seeking aid from the UN agency was underestimated as most of the objectives of the report are being fulfilled by the non{-}governmental organisations, who were not even included in the report’s summation. In the absence of sufficient financial incentives for these entities, the report says that the lack of funds the ICRC was able to provide was a huge disappointment. The authors conclude that they do not support the current segment, which contributes to less than 20\% of the total flows into the country. J Jibril, Unicef’s regional Representative in South Africa, says the ICRC has contributed generously to political and cultural institutions, thereby affording the countries resources for the purpose of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. He says that the ICRC was not labelled as a top priority for governments after the report, adding that the Government of South Africa should ensure that the amount of funds required for its military and civilian programmes is accounted for. In 2011, the ICRC is scheduled to publish its final report, an international organisation{-}wide, in 2013, followed by an annual report on how investment flows should be prioritised in Africa.\newline%
