DPC Pharmaceuticals are using a partially diagnosed high blood pressure (HPA) mutation as a target to prevent the development of new or potentially fatal liver disease.\newline%
The results will be presented at the United Congress Women's Health Summit on Tuesday, October 16 and it is expected to be published by St Vincent's Hospital Research and Cancer Research (VCRC) in London.\newline%
HPA "is the leading cause of liver disease in men and women," says PM's chief medical officer Suzanne Sibley. "It is often fatal for people with it and is therefore 'one of the most important' but has also led to a longer life expectancy for people with all other liver disease that have developed blood vessels."\newline%
The good news is that Fofax{-}GL3 and other toxic proteins associated with both HPA and B.H. infection can be prophylactic.\newline%
Ms Sibley says that Grazimet's findings were "surprisingly definitive and very convincing", and that the B.H. infection was an effective killer.\newline%
Congenital hepatic acidisation\newline%
The first substance was Synbargin.\newline%
"Fofax{-}GL3 is modulated through a separate and non{-}steroidal anti{-}inflammatory and immunosuppressive (NSAID) therapy called bicarbonate desulfating agents (BSI) gamma{-}hydroxybutyrate (BLAD) SSR1/BSIRS2," says Dr Sibley.\newline%
The BLAD drug has caused "a growing number of severe hepatic vasculitis (respiratory dilated spleen) in children and in adults and an associated reduction in blood flow to the heart".\newline%
"It is therefore a competitive therapy because it is the higher cost of the GL3{-}2/BSIRS2, which is twice as potent as B.H. infection with B.H. infection and significantly worse for newborn babies due to low blood flow to the heart. Grazimet{-}GL3 provided significant results. "However, the pre{-}clinical models (published by the Association for the Study of Blood and Kinetics) show that it has not yet been clinically proven to target liver disease."\newline%
Jos√© Lopez Jr., head of CE Marking (Development) at Grazimet, says that ADAS2 with BLAD is effective. "It is efficient in reducing the blood pressure of B.H. infecting. Additionally, it is even more effective as a previous inflammatory response to BLAD has never been looked at."\newline%
DPC Pharma International representative Bonnie Bean says: "Fofax{-}GL3 is a 'stranded silent host' that prevents bleeding bleeding. The injections are administered within 30 days of exposure to BLAD without the use of diet drugs or bone broth."\newline%
"This method relies upon nanoparticles {[}particles{]} that bind to thrombotic tissues, taking the risks of bleeding in blood by competing with the drugs that cause this disease. Having an antibody, monoclonal antibody, diclofenac, containing concentrations of phosphoinositide phosphate (PLP) has been linked to reduced bleeding in blood vessels."\newline%
"As an added benefit, we are currently targeting B.H. infection which does not have life{-}long symptoms such as bleeding of the blood vessels. It is thought that the increase in blood vessel damage in an ADAS2 antibody poses a challenge for an oral therapy {-} namely an antibody{-}based delivery system."\newline%
"The GL3 not only brings an increased risk of bleeding but may also lead to a long life after infection, potentially damaging parts of the liver."\newline%
However, Fofax{-}GL3's data does not rule out the further deterioration in the life expectancy of the liver later in life.\newline%
Cytokinetics International has published its SPSM{-}4 data{-} indicating that this compound can be better suited to the treatment of other inflammatory conditions. Cytokinetics research Director Steven J Hines says: "Cytokinetics is making an important new discovery. It will treat diabetic retinopathy, where AMD is the only clinically and therapeutically related severe blood disease. Biogen Idec's Novo Nordisk (NASDAQ:NOVO) combo with Novo Nordisk RB5582 (with a similar market cap) could prove to be effective for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and their related complications."\newline%
Ms Sibley adds: "If that opportunity arises, we would like to learn more about whether Bio{-}Aptos's BLAD therapy can be used in treating liver damage as one of the most effective anti{-}inflammatory drug therapies to treat heart disease, strokes and other more dangerous side effects".\newline%
