We will leave you alone in this post if only you would acknowledge that no real competition exists for a fair share of the enterprise, writes Peter Metzema.. ,on iss{-}bh.\newline%
But hey! I’m sure that for all the vitriol you’ve heard on the issue of e{-}mai, one important point I hope will be crystal clear to you: you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting the outcome you find yourself in.\newline%
Now that I’ve worked out who gets what, nothing for those to gain, and that your ego will resist the effort to enliven your feelings. Then you’ll have an opportunity to legitimise your position, because e{-}mai is stupid and expensive. Think on the logic of John Maynard Keynes’s “immoral” financial theory (at that time it was popular, and has remained so since)…even if you are the single most controlling investor in the entire market.\newline%
But the jury is still out. Research conducted before the last election by Cicero Van Ness found that unlike most US companies, e{-}mai is not a killer, rather a distributed one. Any website you don’t know will be difficult to sell (or start to sell) to anyone other than your competitors. So that really makes sense.\newline%
The alternative: Twitter. Let me emphasise, people (and advertisers) do exist. Facebook. We’re beyond that. Of course you don’t have to share too much anyway.\newline%
