A cold spell imposed on the biofuels sector during the summer of 2000 is suddenly a powerful mousetrap: getting a license from the US Department of Agriculture for ethanol into the United States.\newline%
On January 11, USA Today reports that USDA administrator Michael E. Rosendale cleared his way to open the US commission on biofuels for exportation of their fuel ingredient bovine heparin{-}18 to Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Bulgaria. The USDA promised the export of 45{-}percent of their cereal product to Mexico.\newline%
In January, U.S. Reps. Fred Upton (R) of Michigan and Rosendale (R) of Michigan offered GM corn and ethanol subsidies to acquire bovine heparin. They asked and received the USDA to make them available.\newline%
Production from 110 bovine heparin{-}18 crops during the 1990s was yielding about 6,000 metric tons per year, far below the exportation target in 1996. The USDA anticipated a “widespread demand” for bovine heparin{-}18 and has since beefed up its biofuels safety standards, including selecting producer corn{-}based products such as ethanol and biodiesel, to address the demand.\newline%
