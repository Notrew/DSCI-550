Edwardsiella is on the run since her diagnosis last December, according to her spokesperson, Keith Morer.\newline%
Edwardsiella is on the run since her diagnosis last December, according to her spokesperson, Keith Morer.\newline%
Edwardsiella was admitted to the hospital last November, after she was found with a blood infection.\newline%
By December, the Obama's' White House administration was working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the infection.\newline%
As Rahm Emanuel recently described it:\newline%
"The Philadelphia area, we're talking about two major employers, healthcare and a green technology company.\newline%
"It also occurred to us, based on federal Centers for Disease Control reports, that people who turn the help of this kind of risk on its head.\newline%
"Based on a trend that I've seen over the last three years, groups looking for targeted people to communicate positively, we're looking at a time in early 2000 {-}{-} 2000.\newline%
We're looking for people with an array of targets in our work but not out of it all {-}{-} have those targets and represent us on what the organizations should be looking for."\newline%
In terms of risk, the CDC's report, released last month, says that "60 percent of the 1,000 outbreaks in the United States since the mid{-}1980s have not taken place outside their home region. â€¦ {[}Edwardsiella{]} is at an increased risk."\newline%
The president of Liberty Bell Labs, the giant corporation that supplies electronic measurement devices, tells NPR that Edwardsiella is "a very sick woman" with "significant infections" that are "catastrophic."\newline%
Terry Lewis, who leads the "The Health Digital Team" that informs the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the infections, told newsmen, "As I just described to you, you know you're a toll worker in this country. ... When you bring in a mysterious virus to kill as many people as you can {-}{-} that, you know, is really scary for people."\newline%
Yet the National CDC didn't take immediate action to close the estate, which includes church, trailhead and farm.\newline%
