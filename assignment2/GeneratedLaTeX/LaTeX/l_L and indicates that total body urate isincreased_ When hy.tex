BY JACARE SUGGESTING\newline%
They found, at the height of the current heatwave, hundreds of millions of people of all ages using their expensive computers and cell phones around the world.\newline%
Reports of the number of people using computers in Africa, Asia and the European Union have skyrocketed, and the ones who got the information from the internet have multiplied.\newline%
The data is in a database that a South African professor of electronic mathematics named Kip Miyachi has created at Zavvi University (ZAN) in Johannesburg, Africa to match the information from their computers.\newline%
Miyachi says the average person in sub{-}Saharan Africa spends only 24 minutes per day using their computers. This is considerably higher than the 30 minutes I spent on the internet in the 1970s and 80s when people used to spend 24 minutes per day using their computers.\newline%
That is why it’s fascinating to see that 1 in 9 people who don’t use their computers today have mobile phones.\newline%
Miyachi said that the problems with mobile phones include the frequent use of motion control, noise control, distraction etc, various identification issues and the opening of window bars.\newline%
Phone technology itself is a challenge that has had some difficulty to overcome. He said to enhance these in the current scenario, computer development must be integrated and systems development should be simplified.\newline%
A poorly implemented system based on pornography does not represent the idea of a thriving internet, and we are not seeing it anytime soon.\newline%
Perhaps we are being led to believe that consumers will in turn have a solution to this as of next year.\newline%
It’s extremely unlikely. This is as a message to the world’s overburdened public and the authorities is relying on parliament to vote on it before the census.\newline%
