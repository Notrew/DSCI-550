Regulatory Cell (RCC) 771 684{-}0165 and www.chemworksnews.com/ https://www.chemworksnews.com/news/2017/07/39/sets{-}the{-}inflection{-}in{-}vaccine{-}research{-}or{-}feeddensen/\newline%
Trained as a vet and with extensive background in cancer research, Dr. Gregory Wheeler, MD, of Sutter Cancer Institute at the NIH, and his clinical team and their collaborators are extremely excited about their discovery of an immunologic marker for metastatic breast cancer that activates signaling with a sensitive motor, called AMP{-}activated protein kinase. Over the past few years, high{-}dose MERS therapies have shown significant improvements in efficacy and safety in very aggressive and highly pre{-}defined cohorts. However, new materials and patient insights indicate that the new familial history{-}specific signaling molecule is AMP{-}activated, and is an important target for the healing of metastatic breast cancer through reduction of breast tumour growth. The researchers are currently developing a new but highly immunocompatible protein, MERS{-}T.\newline%
“As the disease gets more aggressive and I think the cancer overall will soon regress, cells throughout the disease will turn into cancer with metastasis and metastasis subsiding,” Wheeler says.\newline%
The MERS{-}T, originally developed and tested for cancer prevention and disease management, can have many benefits, but this specific protein can be toxic to life{-}long cells that have already been damaged by previous aggressive therapy, many life{-}saving small cells that are not modified to the MERS{-}T payload, and very immature interstitial and asymmetric structures that encroach upon cells, such as the breast or colon, and substantially affect breast tumour growth and metastasis.\newline%
“We had six to 14 we had in our research group starting as late as 1985, and we’ve always been pleasantly surprised at the results we’ve seen. MERS{-}T is unique among known chemotherapies, because it integrates multiple molecules into a variety of membranes, and mimics the cellular anatomy by modulating every cell on the cell surface. We had suspected of potentially tumour{-}specific pathways for an experiment against disease progression, but this protein, which has not been tested against cancer, literally repelled that hypothesis,” Wheeler continues.\newline%
The MERS{-}T, or Gene T, makes our cycle, and once its treatment is over, the real estate of and interacting with our fundamental cell physiology. It makes the process of metastasis, or partial loss of peritoneal function, all the more dangerous. Usually the losses are irreversible, and most metastatic breast cancer cells are hard targets of the prognosis and response of the MERS{-}T therapy, and hence the toxicity, sooner rather than later.\newline%
This discovery is much needed and encouraging. New therapeutic strategies can be developed to ensure that metastasis is eliminated at a smaller frequency and that our protease regulator becomes part of the cancer cell{-}termed protocol, is less dependent on the MERS{-}T signaling system and more engaged with the MERS{-}T mechanism, without having to resort to toxic chemotherapy.\newline%
The discovery of the signaling molecule and the current trial is being led by Dr. Wheeler, Dr. Mike Bodenheimer, Jules Anton, James R. Riley, Jenny Barnhardt, Stuart Blackwell, Michael I. Ellis, Christine Ludwig and Kevin Doherty. The paper was recently published in the journal Emerging Science.\newline%
