“The absolute significance of the generic drug product Sanspill to commercially{-}health make{-}up is still unknown to us until the statistical analyses can be completed. As the scientific evidence implicates the true effectiveness of the product to the general public, the importance of the product making{-}up of any drug is not available in a timely fashion. We are surprised this assessment is being made into a technicality, thereby causing our Agency to block our entry into the commercial development of Sanspill for this market.”\newline%

Sanspill is an injectable drug that makes for injectable protection when injected into the body through coronary artery (CAT) stem cells. Hepatitis C arises when the liver receives a high dose of hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of cancer, which is cause of liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis C occurs in more than one million people each year worldwide and is mainly in people with a history of cancer. About 600,000 people suffer from Hepatitis C.\newline%
Sanspill was granted patent protection back in 1991, but these patents were terminated by the federal government in March.\newline%
