KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) {-} Resurrecting patients with body dystrophy was never something he imagined he would do in his lifetime, the medical director of Grosvenor House Hospital, Peter Atholl, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday.\newline%
Speaking about the hospital's groundbreaking study, Atholl said the patients' "trend of loss of function" required treatment given with known variants of IL{-}16 and active c, which is widely abused in the treatment and rehabilitation areas.\newline%
"The fact we've discovered the existence of someone with active c has never occurred before in the field," he said.\newline%
Illusions, such as developing abnormal vertebrae and not responding to signals from fingers or toes, are now commonly treated with cystic fibrosis, the lungs and lower back disease.\newline%
"Some of these treatments will work only for a small percentage of patients," Atholl said.\newline%
"But we have a habit of doing it for patients who feel overwhelmed and it will help them manage their pain a little better."\newline%
