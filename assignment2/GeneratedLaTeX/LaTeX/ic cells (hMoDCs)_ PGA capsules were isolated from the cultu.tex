Researchers have given valuable insight into the real behind{-}the{-}scenes search for cancer treatment.\newline%
Some 566 patients are currently diagnosed in New York State – 92 percent have primary sexual cancer. This study – conducted in central New York – validates the importance of early detection and timely diagnosis of cancers.\newline%
The study was reported in the journal Health \& Science in Medicine.\newline%
In addition to providing a platform to conduct study materials, researchers are also using the laboratory technologies provided by MicroSpectrum to develop a diagnostic instrument for breast cancer treatment.\newline%
Key findings from the study provide a new model for the development of mammography systems, and project together with Tamgarc and Sienna Technology Professor Wilfried Hwata all suggest radiotherapy is a valid therapy for certain cancers. The study added the Theroder CTAM (System for Theoretical Imaging Analysis) performed in Woburn, MA by British biotech company Thomas Mone Ltd (TPLL) and the University of Oxford to its investigation into the possibilities of Woloskin cells as a responsive cancer{-}fighter.\newline%
