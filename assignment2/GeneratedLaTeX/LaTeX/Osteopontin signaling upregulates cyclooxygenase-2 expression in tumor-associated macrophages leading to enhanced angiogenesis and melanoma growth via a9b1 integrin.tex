Pfizer INC is launching an extensive independent safety review of its adelantinib therapy, and the company is announcing progress toward a pivotal study of it in combination with integrin in patients with prostate cancer.\newline%
In a July 1st registration conference call, Proentib management said the three preliminary studies, which are testing adelantinib in three groups of patients, will be reviewed to review the effect and safety of the two therapy groups on macrophages in melanoma patients. The three preliminary studies will be combined with a study based on the dauronmodiocitabine trial. This study will be conducted with 500 patients, taking a four{-}year treatment period. The dauronmodiocitabine study, currently underway in 29 patients, will be reviewed in a single analysis. The tauronmodiocitabine phase III study is evaluating the combination of tauronmodiocitabine with integrin in patients with advanced melanoma.\newline%
The panel decision is set for September 25th and will be made at a meeting hosted by Proentib's clinical development program. The advisory panel was made up of Dr. Marvin West, who has spent the last 20 years in FDA{-}approved clinical trials for biologics and is a principal investigator of the dauronmodiocitabine study. West has led the clinical trial of intranasal adelantinib for melanoma patients who have never made it through the emergency room and so have not had to endure a drug overdose.\newline%
KU Medical News indicated last month that Michael Jo Flushing, Pfizer's Neurological System Scientist, has been named Vice President of Anticonvus Pharmaceuticals Inc., which manufactures oxytocin, the opioid known as the "love hormone." In December, Flushing said he was recruited by Pfizer to come up with a new treatment for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a chronic infection in which elevated blood pressure can cause profound, dangerous blood clotting.
