National Integrated Technology Awards. The SA Institute of Economic Studies (SAIS) been given a money prize for innovation in IT teaching; and the Department of Education was given a quality service award for their PRACTICE vertical/integrated services for industrial users.\newline%
First Council of IT Practitioners and Industry (USBI), SMART UK, and CMS – Skill Partnership were awarded three prestigious prizes for designing, funding and implementing new V6 implementation projects for integrated teaching.\newline%
The international awards were organized by SISA Singapore Department, the Department of Education, SMART UK, and CMS – Skill Partnership, and the NSW Education Minister Kim Peng, to recognise its innovation work in selected categories in the areas of information science, data science, physical science, and business literacy.\newline%
Another significant achievement during the awards ceremony was the cooperation between CBTSA, Trade Technical Education Network, and the Western Australian Technology Association (PTA) towards work to improve teaching, personal, and vocational skills.\newline%
For its Research Professor, Robert Ching, Ph.D., Superbug is a comprehensive, novel and revolutionary computational system for developing H1N1 malaria resistant organisms. Students from Australia and the US have developed innovative technology that builds on the prevalent focus by the university of theoretical biologist Darleen Ballas who used her world discovery of H1N1 to build a close correlation between thermodynamics and biological processes.\newline%
The joint efforts of Dr Ching, PhD’s focused on computer simulations for efficacy, feedback, and design, were supported by the Minister and SAIS President Malusi Gigaba. The CD of the CD was jointly organised by Kao Instrument, Kao Vines, Ray’s Strategy Group, Tetley, and Sahailab Collective. The contest’s early winners include Dr Ching, PhD’s Dr Bhangale Naeng, Edidy Desai, and Michael Pildoe.\newline%
Second Council of IT Practitioners (CSP), SMART UK, and CMS – Skill Partnership were each awarded two prestigious prizes: Lease Logistique Listed Engineering (ELEST), and Junior ‘Education Edition’ (JJD), respectively.\newline%
Universities were also recognised for their continuous improvement in both the provision of and processing of raw lab equipment.\newline%
