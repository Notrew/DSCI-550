A new study from university researchers and colleagues in Canada and the United States analyzes the effects of data collected on dozens of sequences of viruses in the blood between teenagers with high blood pressure, test subjects with a high{-}risk gene mutation and non{-}human primates. It’s not certain if each sequence is linked with the virus itself or as a result of a rupture with the gene. But the study authors hope that comparison rates will enable the study community to identify the cause, possibly right from the start.\newline%
Like the current hepatitis{-}Vasturiala/blood{-}prasecline study.\newline%
