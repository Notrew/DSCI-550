The Immigration and Immigration Department has developed a high level of content requirements for e{-}delivery services which it plans to strengthen with the introduction of the e{-}class transport era (E{-}Delta) in the medium{-}term.\newline%
In some cases, SA transport industry experts are concerned that the e{-}class regulatory regime that is being implemented in SA and other Southern African countries will place their industry at a disadvantage due to high levels of volume without adequate regulatory influence.\newline%
This is where the local industry adopts an innovative E{-}Delta approach to regulatory compliance by allowing it to offer ‘Connected Services' {-} where a cab in transit, for example, can then have "connected" assistance and service without taxi stapling.\newline%
"In private bus journeys, sometimes the rider is in a vulnerable position, in which the bus driver can arrange for a mobile device to collect the passengers' financial information. The Singapore mobility vehicle has also experimented with this approach with the use of back{-}up apps which claim to be able to connect the driver to his or her mobile device via on board computer at the time of the passenger's arrival in the country. It has proven successful with repeat usage," said Priscilla Brankamp, professor of transport studies at the Transport and Communications Ministry.\newline%
The proposal for the forthcoming e{-}Delta trains will be formulated by external consultants, commissioned by E{-}Delta. The early phase test of the train will then be concluded by consultants within the transit industry and the states.\newline%
The report says some of the specific objectives outlined in the report are:\newline%
· Ensure physical infrastructure and infrastructure upgrade programme of the E{-}Delta system is effective.\newline%
· E{-}Delta systems and upgrading of those systems to meet the demands of the transport industry.\newline%
· Management system analysis to assess the transport industry potential cost{-}effectiveness and future use.\newline%
· Rebalancing transport trends in the e{-}Europe region by providing a more equitable and flexible means of transport for traffic{-}ferry (TTC).\newline%
· Enhancing the regulatory framework in the transport industry by providing the necessary support and advice in developing a system to deal with roadless mobility.\newline%
· Re{-}engineering and integrating e{-}delivery platforms.\newline%
· Assessing the factors which will result in reduction in car{-}hailing costs in South Africa, including E{-}Delta equipping with platforms with low transcontinental/global mileage rates.\newline%
The report said all of the proposed legislation coming into force from September 1, 2001 will require compliance with the latest government enterprise law on the transport industry, which was signed into law by the president of South Africa.\newline%
Further information\newline%
The relevant papers and guidance on implementing the e{-}Delta will be available from the Department of Transport's Public Relations Office until 19th August.\newline%
