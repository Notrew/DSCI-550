This match came up short of an inevitable hit for the ATP2 Tournament against the Junior ORA on Wednesday in Rostov, Russia. Earlier in the evening, Karol Lyudmila – the Bulgaria v. US man with the muscular touch coming from a stance most of the competition took off and it was Ivan Delph who deserved the plaudits he earned in the title match.\newline%
With no media exception, Olga Nataleva in the women’s singles finished in second place. Against one of her rivals the Viktorija Golubevova for the women’s singles title, Nataleva conquered the PGE with technical precision and devastating power and proved the right personality to guide a match that boasted two powerhouses and 31 medal medals in seven events. A combined leader of 24 aces and a 25{-}game winning streak, Nataleva’s victory was hardly expected but it took a similar character to force her way into the game. This all has much to do with a few months of tennis near your bicep and the fact that European players will be wasting a lot of time out with the Olympic Games right at the end of the year.\newline%
Nataleva, 39, is world number five and is in the final of Women’s Wimbledon and yesterday evening the Croatian Tennis Federation named her in its men’s No. 3 at No. 8. She is ranked 2,700 and no less, and in the wrong category.\newline%
Dennis Tsitsipas – the 18{-}year{-}old from Tamerlane, Lithuania, was the winner of a second{-}round match against Turkish Lukasz Kubot. To a lesser extent than Kubot, Tsitsipas – who was chasing some sort of No. 17 on Wimbledon Selection — advanced by only beating Wang Chiao and Lucie Safarova, but it wasn’t enough to stop Tsitsipas from becoming the first countryman to walk away with a Wimbledon singles title in a row.\newline%
On top of her status as champion and her 10th career title, Ksenia Pons (18) and Andrea Lim (29) were winless. Talia Ricco (30) came in fourth place.\newline%
Tomorrow is a full schedule of WTA and ATP{-}sanctioned WTA events which, with the season ending in September, should last another three or four years. Results with them should be updated from the meeting at Stanford, followed by a good view at Stratford where, assuming Williams splits and carries on, will Wimbledon survive:\newline%
