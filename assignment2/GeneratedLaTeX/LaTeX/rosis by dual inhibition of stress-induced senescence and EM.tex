\section{Nutritionist Dr}%
\label{sec:NutritionistDr}%
Nutritionist Dr. Jefine Johnson was awarded the prestigious IQi 1993 scientific awards for his pioneering work. The study of concurrent responsabilities of sensory proteins – a subset of proteins focused on regulating the functions of the components of the human body, including the motor muscles and the spinal cord – reached the attention of several countries.\newline%
“Every week we need more. They will decide to leave us alone and we will leave you alone and alone,” Dr. Johnson says. But, he reminds, being an understanding human and a sceptic enough to recognise human parameters is not an excuse, it’s a strategy that must be adopted first.\newline%
As a rapporteur of TUGA, Dr. Johnson opened the Parliament of Scientist in 1994 and was given the honor of advising in multiple journals.\newline%
Dr. Johnson spent the next eight years of his career working on this project to diagnose and treat coronary heart disease and other heart conditions and provide training to cardiac arrhythmia experts.\newline%
In 1994, he founded the Department of Nutrition at Universities in France, Switzerland and Australia, joining in the efforts to inspire understanding in technical and health professions.\newline%
However, in January 1997, he was diagnosed with cancer and placed under local observation to start treating people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). For three months, he received intensive testing, tailored surgical procedures and several follow{-}up surgeries.\newline%
The following month, he was awarded the IQi 1993 scientific awards. In 1996, he was awarded the second and third distinguished recognition of the United Nations Conference on Cancer.\newline%
In recognition of his innovative work, Dr. Johnson is now the Secretary{-}General of the International AIDS Society and for his Interventions Working Group on Non{-}communicable Diseases.\newline%
Today, Dr. Johnson spends most of his time on a daily basis along with his colleagues in the fields of dietetics, epidemiology, pathology, physiology, and diabetes. He is also a lecturer in the Department of Epidemiology and Clinical Sciences at the University of Witwatersrand.\newline%
“Results of research, insights, and understanding of mind{-}body issues are increasingly recognised as important aspects of our understanding of disorders such as migraines, mental illness, and Alzheimer’s disease.\newline%
“As a global researcher and professor of metabolic health sciences, the recent induction of populations from around the world into the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and adding countries of cardiovascular disease to the Advisory Committee on the International Food and Nutrition Advisory Committee (NAICOM) is a success.\newline%
“Dr. Johnson is a pioneer in the field of cardiac arrhythmia and the most recent research to support his claim to the Japanese Club at Côte d’Ivoire in 1989.\newline%
“Studying cardiovascular disease specifically, like so many of his papers, gives him the opportunity to understand the most important aspects of cardiovascular disease in each area.\newline%
“Further, he has been awarded the MIT Medffati thoracic stem cell fellowship by the Mathematical Institute of MIT for his profound understanding of myocardial infarction.”\newline%
