New data from NASA shows, quickly and unambiguously, that e{-}businesses can support a global business by building, leasing and managing digital media sharing platforms. This is because e{-}businesses are central to successful digital content distribution networks and e{-}commerce platforms for example, with sufficient supply of content to fulfil a given business needs. Such platforms are not separable, but product and model, and providing a digital platform that is efficient enough for the distribution of content and brands is what business requires.\newline%
As part of its 2017 Worldwide Digital Content Initiative, e{-}businesses have a rare opportunity to bring together this collaboration to define international content sharing models to support a global, multi{-}faceted digital content distribution industry, providing alternative technology and equipment from offshore provider to compete with their global peers. There is a leadership opportunity here for these telcos, we define partners as those local partner{-}fliers with good reputation and experience in digital content sharing technology. This allows for flexible local and international partnerships in addition to local frameworks.\newline%
For example, ALN{-}APTERNL – the innovative new messaging solution that works in the US, China, India and other markets – gives content creators the ability to easily take published content to an IP telephone network (which allows service providers to provide access to content across borders and in some cases to each other) if their target market has opted for either an aggregated local and international feed.\newline%
To foster this globally{-}driven ecosystem, ALN{-}APTERNL provides software{-}based easy{-}to{-}enforce wireless access management to targeted publishers and businesses to collaborate across geographical boundaries. In the US, for example, ALN{-}APTERNL enables content providers to aggregate local and international content by delivering the ability to "tailgate" private content to their local platform and post it live.\newline%
With the proliferation of new platforms and funding of new media companies, the private sector, we can create an ecosystem for new business partners, start{-}ups and wider audiences in most cases, where they will be able to offer core technology services, as well as new opportunities for new business partners, that will allow them to scale globally.\newline%
The ring{-}fenced international partners (e.g. the ECB) which will partner with the local telcos and large regional web companies, will, in turn, carry out tele{-}level trade and distribution across borders to drive cross{-}border content exchanges. This will be both feasible and efficient in terms of scale and is one of the critical features of this new ecosystem.\newline%
The real potential is not restricted to telcos alone, as there are other mutually beneficial partnerships available to be explored – particularly in the storage space and particularly with digital media specialists. "It's not just about work{-}life balance at the end of the day, but the fact that people are shifting skills and markets so that once they move on and play on the network they can quickly get hold of content, plug, create and buy through the networks," argues Lars Löpin, VP for IBM. The very nature of technology becomes a whole game at the end of the day.\newline%
We recognise that new business alliances cannot be brought together overnight, but there will always be teams from Australia, India, UK, Brazil, Europe and the rest of the world which can find a common interest and make an impact with a global set of local partners. By adopting this sustainable institutional infrastructure, we expect this ecosystem will not only enable opportunities to test and scale global content sharing, it will also offer new opportunities for brand{-}to{-}brand partners, and, potentially, new markets, that may not be available in their current geo{-}political context.\newline%
