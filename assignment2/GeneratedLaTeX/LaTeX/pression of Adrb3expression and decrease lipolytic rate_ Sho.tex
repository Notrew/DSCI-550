Try simplicity in printing the words to color your object and leave room for the words to be printed and the combination effect decreases lipolytic in the colouring film. Suzy Muir is a designer, teacher and journalist who lives in St Martin's Village.\newline%
I was born in Namibia and became a second born citizen in Namibia when I was a few weeks old. I grew up in Pira and attended Socksitive School in Black Bay. In school, I worked as a psychologist in an office which was well{-}run and was very nice. I liked working very hard and growing up I saw strong social values which were considered admirable. I thought if I could do this to my ancestors, I would become a professional writer for a magazine.\newline%
At age 13, I founded Mitte, a business incubator which was a good start for me as I wanted to become an entrepreneur. I had spent most of my life planning, organising and running my own businesses. My first sales were, as a teenager, two advertising posters.\newline%
Through the first nine months of her life, I was desperate to start my own business and aimed for success. I spent the first few months of her life at the very bottom of the village, hungry for ideas and asked her to pitch me ideas in her green room. Her first command was, "I will create products for you and I will make a difference," and since then, my ideas are successful. I don't think I have a green room to house them, and I have problems filling the tea cup sized packets, but my Green Room is still a top shelf.\newline%
In October 1992, I stopped training to become a magazine critic. When I started writing ads for hundreds of newspapers in Namibia, they encouraged me to set up a magazine. I just could not help myself. Once, I came across a magazine in trouble and was asked to apologise for what had happened. My decision is currently owed to the advertising community, which is a very important and expensive industry. I myself was a citizen of Namibia. When I first started writing ads for Namibian newspapers, I imagined some youngsters would be interested in the opportunity to market themselves in New Media media. But, unfortunately, a year of protest and industry scandal ruined my plans and career as the public servant. When I finally found peace, it proved to be my downfall. In December 1992, I attended a seminar at the Ministry of Peace and Reconciliation where my team was asked to negotiate a 'mothership' which was being given to Namibia. Today, I am the publisher of The Church of Namibia. In 1995, the first intesaption or superannuation scheme started and I had three choices before I accepted this deal. On the first choice was the sub{-}contractor, the national bank to subdue these workers on the spot or a consortium of four companies with contracts and management licences who are supposed to provide the care and service to the workers and the parents. On the second choice was the bankers.\newline%
Three months after launching, I had three areas of expertise: one for advertising, one for marketing purposes. Our third area was public relations and promotion, and our fourth part was marketing. In the end, I lost all connection with all of the fields I entered into and I sent my first editorial issues to some professional publishers. I had to surrender my real name and my job and give up my license for two years. I decided to give up my part in the community so as to get more training and exposure for myself. I left Namibia to open my own business, this is my first venture at the moment. I've been writing and speaking in Namibia for over 20 years and I've never had problems like this, so what has worked in my mind is that my first product has not changed in any way and in no way has it done harm to the nation or Namibia.\newline%
I don't know why, but I am a Singaporean by birth and the language barrier had never arisen before. I am the daughter of a Singaporean citizen who came here and married a Malaysian couple. My two husbands were Malaysian citizen, I worked as a financial analyst for a Singaporean bank, and both marriages ended when I was married. Both marriages fell apart at my age. I realised I was not the old woman I thought I was before entering this business. I spoke to my husband for a year, but he eventually ran out of the time to try my ideas and write more positive articles.\newline%
Today, I am well beyond the charm of a Singaporean, living in Namibia and Australia. I have written for over 100 newspapers here in the last year, now having written for international publications in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. I am also writing books, won 14 box box awards
