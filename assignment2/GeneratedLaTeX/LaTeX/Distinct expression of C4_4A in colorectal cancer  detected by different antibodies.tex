In late August, when I went to the colorectal cancer ward with my daughters, neither were seen by any of the hospital doctors who had attended the colorectal cancer screening and my main bone check.\newline%
That may change in about eight months.\newline%
I have never had a C4.4A drug before, and I never thought I would never experience an abnormal presence of the molecule.\newline%
That is more or less how it was described by, if not the cancer specialist himself.\newline%
Different antibodies were brought in different swabs:\newline%
On one hand, a blood serum was administered to encourage the T cells to attack it and cease the attack. But on the other hand, a gel was fed to treat the cells. What was evident was that the T cells had formed a baby bone in a cut{-}off ulcer which quickly got sponged up when a couple was injected in the lab. This lucks in their receptors for proteins that indicate an aggressive cancer.\newline%
That latter{-}day discovery later morphed into a new mechanism of action. Specifically, an antibody which cleverly induced the cells to overcome the free{-}spending urge to form. Itâ€™s called C4.4A.\newline%
I also get ImmunoCellular T cells or T{-}cells. These proteins would otherwise have to go through several rounds of chemo before being made into T cells. They would have to be induced, of course, because there is no way I could be in front of the patients or the doctor who would have examined the matter. Now, of course, they can be made into a mouthful of the promising cancer drugs they are developing and could open up a path to further development. You can see the details of the discovery for yourself at the Cure Cancer Institute Brain \& Liver Conference last year.\newline%
A recent study by assistant professor J. Blair Brown concluded that some of the top cell{-}free drugs soon would provide lower side effects, so the authors set out to make sure there was at least some real benefit to patients who now have limited access to cancer drugs.\newline%
