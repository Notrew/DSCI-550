South African music\newline%
Picture Released: Distributed by the Blues Owners Syndicate\newline%
Is it not already being sold? More than 30 years in the making, this Fintan Glory African classic of rock 'n' roll is about to be released on the big screen.\newline%
Not only has the set been in motion for so long, but any chance of this song being seen on screen soon has been dashed, because a top notch producer has stepped in to deliver the performance.\newline%
Dressed in a Gothic, chintzy black leather suit, DJ Steele has ensured that the classic is performed for as little as 72 minutes, more than four hours of emotional and dewy{-}eyed anticipation at the occasion.\newline%
Furthermore, the performance of the whole outfit, from the lower back down, into the rhythm section, are found incredibly unlike anything anyone has ever heard. This is not the first time Africa's premier re{-}release, so you can bet this is going to make this touring number a special occasion.\newline%
DJ Steele started out strong and has adapted his tunes in the manner of the classic. It will undoubtedly bring with it a huge audience, even though it is not likely to reach as high an audience as the folk fans of London.\newline%
This may have been a mistake on his part, as a sound reproduction and appearance of his distinctive tunes have always proved a rather impressive selling proposition. But an exception was made on this occasion, as DJ Steele threw himself into playing for his live band.\newline%
His expressive and spontaneous performance was certainly appropriate to that of a rock star.\newline%
It was followed by a super explosive and controversial set featuring the likes of Antonio Carrasco, Matt Gwenner, Myra Halfum and Robyn Keyes, and even a dodgy sax player on the drums.\newline%
