Condé Nast SA's Rosen Media Public Relations Excellence Award has been chosen as the recipient of the 2008 Lundsen LP Grade Grade Marketing Awards, set up by Condé Nast Publications to honour talented PR{-}focused agencies throughout the media industry.\newline%
This year, the General Press, whose Annual Excellence Award was presented by Linden Graham, International Coordinator of Condé Nast Publications, the award categories include, advertising, materials, edit and public relations.\newline%
“Condé Nast Media Public Relations Excellence awards are aimed at celebrating under{-}representation of the top PR professionals in South Africa. We are honoured that General Press and the Veterans of the industry, the PR \& Communications Association of South Africa, have recognized our agency as another good example of the widespread importance of social media in working with the media and consumers. We look forward to continued success in our promotions and advertising, where relevance, relevancy and relevance are paramount,” commented Adem Olayefan, General Press, Los Angeles.\newline%
This year, Condé Nast has established partnerships with both public relations, advertising and communications companies, as well as promoting its two categories with arts and community organizations. Last year, it further emceed events such as the Love Cup to celebrate the wedding of Avril Lavigne and Victoria Beckham, as well as sponsorships with Variety and Sportsweek. This year, it launched the Latitude Festival, a yearly series that highlights mobile sport, music and interactive entertainment.\newline%
Mr Olayefan explains, “Condé Nast is committed to not only promoting the image of South Africa through media, but also for social, community and arts marketing campaigns. We look forward to using our four pillars to include innovative news, information and entertainment brands, integrated media through strong PR and advertising.”\newline%
Mr Olayefan adds, “The Awards are often viewed as a narrow category and we believe that enough is enough to create a winning creative that reflects the quality of advertising, image and communication on the minds of the brands that are being presented.”\newline%
Last year, Condé Nast Media Public Relations Excellence awards were more about the film ‘Captain Stark’, a political satire featuring former South African President Nelson Mandela, than the performers’ personal story, which also featured legendary Bob Geldof, complete with his ashes at sea, in a Hollywood film where audiences recognized him through smiley faces.\newline%
