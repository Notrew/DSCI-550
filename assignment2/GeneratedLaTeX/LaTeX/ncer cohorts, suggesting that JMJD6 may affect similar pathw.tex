TelevisionDiary.za {-} The creative moves that have taken place around TV could affect the course of the entire film industry. Many filmmakers are thinking about creative methods differently and bringing a different approach to their filmmaking. They have the opportunity to make a standalone work from experience as opposed to practice audiences' creativity.\newline%
Parineeti Chopra is fresh off the release of her latest film 'Sonu Nigam', wherein she played herself in the role of a chef. Having to separate aspects of the film that were not caught up in a montage is certainly a scar and painful thing to consider when thinking about this fictional role. However, this film has brought an amazing amount of pleasure to the new face of TVDiary.\newline%
The cake trying to jump off the foundation\newline%
Putting together the film has been an intense task that made us gain an immense amount of admiration and appreciation for the artistry of Parineeti Chopra. Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan has produced her first film under her mom Anna{-}Sulana Dharma, along with her daughter. In the film, Shah Rukh's Aditya Chopra mixes the humour and satire of the subject matter in the the film. Whereas on the other hand, Parineeti has a much needed stage role in her latest film.\newline%
Hard wait at work\newline%
Even though her latest film is yet to get access to the big screen, the golden screen will surely bring to a close another milestone in what has been a fairly lengthy journey for her. Having played herself as part of the comedy trilogy, has been getting equal recognition in the industry.\newline%
For instance, she even received a commotion from the industry when it was discovered that she was dating a pal of Salman Khan's, director, Salman Khan's, Shah Rukh Khan. She was convinced that it was unfair that they were accused of cheating.\newline%
Casting will be the biggest experience for her. Having worked on such films as 'Idol', 'Home', 'Dolme ka Ladki', 'Neighbours', 'Tere Tiger Lover', amongst other, most of her career will surely happen with a few extra additions along the way.\newline%
Entry list\newline%
Not only will Parineeti be thrilled by her new role but the odds also look stacked against her. No actress in today's world can go under the radar when you have a fantastic performer and have relevant, both raw and sensual talent that you want.\newline%
Parineeti Chopra is without doubt a bold talent and if she plays it her way with true barristers, it will be her first double{-}version in a Hindi film after joining the big screen. Besides the fact that she will need a break soon to invest in her film, it's likely that this latest piece of cinematic endeavour will be extra appreciated as being in a difficult transition.\newline%
The winner will receive a Rs 2{-}crore payment after the completion of the film, a precious opportunity to learn from the industry leaders of the last several years, make some semblance of a difference, and then learn what truly impressed in the industry â€”\newline%
