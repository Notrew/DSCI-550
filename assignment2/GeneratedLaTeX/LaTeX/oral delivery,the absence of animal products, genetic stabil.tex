Global sales to the pharmaceuticals market fell in 1997 and life sciences fell,according to research by PetShop Research Australia,or Vaccines \& Medical devices,five months after registration.\newline%
The research indicated that medical devices last year had the highest double{-}digit sales growth in Australia and Europe.\newline%
Staff at both the Australian Foundation and the American Foundation for AIDS Research believe the pharmaceutical products released to current model IVAs in 1996{-}1997 are doing more harm than good.\newline%
"For example, Australian IVAs, a particular category, produced a rise in IVF fertility among Australian males (14 per cent), compared to study conditions in UK IVF (22 per cent)," says Marion Stewart, spokesperson for the US Foundation for AIDS Research.\newline%
"But IVF is an ongoing business model because the higher the price of IVF, the better the results they provide. So IVF take a long time, so it has done a lot more harm than good in developing countries."\newline%
Women's IVF is notoriously low{-}quality, because it requires injections of small amounts of fluid, not as large as conventional IVF procedures. It also has negative side effects.\newline%
Fertility rates for women aged 25{-}34 in South Australia have plummeted by 80 per cent since 1995 {-} it now only accounts for 9 per cent of female applicants to IVF for the first six months of pregnancy, according to Dr Rachel Billericay of the University of Sydney.\newline%
Although fewer women are enrolled in research to gain the financial resources to go abroad, the percentage is about doubling by 2001.\newline%
"More women on the up are taking IVF and injecting it," said Ms Billericay. "The numbers are steadily increasing.\newline%
"The uptake of IVF by western women has increased, but it is more for women who have incomes of less than \$11,000. As recently as three years ago, most couples were making \$8,000 or less."\newline%
A female IVF patient can produce 1000 grams of juice per day, and a man can produce 700 grams. Both groups have the highest percentage of high quality artificial steroplastone, a preservative used to treat intracranial vein hemorrhage from men, and pharmaceutical drugs.\newline%
Robert Thomson, editor{-}in{-}chief of Market Fever, Mr Thomson says many more options for IVF, including the high costs associated with IVF procedures, are available over the internet.\newline%
"The best advice to people is to use their mother's womb, but families can use IVF as a secondary method if they want to do it themselves," he says.\newline%
Families may also seek a cheaper alternative that will allow IVF to occur when the tumour is incurable, such as premature medical treatment, he says.\newline%
Australia is getting ahead of the trend and increasing the number of IVF clinics, says Dr Billericay.\newline%
"Five years ago people would get women or persons with renal disease diagnosed for trials for anti{-}inflammatory drugs. Now they have some information about IVF, and they have a sophisticated diagnostic test for hepatitis B," she says.\newline%
The top five drug sellers are Roche's Viagra, Pfizer's Viagra, and GlaxoSmithKline's AstraZeneca, according to the research.\newline%
