\section{AM{-}1 is the new title of the month for British jobs}%
\label{sec:AM{-}1isthenewtitleofthemonthforBritishjobs}%
AM{-}1 is the new title of the month for British jobs. The website, O, is relatively new and carries such deliveryable work titles as Business Manager, Business Associate, Daily or Energy Leader, Transport, Airport and also the Competitive Defence Leader of the Year. Hence, the title is called all{-}inclusive.\newline%
But AM{-}1, is more than just, that is {-} you have to be patient, especially because the site has actually hit trouble for some time now. Announcing the site last week, a man told PECAM in Johannesburg that he had to undergo detailed physical training to take part.\newline%
He added that while he was overwhelmed by the expenses, he was unable to take the plunge into GED and then qualified for unemployment benefits. Well, if you think it's tough for me now, I'll have to tell you, I can't help but be concerned.\newline%
In another interview in this edition of AM{-}1 this past week, Marketing Manager at Guildwave, South Africa, Bernard Warnica told PECAM, “If you push yourself to do something, when you get into the place and understand the background and the background of the organisation, it appears to make a big difference.”\newline%
Managing director of UK{-}based UK website The GCME, Phil Anderson, emphasised the importance of having good people and strong employees in the organisation. “Job input is critical. When you have those talents and abilities in place, you’re leading a team of people around to save hard{-}working people from losing their jobs” he said.\newline%
An unforgettable quote from AM{-}1\newline%
I’ve been through times when a job candidate was crying, eating nothing but ramen. I think I’m one of the few people to tell them that they’re not qualified to be an AM{-}1 employee and they must take extreme measures to convince that person. For example, they would never let me sit in front of them, take their cars out to the town centre, read too much into it. Having said that, AM{-}1 is a great name as we are genuinely looking for applicants with a passion for talent and passion for job creation.”\newline%
That must be reassuring news, but in fact, the AM{-}1 website had actually been operating for a couple of weeks when AM{-}1’s supply chain manager Angie Pherson complained that some deliveries had been late. This phenomenon, revealed by Linda Moody, Head of Marketing at EKED, is revealed by Dave Carrute at jobscaring.com. "This happens each day across the UK, and if you were to see it firsthand, it would be very concerning. What's worse, it's even more alarming when you wake up out of the woodwork having to worry that these package deliveries have been made late for you or your loved ones," she said.\newline%
So AM{-}1 was born?\newline%
Sue Christensen, MA, Merchant Merchant Analyst, AM{-}1 does not seem to mind, but she admits it's a bit of a let down. “When you run AM{-}1, you're aware that AM{-}1 hasn't been doing well. You're unaware that although the site is good, there may be more than one delivery problem. In general, I think that AM{-}1 is very unacceptably slow for delivery of products and services. It's not as if you're hanging them on the shelf and by turns no matter what, they never deliver," she explains.\newline%
However, that's actually what the site does. "AM{-}1 has a large resource centre and is a powerful means of cutting down the level of paperwork and making the website work better for all. It holds up amazing features when compared to other services such as pay{-}as{-}you{-}go packages," says Anderson. "I expect other companies will notice that a day or two would be needed to complete AM{-}1's challenges.\newline%
