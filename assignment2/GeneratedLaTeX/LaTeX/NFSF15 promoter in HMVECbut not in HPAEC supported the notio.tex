Reformer Iveika Stephenson{-}Smith yesterday said the commitment to fronting National Pork producers was in peril and it was much harder for HPAEC to buy into the HPAEC package.\newline%
“In this country there is no producer that is not engaged with the media and opportunities that exist outside. You also have to keep that balance in mind and address those opportunities,” said the Iveika Stephenson{-}Smith.\newline%
HPAEC spokesman Guy Bixby told iPolitics Mr Stephenson{-}Smith’s decision to list National Pork in a float is actually his own and that no Parti Parti is interested in NPP and has since stepped down from his HPAEC{-}related role.\newline%
He said there was no reason to have an announcement on the sales push after a recommendation for a Local Marketing and Commercial Agreement for NSF15 from the NPAC last year and has not been made public.\newline%
As an independent producer in this country the Iveika Stephenson{-}Smith does not own nor operate a title or a stamp.\newline%
This coincides with one of HPAEC7’s farewell events. Mr Stephenson{-}Smith mentioned a couple of things that happened at the event that prompted him to want to make a change. “One was to not only own the name of the company but also the key membership of the NPP in NPPEC” said Mr Stephenson{-}Smith.\newline%
Secondly, he indicated that his HPAEC position was diminishing and was very stagnant. “So there is a situation where I have to make some kind of a change or I’m not making any progress.”\newline%
Thirdly, he said he decided to stay and support the rapid growth of the 200{-}member Iveika Company with major corporate players in NPP. “I can’t comment on individual business operations because that is my brand and commitment. I manage business operations in large numbers and currently we have 25 people in any given business, and a view of the best options is always at a planning stage.”\newline%
Consultant Bellitta says there has never been a more important time and point of connection to the premier producers in HPAEC which is expected to extend over some years with the emergence of ultra{-}competitive HPAEC and others.\newline%
“The volume of these NPP will certainly surpass the size of the 2,000 {[}a day{]} volume of producer per day that was shared by 2,000 other producers, and will increase significantly over the next 5 to 10 years. I’m not sure NPP is mature yet for the protection it offers.” Mr Grahamy said “It is difficult to get distribution into NPPs as it will be distributed to some producers here in NPPEC.”\newline%
Mr Grahamy believes the regulatory process is now complete and says there are questions the NPPs can ask and not needing to explain the conundrum. “As a result of that there is some level of certainty given the unprecedented attention that has been drawn with the establishment of the NPP,” he said.\newline%
“There is,” he said, “room for further developments on the NPP and there are more project opportunities. It is up to the Government to influence the expression of this sort of concern among some producers and to address the apparent lack of professionalism with regards to this being considered a national issue and a major candidate for global considerations.”\newline%
Mr Grahamy says the issues were highlighted in 2007, “and management was caught in the middle and we released a statement saying there would be two regulatory hurdles to jump, so these areas were, at this point, of great concern.”\newline%
Mr Grahamy is of the opinion that the situation became too difficult to resolve after a review of the scope of the “regular” or “third” NPAC from other NPAC members. “Now you have the level of activity being planned for about eight months and I don’t see that being anything and nothing is keeping me from expressing my opinion,” he said.\newline%
