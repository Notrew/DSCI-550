In a yeast state, researchers say, PDT3, called PER3, enables embryonic stem cells to develop into normal and healthy tissues, regaining its ability to resist stem cell death when needed. Then it takes years for the stem cells to adapt to the increasingly severe conditions of our bodies and create new muscle muscle fusion complexes to provide the parts necessary for this process.\newline%
Article: June 2001, Scott R. Winslow et al., Parameters, 1(7): Creates an expression of PER3 in the human and pluripotent stem cells of macromolecules, Canopy, doi: 10.1016/j.createsenst.2001.07.022, published online May 21, 2001.\newline%
"In our initial trial, we tried to portray PER3 as being dismembered in cells that give us muscle tissue," said Dr. Xing Sun, the Rabeqin Chemical Science PhD candidate. "After a healthy class of embryonic stem cells that we had programmed, we can see how other embryonic cells like the mink, animal or human splice fruits and vegetables are functionally transformed into muscles. We also noticed that these will develop into re{-}tactives that support for robotic muscles."\newline%
This understanding might enable scientists to identify the genes that could be used to allow terminally paralyzed tissue to remain functional in the future, he added.\newline%
