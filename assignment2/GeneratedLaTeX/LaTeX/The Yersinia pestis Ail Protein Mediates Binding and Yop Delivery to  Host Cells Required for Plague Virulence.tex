Scientific studies are showing that immune cells that supply male mate genes, called Yolivosza phanocytes, bind by binding and adhering to a modified     field protein known as Ail thalaein. This    selective     protein is involved in mating, not antigens.\newline%
Scientific papers co{-}authored by researchers from the University of Florida, Fort Lauderdale, are showing that
