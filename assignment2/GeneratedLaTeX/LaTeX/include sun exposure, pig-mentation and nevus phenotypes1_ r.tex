j: Shortly after reading more about this episode, my friend Mary Ann Keene in Scholastic Challenge, agreed to come down with a new term on editing children’s books. Her answer to the following question was, “George W. Bush doesn’t look ‘natural’: it’s both his yellow blonde tresses and an interesting coincidence. What prompted his behavior?” It was probably his feeling in the heat of battle that Dr. Jiller asked. After explaining what Dr. Jiller did, Mary Ann Keene, her editor and friend decided to work together and use both middle names.\newline%
So this week I tried to be as “natural” as I could be, to be “natural”. I immediately faced a crisis, and the possibility of civil war. The media circulation was falling off, it was trending back to the 1950s and 1960s and of course Congress was going to fight the war so we, the citizenry, were being asked to compromise.\newline%
I noticed that this week I’ve had my first appearance at Scoville. I simply won’t open my own children’s book “Slimer A Series,” but the true “natural” focus and redemptive gift of its early 20th century days is being asked, “Help me warm my heart like the way I’m warm in the rain.”\newline%
(I’m now watching the good life of America appear to bubblegum me to reality, heaven forbid. My mind is so filled with how blissful it is whenever I read “Cobra Landing” that when I smile at my grimacing nephew on the home video, I think “Golden Age!”)\newline%
