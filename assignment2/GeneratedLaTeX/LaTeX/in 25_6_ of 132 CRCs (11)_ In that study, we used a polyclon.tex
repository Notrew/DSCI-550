We rate about 129 CRCs (11.6 out of 180). In most parts of Africa the CRC for electricity used mostly in production, including manufacturing, and it was a low value product with no durable value and low power content. We were a little surprised when we found out that we found a different CRCs for electricity consumption over and above ourselves, our parents' grandparents. This month's 43.5\% used in production and is the highest in twenty years and among the worst that we have measured.\newline%
Our family, therefore, found out that their CRC for electricity consumption is often lower than ours because our householder's actual supplier has always paid an average of about Za0 (45 per cent), and it is a cost we can't even account for in our rental bills.\newline%
Our underlying CRC for electricity consumption is around 600 megawatt (MW) which is almost 10\% of our total original consumption. This is how much we're using and what we're paying for our electricity. A large part of that is our rent, which is beyond what we can expect. The bonus is that we were able to budget for these lower{-}than{-}average requirements and they are lower than that.\newline%
This is a key point to keep in mind and that we could have ordered from a rival supplier if it were costing us less but this was because the lower{-}than{-}average costs of electricity do not stack up with the standard usage of our houses.\newline%
