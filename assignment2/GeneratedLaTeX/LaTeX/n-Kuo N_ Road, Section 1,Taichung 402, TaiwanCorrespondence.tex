Documents have been made available in the VOA scheme to both own and keep personal and privileged correspondence relating to information regarding the convoy's communications with the Malaysian national carrier Transport Indonesia Limited (TINSL) since May 1990.\newline%
The VOA has been negotiating with Transport Indonesia Ltd in an effort to obtain interim monitoring and buoys against any communication given to TINSL by Transport Indonesia without condition.\newline%
The correspondence, which relates to information concerning a convoy no further than 30 kilometres in distance of the Federal Training Command, Karachi, Pakistan, 40 kilometres from Port Arthur's Quetta port, will be presented to regulators in the resolution of this matter.\newline%
TINSL is a telecommunications company with more than 3,500 employees. It was founded in 1950, and its operations are based in the southern city of Karachi. In March 1991 it placed Kuala Lumpur{-}based TINSL under a container transfer agreement, but that has not yet been completed.\newline%
Since the group was founded, Transportation Indonesia Limited has been contacted by Transport Indonesia Limited for information regarding transfers in the interest of TINSL.\newline%
Two vehicles in TINSL's convoy have also been ordered to compensate Transport Indonesia for breach of the express agreement.\newline%
