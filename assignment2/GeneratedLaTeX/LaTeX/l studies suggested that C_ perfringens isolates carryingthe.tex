Using extracts from bacteria strains would extend healthcare in lieu of removing the granules of many products, researchers said in 2003.\newline%
The findings are based on testimony from 929 general medical practitioners during a series of interactive general medical video lectures and conferences.\newline%
Participants included 677 laboratory microbiologists, 520 infectious diseases laboratories, 331 paediatric neurologists, 13 physicians, 77 general information society professionals, 14 statisticians, over 50 teacher lecturers, 11 home health professionals, nine health related and scientific research students and one gastroenterologist.\newline%
The 929 participants were monitored to, during and after the presentations for approximately 3 to 8 weeks. Intercourse samples were then used for each method of investigation.\newline%
The ABCI reported that the following types of findings included: contamination of certain pharmaceutical products by certain bacteria strains in laboratory storage and production processes; continued decrease of maintaining formulations in cell lines; an increase in the production of certain products by certain microbes in laboratories; positive absorption of bacteria strains by antibiotic agents on consumer and unsanitary surfaces; toxicity of various manufacturers and manufacturer samples; contamination of material following testing of contaminants in testing of raw materials; and reduced laboratory utilization and improved long{-}term stool monitoring.\newline%
Methods of research were limited to specific tissues of bacteria strains: human types, infections and chronic conditions.\newline%
Both the ABCI and Australian Joint Agency for Medical Research were part of the network carried out by the Infectious Diseases Research Group.\newline%
The ABCI report was published in the British Medical Journal.\newline%
