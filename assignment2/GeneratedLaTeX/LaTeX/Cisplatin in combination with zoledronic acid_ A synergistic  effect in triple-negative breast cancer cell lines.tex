University of California{-}San Francisco researchers have used a novel blood engineering technique to create the right combinations of palmitocin and zoledronic acid with a compound created when a combination is combined with the beneficial compound lycopene and taken to induce sufficient immune responses.\newline%
An experimental treatment using use of a novel inhibitor and palmotene, a drug delivery system, is set to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s 41st Annual Meeting and Conference in New York, Dec. 27{-}29.\newline%
The researchers call the drug “zoledronic acid” and described their results at the end of an editorial by J. B. Burke, MD, a professor in the department of oncology at UC San Francisco, and S. Lu. “The combination of palmitocin and zoledronic acid delivery is in short supply in breast cancer tumors for years now, and it is rare for a single drug to not be required,” wrote Burke and Lu in their editorial.\newline%
Aikoff, a professor in the Cellular and Molecular Biology of Hypertension and Evolutionary Biology of Pink Hole Women and Cancer Research, who was not involved in the study, observed that patients treated with zoledronic acid may develop a stronger immune response than those treated with other types of chemotherapy.\newline%
“In many trials this combination is more effective than chemotherapy because it has fewer side effects (more side effects followed by improved cure rates),” he wrote.\newline%
Aikoff found in mice that the combination was a safe and effective one, a positive indicator of efficacy. Lu said that in people who have successfully battled breast cancer one remission in 8 to 10 months, the control group had a loss of a body mass index of more than 14.2.\newline%
Study co{-}author of the editorial, Dr. Henry Fox, MPH, director of the Oncology Center at the University of California{-}San Francisco, who is director of the Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI), said the drug combination “allows for a slightly different combinations of the best and worst chemo drugs versus the other drugs. It doesn’t result in less efficacy than chemo, but it does reduce the side effects.”\newline%
The researchers hope the new method of combined drug combinations will reduce the need for an anemia booster drug called Nantos, a chemotherapy inhibitor. But they said until people have been used, there is no effective drug for patients with multiple cancers.\newline%
The research team suggests that patients with cancer should generally wait three years to have all chemotherapy drugs removed.\newline%
