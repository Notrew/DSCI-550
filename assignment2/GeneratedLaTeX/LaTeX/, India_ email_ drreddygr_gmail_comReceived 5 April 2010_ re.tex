Yesterday, April 25, Microsoft Media Technology announced the launch of a software development kit known as EPS.SJ, its Sporza software product for developers and those with visual development skills for productivity e{-}mail and Web browsing.\newline%
At a press briefing at Microsoft's InfoWorld Business and Communications, Microsoft co{-}founder George Darwin said that the product was on track to address a range of requirements in next few months for professionals and their IT professionals.\newline%
According to Darwin, the EPS components include:\newline%
systems and methods to mine for best{-}in{-}class content and ease of application application actions. It offers technology consulting solutions, and provides a dynamic system for developers and IT professionals.\newline%
"It provides a product that can bring capabilities back to enterprise IT, so you can understand the needs of the whole enterprise, and that uses a small number of changes in technology and changes in software," Darwin said.\newline%
The product is modelled on the Microsoft Impact Tool, which has dealt with the maximum number of steps from an automatic attack to many right{-}handed users. These include finding a Web site to manage e{-}mail. And it provides the engine to monitor and manage content.\newline%
Asked if the company will try and sell the product to businesses, Darwin said that it will not be trying to "hold hostage" Microsoft Inc. in using feedback on the EPS product or to stress out the usefulness and opportunity of the product.\newline%
"There is no reason to hold hostage Microsoft Inc.," Darwin explained. "Microsoft is best equipped to achieve new IT needs and improving the progress in adoption of industry standards."\newline%
The patent filing shows that the EPS incorporates patented technologies for customers and companies and developed in conjunction with others to enable improvements in the ability to deliver technology to customers. The trademarked EPS material cites improvements in customer service, better productivity and more complete delivery of e{-}mail and web browsing documents.\newline%
"We expect to offer news reports to users for the first time in April," Darwin said. "Customers will be asked to do the thorough research they need to follow along the way in order to feel confident about making the best decision they are going to make."\newline%
Information technology pioneer Henry Austin says that intelligent people may be spending a lot of time trying to make their way through life while they are writing a business story in a notebook.\newline%
When asked if he was a Pentium user, Mr Austin replied, "I don't go there because I like v4.0. That is huge in my life, and it has been helping me. I do have enough stuff to do if I come in sick, and if I am happy. But I can put 10,000 words on there, and not spend any time with the end result."\newline%
The version 12.5 Communicator, released last month, will be used in â€œa flurry of transactions between end users that need to be done in this area as well as a variety of other tasks. The document format we are using will be Microsoft{-}centric and it will be Microsoft{-}specific," he said.\newline%
"We were able to get out of the Microsoft world in May when we came out of the hardware hardware space with the consumable ECM storage network, and from the very beginning we were using ECM as a reference point for we've been implementing on a large scale its concept of solid state drives and CDN (Network Appliance) drives. ECM caching is very stable and it's complex."\newline%
"And the one thing that has been pretty interesting is that we are not, at least this is the beginning of introducing ECM to production environments, we are going to get into planning, development and design, strategic planning, data networking and the like," Mr Austin added.\newline%
"This is our first market application licensing deal that we had with a company in that category. We expect that this will be software{-}defined networking, and it's possible that this will be software{-}standard business software, including branded E{-}mail and web browsing. There are other software{-}defined applications where you can do a lot of customization or some other enhancements. This is a software{-}oriented thing and we are currently in the process of locking in content and Web browsing use cases at the same time. In other words, we're going to make it an immediate no{-}cost market as opposed to perhaps a pain{-}free market."\newline%
The EPS product is available through a website now and will be a major technology hit, said Steve Mandell, CEO of Computer Bureau Inc., an IT consultancy and a partner at Adam Morgan \& Associates.\newline%
They won't release Microsoft's XML product because it's a gimmick to do so, he said.\newline%
