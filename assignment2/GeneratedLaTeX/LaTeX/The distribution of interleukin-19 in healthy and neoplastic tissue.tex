\section{(Klayins) BTH (bipolar disorder) is a major disorder of the nervous system}%
\label{sec:(Klayins)BTH(bipolardisorder)isamajordisorderofthenervoussystem}%
(Klayins) BTH (bipolar disorder) is a major disorder of the nervous system. The neural and visual sense system of the brain has been shaken, even though most young people currently experienced their first major neurological disorder when they were about 15 years old. The central nervous system, which includes the middle and upper limbs, is the organ responsible for the central nervous system and its movements. It isnâ€™t clear what caused Klayins to experience such symptoms.\newline%
In the current study, researchers published their results in the journal BMJ Open.\newline%
