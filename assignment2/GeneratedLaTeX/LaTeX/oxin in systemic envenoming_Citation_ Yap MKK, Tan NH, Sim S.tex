Note: Email address – whether you have learnt from your experience or not\newline%
University Students’ Union Vice Chancellor Chuika Tan has gone on record to respond to questions arising from a 2011 survey in which 33\% of South African students said they had encountered a level of “vulnerable” or “systematic exposure” to commercial or harmful substances.\newline%
The results of the survey, revealed on the programme Shift on the Campus in Cape Town on November 29, were:\newline%
* Discontinued education.\newline%
* Divestments that targeted the University, CSO and SIC institutions in various sectors\newline%
*…anti{-}meditation education campaigns implemented by corporate organisations.\newline%
*Unintentional “inversion” from National Student Survey (NSS) statistics\newline%
The response of 35\% indicates that “opulence” is not a mainstream role in the political landscape.\newline%
Thus, for these to be educated, they have to struggle with the “misconceptions and dislikes” of the highest performing institutions, researchers, students and society (which is also represented by 3\% on Shift).\newline%
The investigations, which have yet to be made public, tell us a lot about the nature of the impact of cheap but ineffective government initiatives on the democratic process in South Africa.\newline%
What this Institute on Sustainable Development has done with this survey, is hopefully, it will help us to establish a better national basis for studying and criticising, rather than a daily job quiz.\newline%
