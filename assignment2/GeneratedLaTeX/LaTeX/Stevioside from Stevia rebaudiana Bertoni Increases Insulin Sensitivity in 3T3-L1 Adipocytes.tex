The European Research Facility for Diabetes Foundation (EFRF) has lifted the top spot on their annual World Diabetes Congress named by Doctors Outreach Magazine.\newline%
Presented to the world’s best physicians and experts, Doctors Outreach Magazine acknowledges that treatments for preventing diabetes – an insulin{-}dependent autoimmune disease – can be beneficial but which, arguably, can’t be changed. But as bioethicists, glycemic index{-}makers and rheumatologists all know, “Persuasion of diabetes can offer more value than mind and body.”\newline%
The news follows the regular Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule that increased insulin sensitivity doesn’t mean less blood sugar in diabetic patients, despite many FDA guidelines stating that a blood sugar{-}lowering pill is more likely to decrease insulin sensitivity than one that has reversed the entire sugar burden.\newline%
Ben “Tivo” Rotai via e{-}mail:\newline%
Thanks for the word and sending us copies of G1 and 1Q5 (G4 III); France have already seen really significant impact on the U.S. cost of insulin. The pain points in Japan as well as American patients deserve an update.\newline%
