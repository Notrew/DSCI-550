QS is a new generation of telecommunication technology that exists in several regions worldwide and represents a golden opportunity for nations to jointly test and reap the benefits from this technology. QS identifies and translates key transactions and control actions into real time signals.\newline%
QS means decentralised voice and data interchange, as well as the QS combination technology used in different industries, and is deployed in areas such as network services and delivery systems. It is the globalisation of communications from the PC to mobile telephones that defines our collective knowledge of the Internet.\newline%
Communications devices now meet the demands of technology, and QS provides a new means of facilitating connections. In effect, QS is the cockpit for a globalised future.\newline%
The concept is critical to use or develop in Africa and Australia, the world's largest nations, and the world's biggest operators {-} AT\&T, BellsTalk, ZTE and others. Similar to telecoms in this round, QS offers unique solutions for all South Africa citizens.\newline%
The key to QS deployment\newline%
QS is adapted as a global regulator of communication with global and regional standards through its very touchable PCB interface. Unlike conventional CCIS, QS offers worldwide operational operations, not just in South Africa and Australia, but across all countries.\newline%
In addition to this, QS is the single{-}platform communications intelligence used in the national and regional telecom service providers, like Telecom Victoria, Telecom Europe, AsoF, Canada Telecom Services and of course the Blackberry Enterprise Trust.\newline%
On the premise of achieving higher data throughput and value{-}added services, QS provides a business{-}wide monitoring system of all leading providers of customer services: Unbound, Unbound, Unbound, Business Accenture, Jaxtram and Alltel. It also incorporates analytics (contrastology) to help customers determine the relative performance of various leading telecommunications providers to accurately measure its cost effectiveness and predict outcome.\newline%
In this round, all key delivery systems, units and service levels must be robust and reliable, saving valuable customer resources, financial flexibility and so on.\newline%
Multichannel models, traffic, a speed and aggregation play a large role in business logic{-}to{-}business models. In this round, QS supports all industries and markets and can support small players, markets large and small with the flexibility of a single wholesale infrastructure like telecom network or a commercially backed network like Verizon.\newline%
By featuring QS, the world's largest broadcasters and technology companies, can provide customers with high{-}quality services while providing an extremely reliable transmission service for a number of specific industries. These services have become increasingly sought after in many countries and markets, with companies increasingly choosing QS solutions that only incorporate local features.\newline%
Saving time and money\newline%
Nowadays, telecoms operators are gradually installing QS for all 4G networks, which can now be configured to provide VOD content and high{-}speed storage.\newline%
We are working to deploy QS and QSCHI globally to lower down time to service costs. At the same time, QS intends to strengthen the capability of administrators to contribute significantly to lower costs. Now, Cisco and Samsung are still in the early stages of their project.\newline%
China is a unique region and the demands of its population are increasing as education rises and more and more countries increasingly connect via mobile devices. However, there are still concerns that we will be able to distribute data fast. This will further increase the economic power of Western countries and as a result, mobile phones and now smartphones. And many nations are investing heavily in mobile communications infrastructure with QS rapidly becoming the preferred technology, and with all purpose to take advantage of this technology, especially in Africa.\newline%
