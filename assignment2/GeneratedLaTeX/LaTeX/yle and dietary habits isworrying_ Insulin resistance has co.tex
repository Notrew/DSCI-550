\section{Simi Valley is considered "the farm town" of South Africa, with each day the R1}%
\label{sec:SimiValleyisconsideredthefarmtownofSouthAfrica,witheachdaytheR1}%
Simi Valley is considered "the farm town" of South Africa, with each day the R1.2 billion (Â£3.5m) of purchase options available to people. However, it is located much further south than Johannesburg, Darmstadt and Milan.\newline%
Farmers dominate in these fields with total options ranging from on{-}farm land (150 acres) to university tenders and universities, even for agricultural workers {-} more than 40\% of the population is over 60 years old, and often within the middle part of university campuses, overlooking beautiful beaches.\newline%
While there are companies trying to "grow" these fields, many have no plans to invest in them or see their potential grow. In fact there are applications for hundreds of these area white farms to exist, some to supplement the land banks of more ideal agricultural fields, others to appease investors and farm clubs. And now, after UN UNSW healthcare program, the Tanzanian government has approved plans to put more than 100 new white farms in the country.\newline%
Environmentalists are worried the success of these farms could affect the environment, such as repaying the government for environmental impact, taking on logging, killing deer and increasing health risks. The Tanzanian Government has told the federal government that a decision on the use of these rural farms for development is coming to a vote in August, but parties so far did not want to negotiate with it.\newline%
According to Georgian blogger Vilbongisa Usheradze, the problem is a symptom of the disease plaguing the country: "The extreme scarcity and shortage of inputs to farming in the South African border has, so far, created a constant supply of antibiotics to tackle the diseases of the disease," she wrote.\newline%
At the present time, Zuru vice{-}chancellor Michael Jacobson says an estimated 90\% of all women are born on Cape Town's eastern doorstep. Yet this social, economic and environmental problem is extremely acute: at present, according to the World Bank Africa{-}Zuru chapter, the river Thames, between Tanzania and Angola, is insufficient for twice the number of rapeseed and rapeseed powder powder crops (21,000 hectare).\newline%
Jacobson cautions that this rising demand alone can slow down the mining of the South African creeks and the growth of flood control schemes. "All this madness is attributed to factors which include the poverty in the modern world, negative growth in the industrialised world, the poor use of forests by private miners," he said.\newline%
To cope with this plague, Jacobson has proposed increasing the green and high level of sustainable agriculture. "There should be intensive greening of the countryside," he argued. "We need to invest in Green Grappling Ecosystems which provide green vegetables, fruits, flowers, fruits, cabbage, lamb, cabbage (poultry) and cattle. There should be a grass grain stall to raise the quality of green growing, and progress from hand{-}knitted hoards to green tanks for measuring or raising livestock to ensure proper space for wildlife."\newline%
But despite being an agrarian country, a key section of the Tanzanian political landscape is many years behind the South African trend. Despite up to 100,000 new farm and hospital projects per year planned throughout the country, students who are currently enrolled in university will still be getting an education at the global teaching university and at regional centres.\newline%
"There are many hurdles to overcome that the USA did not address; the two states, US and Australia have problems. High unemployment, widening inequality, lack of skilled workers and growing poverty, which are factors that has threatened this country's development efforts," he continued. "The decision in Tofadiko to implement green building schemes is not simply about building green infrastructure but about choosing partnerships with universities to develop similar programmes."\newline%
