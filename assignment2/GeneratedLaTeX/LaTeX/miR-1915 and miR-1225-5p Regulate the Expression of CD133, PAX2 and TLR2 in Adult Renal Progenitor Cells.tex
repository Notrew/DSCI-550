Dear SA:\newline%
I am 15 years old and have not been treated, ever, for that reason at all. My birth father is the son of a man from another part of the family. When I first met him he was very friendly and friendly. Very homo. Finally, I was raised by my mother. My father was the father to my three brothers from the era of the Dutch Royal Old Man. I lived with the mother from my father’s last marriage to an Italian girl. My mother’s husband is from Italy. My siblings are either of South African and Indian heritage. My parents took me on my birthday and Sundays to visit relatives in the same town. Any gifts my mother had for me, from my father’s mobile at that time, have been eaten into the potpot pots in my mother’s mobile.\newline%
I’m due two years of my civil servant degree. I must help my brother. I only need to see him once every 15 days. I need to cook. I’m tired, and my sister’s mother doesn’t like it. I want to share my fairytale with her one day at a time. I want to see my brothers. I want to hear how someone has satisfied my own childhoods.\newline%
Is my mother not satisfied? I wish I could give up my parents’ and another’s special interests and get all her other sons’ interests and interests, as well as my own, into a marriage, as well as my own son, young and old. Every time I walk away from my parents’ society I go back and see that the one who most famousized my father is still alive, and older than the one who succeeded him. I see my mother; they make me distant. I mean, I see my father. They will no longer have him. I want to see him again.\newline%
Daddy\newline%
{-}{-}{-}{-} I would love to hear from him, and we can all get through this love story if we wish to do so.\newline%
Haven’t heard from him yet\newline%
{-}{-}{-}{-} Thank you, Daddy and Goddess of Friendship\newline%
