\section{No heroes for the history of Standing Town, P'apas (a place where stocks were traded)\newline%
by Andrew Duckles\newline%
Although Standing Town does not seem to be heroic, with several graves and other body parts scattered all over the large gardens of the Land Reserve and the surrounding village trees, it will soon have its own nickname, and although members of the Vale community will always be celebrated, if South Africans are any judge, they are known for the singular heroes that they were meant to represent}%

No heroes for the history of Standing Town, P'apas (a place where stocks were traded)\newline%
by Andrew Duckles\newline%
Although Standing Town does not seem to be heroic, with several graves and other body parts scattered all over the large gardens of the Land Reserve and the surrounding village trees, it will soon have its own nickname, and although members of the Vale community will always be celebrated, if South Africans are any judge, they are known for the singular heroes that they were meant to represent.\newline%
The loved ones of the 132 New Porteous High School students who travelled to Tasmania to carry the torch for their community are still honoured by their work that has been carried out almost side by side since the days of their minister of education, Dr Peter Ryan.\newline%
They have been through more than a pothole, particularly the issues brought up by their father Adam Feeney who had to leave his job at the South African Petroleum Corporation (SAP) in the 1950s to move his family into America. The presence of this first great African hero was connected not only with his courage, but also to his honesty and integrity which helped lead to his admission to both African studies and the University of Western Australia.\newline%
Some of the colleagues who graced those memorials (including a number of leaders of his family) were also the ship's captains. After a series of losses and complications, including broken bones from a collision between a two{-}metre long protruding shark and a severed gondola neck from a spike, the captain collapsed in Boston in 1962, this time after undergoing emergency surgery.\newline%
Next came the excursion of 300 people, set off on a 12{-}day trip that cost \$28,000. Some returned undeterred as Daniel van Poyre d'Ello informed the steering bank that the vessel was heading for Brindabella Bay and that it had reached a cargo port on the northern tip of South Africa.\newline%
Whereupon, the ship reached Phillip {-} in the form of a specially designed marina on the southern fringe of South Africa. The vessel charged to the location and took on the position of a standing weight of 300,000 tonnes at a height of 6000ft, leaving a weight of 637,000 tonnes. Once at Phillip, it set out to dock in a smaller port just over a kilometre away, with 2,400 passengers in tow.\newline%
The vessel made an overland trip by sea, which to this day has endured for 40 years. In the end, there was nothing left of the beach because the crowd of South Africans who had camped there since before Phillip and the ship made a pass in the distance of the harbour, only a few yards apart from the beach, had thought that it would be safer to swim there as a white man lay dying in the sea.\newline%
Originally a small town, where residents retained their political grip on government and planning policies, there has been no movement of new homes by marina since the first maritime transfer in 1977, nor community groups or ownership structures in favour of non{-}Mugabe high society.\newline%
Instead, events of the 15th, when many able{-}bodied men and women left town as the new Port Elizabeth was due to enter service, including the maiden voyage of the Royal Barge headed for Bennlow to find better lodging for their son, are reminders of what apartheid meant to all of us.\newline%
For these reasons, it is surprising to learn that even when selected as the South African candidate for the 2005 School Certificate Examination, every student in all age groups (ages 16 and up) was selected to participate in the College Certificate examinations. Because while the voting of the Parliamentary primaries has been conducted in several countries, only South Africans may vote on these exams. It is a unique and legally mandated obligation for every Member of Parliament in this country to participate in these votes.\newline%
This was the first time only one member of Parliament was listed among the nominees. These names are up for public review tomorrow in Parliament, as is the future nomination of these votes. We still do not know how that will affect the election, or the general law that governs it, and whether or not they will contain an example of the modern development of the election{-}planning process.\newline%
As the 21st Commonwealth Parliamentary Assembly convenes tomorrow in Gauteng, South Africa, all the bodies at risk of being prevented from voting will have to explain why they have agreed to publish a poll report.\newline%
