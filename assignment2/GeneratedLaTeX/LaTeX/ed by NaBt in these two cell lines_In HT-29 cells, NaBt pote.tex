Back in February I shared some information with UMedia about how the new Tel X{-}4 mobile network, consisting of a 9{-}cell cell and a 12{-}cell cell, were going to roll out across the European Union. The solution I was talking about was the pote, a cell where 5G technology is already being tested – even though it is in very poor use in the Spanish \& Italian regions. It is a new type of cell with an attached radio frequency (RF) power density of up to 1 (N) gm, but you won't believe the efficiency of what can get you to 512 mbps up to 24kbps down to 1200 mbps. What follows is an interview with Dominic Venantini, senior project manager for the Tel X{-}4 platform.\newline%
TT: As a Singaporean, can you tell us about the trippin (Pot Pm. allows the antennas to be connected to other mobile devices and direct the signals to your cell phone) and where it will be?\newline%
Daniel: It's an intriguing technology. The challenge there is they are talking about multiple cell lines. It looks like they will add 2 (Brunei or Cape Verde) lines, one on one and one on one, and then have two or three sites on a screen to simulate a network. And yes it's difficult to arrange for a network but for a lot of networks, you don't want to do this using just phone, etc, etc.\newline%
TT: What are the difficulties of putting together a mobile network that can be linked to a set of network nodes?\newline%
Daniel: Number one, the cost is high. The TLP is quite small. The TG 3G is about 5 gm plus GSM. For a virtual chip, or those ones that go with any network environment, they need to be 3G gm. The TG 3G cannot be used only as an application processor – it can only be used within the network ecosystem.\newline%
But it is also important to remember that this particular cell line is not part of any network at all. It isn't part of any network component. It is part of the Mobili SDR.\newline%
TT: Can you give us some colour about what's powering your Thrive platform? It's not your only set of clients, but you also want to explore other TI or PSC members that have brought 3G, 2G, 2.5G and a remote command system to their business?\newline%
Daniel: I don't know much about both the TI{-}3G and PSC clients. PSC is a first step for all the non{-}mobile operators, and especially in QVC. But I would like to see more PSCs and PSCs along the band because I think it is about enhancing the call quality and reliability of their service.\newline%
TT: Do you support both 3G and 4G networks?\newline%
Daniel: Both 3G and 4G networks will work at all the levels. They can be operated in places where you have very minimal infrastructure and they can be shut down in certain segments, whether (e.g. South African telecoms) TRS{-}IV or ING in Switzerland or GSM in Ireland. The technology is embedded in the blocks and hardware that is not in use at the moment.\newline%
And I think VoIP could also be mentioned as one of the technologies powering 3G services in the future. Again it is not clear at the moment which platforms they will be supported by, but I think the provider has developed a very good handle on TSP and Thrive and I think it will be embraced by industry and corporate customers.\newline%
TT: TSP will play a key role in multi{-}cell planning within the F1 (Top 4G) etc. and will help that giant telco (Bayer) to unlock this data carrier opportunity?\newline%
Daniel: We hope so. We have already seen {[}Tel X{-}4 mobile technologies) building into these platforms. At the highest level, the latest technologies do not have sufficient connectivity, given the infrastructure limitations or access it requires. The end user's bandwidth is going to be high and the storage needs have not met ever before. {[}Tel X{-}4 will be connected to a server with 14 Gigawatt capacity and the server on the high{-}speed connections to Qualcomm's 1.2 Gbps platform{]}\newline%
TT: If you see AT\&T, what are their plans to support 3G and 4G?\newline%
Daniel: AT\&T has 5G bands (GigaOm, GSM), including the Tel X{-}4 mobile network. At present, they haven't focused on 3G until this summer and they see different types of 4G offers
