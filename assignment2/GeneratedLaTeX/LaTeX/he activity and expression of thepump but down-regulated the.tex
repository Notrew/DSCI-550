Being accessible to all means has led many people to generally hold back from engaging in any more than mildly new online activities, experts say.\newline%
Commercialisation of Internet activity in a public sector environment such as the UN ranks 40th in the number of public company assets, a placement firm says.\newline%
John O'Brien, chief executive of bncoffti.com, says: "Although government has a quarter of its strategic assets from government paid for and owned and used for use, the majority of its enterprises are corporate one â€“ sometimes even each of the three tiers. It's not that their IT is out in the open, but the net services are access points to large companies."\newline%
According to ISO 49500 issued standard 1998, which recognises the role of government agencies in national planning of information and communications technology (ICT) matters, most of the companies in Government in Government in Public Sector Operating Markets have a net service{-}servicing business in public sector.\newline%
O'Brien notes that the nine bncoffti{-}funded public services that Bncoffti provides include information technology (IT), security, communications, health and defence. Government purchased a number of these these services in exchange for its own investment in the technology, says O'Brien. "However, government is constrained by its regulatory obligations, it has to establish partnerships between government agencies and institutions, while at the same time maintaining control of online information creation and control and access.\newline%
"Government can be a key force in ensuring all major integrated systems, including cloud, multimedia and voice applications and large data infrastructure and applications, are created in a one{-}way manner. Networking, online, voice and communication services may not be needlessly available, simply because the National IT {[}information, communications and insurance{]} allocation is in the public sector."\newline%
The fact is that the consumer tools that provide that access usually require significant changes for it to work effectively and efficiently, explains Mirenggi Kanieli, senior research associate at the Centre for the Study of Public Administration at the University of Pretoria. He says that despite advances in technology such as encryption, analogue utility and 4G networks, many public services remain, so that they no longer have the ability to communicate with each other as well as communicate effectively and optimally with themselves.\newline%
This means that almost as soon as the individual attempts to communicate with one another, the new systems are redundant. The bigger the difference, the harder it will be for the authority to maintain a synchronous relationship, he says.\newline%
"The new communications infrastructure can be very complicated in areas like the natural language technology of our country, where we don't have a shared expertise, but are indeed limited to business functions.\newline%
So as we benefit from the changes in communications and trust the services they provide, we will better reflect the private sector's relationship to our public sector. Governments now have to adopt strategies and make concrete public policy decisions based on those that best suit the public interest," Kanieli added.\newline%
He says that in the modern economy, consumers will ultimately be the best consumers. But public firms must also carry on delivering services with robust use, he says. The United Nations Security Council has laid the foundation for the General State of Information in the Digital Economy\newline%
