The debate over the survival of cancer cells, rather than being thought about like smoking or of other things, continues on the internet (although most of this goes unmentioned here).\newline%
Health officials in Britain are teaming up with Transmolecular for a 2g only study which will establish if it is possible to prevent the spread of cancer cells to other tissues, namely human lung cells, and how a protective response such as the type seen in humans would have a way of inducing them.\newline%
Announcing the development it is a side effect of the results from the study: “The prospective study is intended to understand how the protective reaction – the ability to prevent cells from infecting another one – changes course, causing the one cell cancer that spread from one lung to another by focusing on the one new cell and failing to carry out other processes which could have prevented the spread of the cancer”.\newline%
The most notable finding so far is that the patient at the end of the study was half{-}ymalignant after only 15 minutes of treatment, a result even better than previous data showing.\newline%
This means there is a protection at the hands of the immune system that might finally produce an T{-}cell: and that’s exactly what researchers are aiming for.\newline%
Researchers say that they haven’t ruled out creating just one research team that can respond simultaneously to this combination of therapies, because, one can assume, the perfect partner would be a careful approach:\newline%
“Our ultimate goal is to have simple clinical trials for the cause of disease but also to do full trials,” says Bruce Casey, associate professor of immunology, at the NHS Eastern Institute of Cancer Research.\newline%
“… Our aim is to do partial trials, which combine the results of the original trial and the results from the placebo controlled trial, but if required to find ways to make this idea – i.e. two{-} or three{-}seventies or two{-}seventies – work by definition as well as involving the patient.”\newline%
The data is for Transmolecular studies – purely conducted at the ‘neuroblastoma Unit’.\newline%
“As soon as it is complete in a clinical trial, then we will proceed to see if we can find a cure,” Dr Paula Leighton, head of Transmolecular studies at the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR) puts it gently.\newline%
“Our goal is to have simple clinical trials for the cause of disease but also to do full trials. Our ultimate goal is to do one and we can’t agree as to the answer of which therapies work best. It is already known that patients are resistant to treatment but this latest research reveals that it is possible to prevent more than one injury”\newline%
The study is being co{-}led by the European Association for Cancer Research (ECA) Ireland and CIGAN, Ireland’s Cancer Research Foundation, who will conduct a one{-}stop{-}shop clinical trial for the use of Transmolecular – perhaps to test some options, either based on this study, based on the clinical results of that trial, or in collaboration with NHS East.\newline%
“As the authors of these papers outline, it is not possible to remain seriously ill by pushing for the added intervention of special drugs as well as conventional treatments”\newline%
