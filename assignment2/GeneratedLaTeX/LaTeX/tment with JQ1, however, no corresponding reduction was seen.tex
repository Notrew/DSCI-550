\section{The fourth quarter of this year represents a slight improvement over the 3}%
\label{sec:Thefourthquarterofthisyearrepresentsaslightimprovementoverthe3}%
The fourth quarter of this year represents a slight improvement over the 3.6\% drop in the third quarter. Although overall growth rates were up 2.4\% in the third quarter, their sectorwide performance, which had seen a 15.4\% increase in GDP, was set to decline 0.3\%. But for the fifth quarter, private firms managed to improve, growing 0.4\% for the fourth quarter and 1.1\% in the full year, despite a 15.3\% contraction in the fourth quarter.\newline%
Organic growth to have declined 0.3\% during the third quarter. However, a preliminary analysis suggests that total revenues increased 10.7\% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, indicating that growth in the industry slowed down. “The drop in new business has also been slow,” says analyst Johannes Woelby. “All four of our businesses had growth rates greater than 1\% in fourth quarter. All four are still showing new business growth rate of around 2\%.”\newline%
Sales rebounded in the fourth quarter by 19.6\% in local currency, but fell only 0.7\% for the full year. Firms with positive growth rates show a 38.7\% drop in sales over the first half of this year and an 11.8\% drop for the full year.\newline%
Sales growth dipped 0.3\% for the month of January as domestic consumer spending increased as well as overseas growth of 3.6\%. While that wasn’t better than expected, when you factor in the obvious seasonal effects, but a return to growth was nonetheless reported, although the profit impact wasn’t fully reflected in the figures.\newline%
Prices dropped 0.4\% in local currency for January, while turnover was at the same levels as for the fourth quarter, suggesting that a fourth quarter increase in domestic sales wasn’t indicative of a definite decline in domestic sales.\newline%
Price may have been a culprit for the increase in ticket prices, though price adjustments are an issue for most businesses. Furthermore, once you factor in price fluctuation, you should be able to see what actually drives the average ticket prices down. The most common mark{-}up was 17.7\% compared to 12.1\% for the full year; a similar trend was seen in the third quarter.\newline%
Most household brand{-}name products outpaced construction equipment, with sales of 46.4\% in January, up 0.3\% from the previous month. Consumer electronics saw the biggest growth, with 32.3\% in January, up 5.7\% compared to the previous month. Building products up most, with sales up 7.5\%, while cable was the second most popular, at 13.6\%.\newline%
The Czech Republic showed the strongest growth, going up 0.7\% in January, while the United States was flat. The Czech Republic also contributed to the increase in sales, with growth of 8.4\% in the fourth quarter. Even with the increased increase in domestic sales, the manufacturing sector is still showing weakness, although unit volume declined.\newline%
On the other hand, workers’ compensation saw some good news. The firms with the highest joblessness index for the fourth quarter were followed by health services. Those with the second highest rate of unemployment grew their payroll bill by 1.4\% in January.\newline%
Full{-}year domestic sales for all of the firms increased only 1.6\% in local currency, below the 3.8\% increase in local currency for the full year, which suggests that businesses are shying away from large growth categories.\newline%
