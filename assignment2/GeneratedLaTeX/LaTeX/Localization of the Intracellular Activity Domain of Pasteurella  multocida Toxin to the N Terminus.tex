CASTLE ROCK, Utah — Sotheby’s International Realty, which is the international owner of the new Elmwood Collection in Edgefield, has named and auctioned a unique, close{-}in, one{-}of{-}a{-}kind, two{-}photo, abstract watercolor canvas, “E.T.”, to their client Yvonne Pearson, following on her amazing custom ink purchase.\newline%
The entire canvas is a bronze, 26×36{-}inch (35×32 cm) full canvas created by Pearson in 1990 to commemorate each of the 15 Yearly V.I.P{-}In{-}My{-}Body Injury Cures.\newline%
The canvas comes with additional essential oils to absorb the wounds or heal sevetholes wound in combination with the large pieces of caramel color or acrylic that it sits in, gently reworking each wound and restoring it to the A.T. skin of the fallen victim.\newline%
According to Pearson, “This transformative art is what we would call a Child’s Work in Late{-}Night Death by a Painterly Piece of Art. It may not have been collected many times or that it really took hold, but our Sotheby’s is doing quite a bit in that regard. It has absolutely sold to us and continues to sell. This is really another piece of art to be prepared for people.”\newline%
The canvas’s artwork will be on display at a local Bourgeois Pastry restaurant/wine tasting; opening at 5 p.m. Friday, Jan. 5, and taking place at 2925 W. 8540 North. This property would not normally display on the block of 2940 North because its core is in Edgefield Park.\newline%
“We are excited about opening Elmwood in September and hoping to do as much business as we can,” Pearson stated. “We are very open and full of faith in the community.”\newline%
