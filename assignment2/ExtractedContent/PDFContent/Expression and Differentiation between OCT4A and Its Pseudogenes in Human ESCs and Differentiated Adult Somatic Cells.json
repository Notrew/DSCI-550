This critical role of OCT4 is maintained inembryonic stem cells [7\u201310], the developing germline [11\u201313],and germline tumors, such as seminomas and embryonicteratocarcinomas [14\u201318]. When inducing pluripotency in differ-entiated cells, OCT4 appears to be an essential, but not the onlyrequired transcription factor [19,20]. OCT4 acts as a transcrip-tional activator of genes involved in maintenance of undifferen-tiated state and as a repressor of differentiation-specific genes[7,21,22].In addition to its presence in embryonic and germ-derived cells,expression of OCT4 and other pluripotency markers has beenreported in cancers, adult stem cells and various adult somatictissues. The most abundant reports about OCT4 expression canbe found for hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cellsfrom umbilical cord blood and bone marrow [23\u201328]. Detectionof OCT4 transcripts in these compartments has led to a suggestionthat embryonic OCT4A may participate in maintenance ofstemness in adult stem cell compartments [29], somatic tissuecancers (bladder [30], squamous cell carcinoma [31], breastcarcinoma [32,33] and may even be expressed in normaldifferentiated tissues [34,35]. Most astoundingly, existence of truepluripotent embryonic stem-like cells in adult organs has beenproposed [23\u201325,36,37]. We have described expression of OCT4in adult human fibroblasts undergoing induction into a regener-ation competent cell type (iRC) using low oxygen culture andmedium supplementation with FGF2 [35,38,39]. iRC cells displayincreased life span, maintain normal karyotype, express a numberof stem cell genes, participate in in vivo regeneration of skeletalmuscle, but do not form tumors [39]. While we observed that theamount of OCT4 transcript does not change before and afterinduction, we at the time did not examine whether the transcriptbelonged to the OCT4A or its pseudogenes.The POU5F1 gene produces three transcripts by alternativesplicing [40,41] and three protein isoforms by alternative codonuse [42] (Figure 1). Only the OCT4A transcript contains the firstexon at its 59 sequence and only protein translated from thistranscript consequently contains the unique N-terminal transacti-vation domain that regulates DNA binding of OCT4A to targetPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/promoters. It is only this full length OCT4A - a 360 amino acidprotein - that localizes to the nucleus, binds to OCT4-regulatedpromoters, and contributes to the maintenance of pluripotencyand self-renewal [43]. OCT4A transcript and protein can bedistinguished from the non-pluripotency variants (OCT4B) usingprimers specific for 59 sequence of OCT4A mRNA and N-terminal-recognizing antibodies, respectively, as well as by theirdistinct subcellular localization [41,42,44,45].With a more recent description of OCT4 pseudogenes and theirexpression [46\u201348], however, studies examining OCT4 expressionhave to consider an additional level of complexity (Table S1,Figure S1). Eight OCT4 pseudogenes have been identified usingbioinformatics approach [47] and several of these are expressedand translated into proteins in somatic tumors, but not inembryonic carcinomas, fibroblasts or normal tissues [48\u201351].Among the OCT4 pseudogenes, OCT4-pg1, OCT4-pg3 andOCT4-pg4 pseudogenes share a high sequence homology toOCT4A and share the unique N-terminal coding sequence.Similarly, cell types isolated from umbilical cord or adult bonemarrow express OCT4-pg3, OCT4-pg4, and OCT4-pg5 but donot express embryonic OCT4A [52], and reports identifying thesetranscripts as OCT4A may have been erroneous. The only adult,non-cancer cell type that has been reported to express pseudo-genes are cells derived from peripheral blood [36]. It has beensuggested that pseudogenes may play regulatory roles in expres-sion of genes from which they originate, potentially by an RNAinterference-like mechanisms [53,54] or even as weak transcrip-tional activators [48].When studying expression of OCT4 it is therefore criticallyimportant to account for OCT4 transcripts, OCT4 pseudogenetranscripts and all the possible protein products, the majority ofwhich have no demonstrated DNA-binding activity. Whilemethods and reagents to distinguish between OCT4A andOCT4B transcripts and protein variants are available, unavail-ability of similar reagents to distinguish between embryonicOCT4A and its pseudogene transcripts and proteins remains anobstacle to studying activity of these genes in more detail. Here wedescribe unique endonuclease restriction sites within OCT4A andits pseudogenes that enable differentiation between their tran-scripts, and investigate their expression in undifferentiated anddifferentiated human cells.We demonstrate that embryonic stem cells express exclusivelyOCT4A and that during differentiation this expression ceases andis replaced by expression of pseudogenes. Similar regulation,however faster, takes place in teratocarcinoma cells. We also showthat all differentiated cell types express exclusively pseudogenes,but this expression can shift to predominantly embryonic OCT4 inadult human fibroblasts undergoing induction of regenerativecompetence (iRC) by FGF2 and low oxygen.Materials and MethodsCell CultureHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs, WA09) and inducedpluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, DF19-9-7T) were obtained,cultured, and maintained as recommended by the supplier(WiCell). For differentiation into embryonic bodies (EBs), stemcells were either trypsinized (hESCs) or mechanically dissociated(iPSCs) and plated onto low attachment culture plates indifferentiation medium consisting of DMEM-F12, 7.5% serumreplacement, 10% FBS, 0.56NEAA (Gibco), 0.005% b-mercap-toethanol (Gibco), and 2 mmol of retinoic acid (Sigma). Mediumwas changed with fresh medium twice a week. On day 5 ofdifferentiation, EBs were transferred to cell culture plates whereFigure 1.

NTERA, NCCIT (bothteratocarcinoma), HeLa, and NHSY (glioblastoma) cells wereobtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC).For differentiation, NTERA cells were seeded at density 16106cells per 75 cm2in expansion medium (DMEM +10% FBS). Afterattachment the medium was changed to differentiation mediumconsisting of DMEM +10% FBS supplemented with 0.01 mMtrans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium was changed twice a weekand samples for RNA isolation taken during 21 days post-differentiation.Other cell types or their total RNA was obtained from Lonza(human mesenchymal stem cells \u2013 hMSCs, human umbilical cordvascular endothelium - HUVEC), Clontech (testis RNA), Lonza(smooth muscle cells, and Clontech (RNA from heart). All celltypes were cultures as recommended by suppliers. Control adultprimary human fibroblasts CRL-2352 (ATCC) were cultured inDMEM-F12, 10% FBS at ambient oxygen, or in 2% oxygen in thesame medium, supplemented with 4 ng/mL of FGF2 (Pepro-Tech).Total RNA Extraction and RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).RNA integrity was examined on 1% agarose gel. 1 mg of totalRNA was reverse transcribed using QuantiTech Reverse Tran-scription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Total RNA was first treated with DNA Wipeout buffer to removepotential contamination of genomic DNA and then used forreverse transcription. The cDNA samples were stored at 220uC.The polymerase chain reaction contained 26 GoTaq GreenMastermix (Promega), 20 pmols of primers and PCR water. ThePCR primers used for PCR were: NANOG F: 59-TGTCTTCTGCTGAGATGCCTCACA-39 and R: 59-CCTTCTGCGTCACACCATTGCTAT-39; CRIPTO1 F: 59-GACGAGCAAATTCCTGATGG-39 and R: 59-GCCTCTTTTCCCCCTAATTG-39; GAPDH F: 59-ATCAC-CATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-39 and R: 59-TTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACG-39; OCT4 F, 59-GTTGATCCTCGGACCTGGCTA-39; R, 59-GGTTGCCTCTCACTCGGTTCT-39. The OCT4 primerswere designed to bind at nucleotides 142\u2013162 and 768\u2013788 ofthe coding OCT4 sequence and amplify OCT4 as well aspseudogene 1, 3 and 4 transcripts (Figure 1). PCR cyclingparameters consisted of an initial cDNA denaturation of 2 min at95uC, followed by 15 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at annealing temperature60uC, and DNA extension for 1 min at 72uC for 31 cycles. A finalextension step was performed at 72uC for 10 min and held at 4uCuntil analysis. All PCR reactions included no template controls orno RT reaction. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gelelectrophoresis and were visualized by exposure to 535 nm lighton Kodak MM4000 image analyzer.PCR Clean-upFour 25 microliter reactions were combined and PCR productcleaned using NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Briefly,PCR reactions were diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer NT andloaded on NucleoSpin Extract II column and centrifuged 1 min at11,0006g. Flow-through was discarded and column washed with700 mL of buffer NT3 and then the membrane was dried for2 min at 11,0006g. DNA was eluted into a new 1.5 mL tube andDNA concentration was determined with Nanodrop.Restriction DigestSequence alignments between OCT4A and OCT4-pg1,OCT4-pg3 and OCT4-pg4 were used to identify restriction sitesthat were then used for differentiation between the transcripts(Figure 2). A previously described ApaI restriction site specific forembryonic OCT4A [55] and three novel restriction sites forpseudogenes were selected (HinfI for OCT4-pg1; BglI for OCT4-pg3, XhoI for OCT4-pg4; all from NEBiolabs). 500 ng of PCRamplicons were digested with 12.5U ApaI, 10U XhoI, 10U BglI,or 10U HinfI. ApaI digestion reaction was incubated for 1.5 h atroom temperature and the other three for 1.5 h at 37uC. Digestedproducts were separated on 2% agarose gel with ethidiumbromide and visualized by exposure to 535 nm light on a KodakMM4000 image analyzer.Cloning and SequencingPCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPOTA Cloning Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen), were transformedinto TOPO10 competent E. coli, and were then plated onto LB-agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Antibiotic resistantcolonies were selected, expanded, and plasmid was isolated, andbi-directionally sequenced from both T3 and T7 promoters(Genewiz). Three clones were sequenced for OCT4A from ESCs,3 clones for each pseudogene from control fibroblasts and 6 clonesfor OCT4A from treated fibroblasts.Western BlottingTotal cell lysates were prepared using common procedures.Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as follows: cellswere collected using 0.05% trypsin (Cellgro) and washed twicewith PBS and pelleted. Buffer A (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPESpH8.0, 500 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,0.15 mM spermine, 0.2% Triton X-100, 7 mM 2-mercaptoeth-anol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail(Roche) was used to isolate cytoplasmic fractions. The cell pelletswere then washed with buffer B (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPESpH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplementedwith complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Buffer C(350 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mMEDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitorcocktail (Roche) was used to isolate nuclear extracts. Proteinconcentration was quantified using Bradford Protein Assay Kit(Thermo Scientific). Lysates, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionswere separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDFmembrane using Towbin\u2019s transfer buffer. Membranes wereblocked with 5% dry milk and 5% FBS in TTBS and incubatedwith primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Primary anti-human OCT4 antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal ab19857derived against the C-terminus of human OCT4, rabbit polyclonalab18976 derived against amino acids 1\u201314 (both from Abcam);and mouse monoclonal sc-5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)developed against the N-terminus. The anti-a-tubulin antibody(Sigma) was used as a loading control. Appropriate secondaryHRP-conjugated antibodies were used and signal detected byenhanced chemilluminescence (Amersham, BioRad) on KodakMM4000.ImmunocytochemistryThe same three anti-OCT4 antibodies were used for ICC: sc-5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ab19857, and ab18976 (bothfrom Abcam). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-mouse AlexaFluor568 and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568. Alexa-Fluor488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used to stainactin filaments and DAPI to stain DNA.

As expected, strongexpression of all three stem cell genes was maintained duringhESC (Figure 3A) and iPSC maintenance culture (data notshown). Starting 10 days after induction of differentiation, theexpression of these embryonic markers gradually decreased andwas undetectable for CRIPTO1 on day 14 and NANOG on day17. Low levels of OCT4 transcript, however persisted and werestill detectable on day 21 (Figure 3B). Expression of the same genesin control adult human fibroblasts resembled the expression ofthese genes in day 21 differentiated hESCs. We next examinedwhether expression of these genes can be detected in adult humanfibroblasts cultured in 2% oxygen culture in the presence of FGF2.RT-PCR amplified transcripts could be detected for all threegenes after 3 days and increased on day 7 (Figure 3C), confirmingour previously published observations [37].In addition to recognizing the OCT4A, our OCT4 primerswere designed to amplify a fragment including 59 region which iscommon for OCT4A and pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, but which ismissing in all other pseudogene transcripts and OCT4B transcripts(Figure 1). The expected 646 bp amplicon, therefore could containany of the four transcripts. This allowed us to examine the OCT4amplicon in these cells in more detail. To identify the compositionof the transcripts that could contribute to the 646 bp OCT4amplicon at any time and to distinguish between the individualtranscripts, we searched otherwise highly homologous sequences ofOCT4 and OCT4-pg1, 3 and 4 for potentially unique endonu-clease restriction sites. In addition to previously described ApaIsite, that is specific only for OCT4A [55], we were able to identifythree restriction sites that were then selected for differentiationbetween pseudogene transcripts (Figure 2). Restriction analysis ofthe amplicon from hESCs during differentiation is presented inFigure 3D. ApaI restriction analysis of the 646 bp PCR productidentified the persistence of OCT4A until day 14 of differentiation,as evident by ApaI restriction of the amplicon into 146 and 500 bpfragments. By day 17 the amplicon could not be digested by ApaIany longer. This indicated that the embryonic OCT4A transcriptwas no longer present and the entire 646 bp amplicon on day 17and after consisted of pseudogene transcripts. Digestion of theamplicon with XhoI, which digests all but the OCT4-pg4indicated very low amounts of this transcript in hESCs andstarted gradually increasing between days 10 and 14 afterdifferentiation. Digestion with BglI which cuts only OCT4-pg3(412 and 232 bp fragments) revealed a gradual increase of thistranscript 14 days after differentiation. Lastly, digestion with HinfIwhich cuts all transcripts into 5 fragments except OCT4-pg1 (4fragments) similarly indicated the start of OCT4-pg1 transcriptionon day 14 by the virtue of the longer, 424 bp fragment unique toOCT4-pg1. Overall, the amount of all pseudogene transcriptsincreased with a concomitant decease in transcription of OCT4Aover the 21 days of hESC differentiation. The pattern of OCT4Aand pseudogenes expression in control fibroblasts resembled thepattern observed in differentiated hESCs and control fibroblasts,which expressed only OCT4 pseudogenes (Figure 3E). However,ApaI digestion of the OCT4 amplicon from fibroblasts grown in2% oxygen and with 4 ng/ml FGF2\u2013 the conditions we havepreviously used to induce a phenotype switch to a regenerationcompetent cell [38] - identified embryonic OCT4A transcript atboth day 3 and day 7 of culture in these conditions, indicating areversal of expression from OCT4 pseudogenes to embryonicOCT4A (Figure 3G), resembling the pattern of ApaI digestion inhESC and iPSCs (Figure 3D and 3F). When a variety of other celltypes were examined, only hESCs and teratocarcinoma cell lines(NTERA and NCCIT) expressed ApaI-sensitive OCT4A tran-script (Figure 3H). Similar downregulation of OCT4A transcriptwas observed during differentiation of teratocarcinoma cells(Figure 4), however, simultaneous expression of pseudogenesstarted increasing much earlier during differentiation, and couldbe observed from day 5 onward.To confirm our restriction digestion results, the 646 bp PCRamplicons from hESCs, 2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts andcontrol fibroblasts were cloned into TOPO vector and three clonesfrom each sample for each pseudogene and six clones from2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts were sequenced. Sequencingconfirmed our restriction data; hESCs and 2%O2/FGF2 treatedfibroblasts expressed only embryonic OCT4A, while controlfibroblasts expressed OCT4-pg1, pg3 and pg4 (Tables S2\u2013S7).Translation and Localization of Protein Products of OCT4Gene and its PseudogenesTo determine whether any of the OCT4 transcripts were, infact, translated into detectable proteins, Western blotting wasperformed. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, the OCT4 sc-5279antibody, directed against N-terminal protein sequence, recog-nized several bands in teratocarcinoma cells (NCCIT) and infibroblasts, regardless of culture conditions. The doublet thatmigrated at 45/43 kDa (OCT4A or OCT4pg1) and a bandmigrating around 37 kDa (likely somatic OCT4B) were present inall samples, while the two faster migrating proteins (30 and20 kDa) were present only in fibroblasts gown in ambient oxygen,regardless off FGF2 supplementation. The proteins were detectedin both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of fibroblasts. Knowingthat FGF2/2%O2 fibroblasts express OCT4A, however, it isreasonable to assume that some of the slower migrating doubletrepresents embryonic OCT4A. In control fibroblasts these bandsare likely contributed by pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, as the antibodyshould recognize sequences in the N-terminal of these proteins(Figure 5A). The second antibody, ab19857 (against C-terminal),similarly recognized the doublet of 45/43 kDa and a proteinmigrating around 37 kDa, but failed to recognize any otherprotein products. The amount of detected protein at 37 kDa wassignificantly higher in cells grown in low oxygen and potentiatedby addition of FGF2 (Figure 5B). The third antibody ab18976,derived against the N-terminal OCT4 sequence could, in principledetect OCT4A and pseudogenes 1 and 3. Intensity of the band intreated fibroblast was significantly lower than in hESCs(Figure 5C). A 31 kDa band was detected in both control andtreated fibroblasts and could represent OCT4pg4. The identity ofthe 26 kDa band detected with this antibody remains unknown.An additional 19 kDa protein, that could be the product pfOCT4pg3, was recognized in control fibroblasts, but was absent instem cells and treated fibroblasts.Immunocytochemistry revealed OCT4 presence in cell nuclei ofhESCs regardless of the antibody used, as expected (Figure 6). TheN-terminal specific antibody sc-5279 recognized weak nuclearsignal in 2%O2/FGF2 fibroblasts. The C-terminal ab19857recognized nuclear localized protein in hESCs, and nuclear andcytoplasmic proteins in control and treated fibroblasts. As none ofthe OCT4B variants localize to the nucleus, the nuclear signal canExpression of OCT4 and Its PseudogenesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546be contributed only by OCT4A or pseudogene OCT4-pg1derived protein [48,51]. Considering the individual cell typetranscript profile, it is possible that in treated fibroblasts theantibody recognized OCT4A. The OCT4-pg4 protein has yet tobe detected by any anti-OCT4 antibody, and OCT4-pg3 localizesto the cytoplasm [51]. The sc-8629, another C-terminal specificantibody, recognized nuclear OCT4A in hESCs and cytoplasmicproteins in both control and treated fibroblasts. Cytoplasmicstaining in both fibroblasts may be identifying OCT4A, OCT4B,OCT4pg1 [42], and/or OCT4-pg3 [51]. These data corroborateour previously published results [35] and indicate that expressionof OCT4 in somatic cells is under the control of an oxygen andFGF2-sensitive mechanism.DiscussionOCT4 has received considerable attention during the past yearsand its expression has been reported in various cell types andacross a spectrum of differentiation cell states. Due to thepossibility of multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms, aswell as expressed pseudogenes being detected, more rigorousanalyses of OCT4 are required [44,46]. Existence of high numberof pseudogenes for OCT4 is not an exception. Excessive frequencyof pseudogenes for embryonic stem cells-specific genes was alsodescribed for Nanog (10 pseudogenes), Stella (16 pseudogenes),and Cripto-1 (6 pseudogenes) [47,52].We identified expression of Oct-4pg1, Oct-4pg3 and Oct-4pg4pseudogenes in normal adult human fibroblasts using PCR basedapproach followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion andsequencing. Our study confirms that expression of OCT4Aprotein is exclusive to hESCs and germ cell-derived tumor cellFigure 3. RT-PCR for expression of embryonic stem cell specific genes.

None of the other examined somatic cells, somatic tumor celllines or adult stem cells expressed OCT4A. In an exact oppositepattern, all cell types examined except hESCs and germ celltumor-derived cell lines expressed pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4.Monitoring the relationship between OCT4A expression andexpression of pseudogenes in hESCs during differentiation, aninteresting pattern emerges; a gradual decrease of OCT4A occursin a parallel with an increase in expression of pseudogenes. Thismay indicate a tight regulatory relationship between OCT4A andits pseudogenes, even though the OCT4 gene and all thepseudogenes are located on different chromosomes [47]. One ofthe pseudogenes, namely OCT4-pg3 is located within the 445 kbof NANOG, STELLA and GDF3 locus on chromosome 12 [56],significance of which still needs to be examined.It is interesting that similar changes occur in reverse duringacquisition of regeneration competence in adult human fibroblasts.After a short term culture in reduced oxygen and supplementationwith FGF2 [35,38] human fibroblast cease expressing OCT4pseudogenes in favor of OCT4A. We have reported previouslythat these cells do not acquire the pluripotent phenotype [35], butrather undergo a phenotype switch that demonstrates regenerationcompetence in vivo [38]. Cells demonstrate an increased life span,doubled population doubling capacity, maintain a normalkaryotype and do not form tumors in SCID mice. They do,however, demonstrate long term engraftment and acquire PAX7positive phenotype when transplanted into a skeletal muscle defectin mice [38]. Significance and relevance of OCT4A expression, ifany, during acquisition of regeneration competence, is not clearand is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, this is the firststudy in which a switch from pseudogene to OCT4A expressionhas been reported and induced by selective manipulation ofculture conditions. We speculate that pseudogene silencing isinduced in adult somatic cells using our culture system, an eventthat may be required for re-activation of OCT4A. While clearlynot pluripotent, regeneration-competent cells express low levels ofOCT4A. It has been shown that OCT4 is controlling pluripotencyin a quantitative manner [57]. Specifically, high level of OCT4expression drives ES cells to endoderm and mesoderm lineages,while stem cells with low level of OCT4 differentiate intotrophoectoderm. Only a specific level of OCT4 can maintainstem cells in a pluripotent state. These observations suggest thatOCT4 is different from many known transcription regulators thatappear to function in an on-off manner. Consequently, low levelsof embryonic OCT4A may not be functionally relevant for eitherinduction or maintenance of pluripotency, but may be relevant forinduction of this novel regeneration-competent cell phenotype.Our data indicate that chromatin plasticity may be an inherentfeature of adult fibroblasts and that the manifestation of thisplasticity may be influenced by the extracellular environment. Ourdata also support the notion that regeneration competence doesnot depend on cell pluripotency and may be regulated by a novel,OCT4A-dependent mechanism. OCT4 gene ablation in stem cellFigure 4.

Neither OCT4 nor itspseudogenes, for example, are required for multipotency of humanstromal cells from different tissues [49]. There is no commonregulatory network that has been shown to exist between thevarious somatic stem cell types and that can be compared to generegulatory network that maintains pluripotency in ES cells withOCT4 as its cornerstone [52,58]. It is more likely thatFigure 5. Protein expression of stem cell specific genes.

Complete cell lysates or nuclear and cytoplasmicfractions (N and C, respectively) were separated on 10% SDS PAGE, transferred to PVDF and blotted with different antibodies.

Misidentification of OCT4 insomatic tissues and cancer cell lines can also result from detectionof pseudogene transcripts by RT-PCR and/or nuclear detection ofpseudogene proteins by ICC. Most studies indeed do not excludethe possibilities of pseudogene expression [16,44,46,59] and do notdistinguish between OCT4 isoforms [46]. All OCT4 proteinisoforms are identical in their C-terminal region and distinct in N-terminal region so the location of the epitope recognized by anyanti-OCT4 antibody should be considered first [42,46] andcombined with a diligent analysis of the OCT4 transcript. Addingthe possibility that OCT4 pseudogenes translate into proteins andthat OCT4-pg1 can localize to the nucleus [51] and confertranscriptional activation of some reporter gene constructs [48],diligent analysis should be employed. This may likely require acombination of experimental approaches, such as RT-PCR,restriction analysis for various pseudogenes, and protein analysis.Additional functional studies, such as chromatin immunoprecip-itation, electromobility shift assay and/or transcription analysis ofdownstream genes may need to be included to reach a validconclusion.Besides accurately characterizing OCT4 expression, relevanceof OCT4 expression should be considered for each chosenexperimental system. While OCT4A expression may be criticallyimportant when studying pluripotency and self-renewal, examin-ing expression of OCT4A in studies involving stem cells from adultcompartments or in somatic cell cancers may be of little functionalrelevance [59,60].Supporting InformationFigure S1 Differences between Oct4 pseudogenes basedon the coding sequences.
