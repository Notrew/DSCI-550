Tel.: +82 43 229E-mail address: parkks@cju.ac.kra b s t r a c tObesity is closely associated with a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation characterized by abnormalcytokine production and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose tissue. Tumor necrosisfactor (TNF)-a is chronically elevated in adipose tissues of obese rodents and humans. Increased levels ofTNF-a are implicated in the induction of atherogenic adipokines, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI)-1, adipose-tissue-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6. Aucu-bin, an iridoid glycoside existing in medicinal plants, has been reported to show an anti-inflammatoryactivity by suppression of TNF-a production in murine macrophages. The present study is aimed to inves-tigate the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced atherogenic changes of the adipokines in differentiated3T3-L1 cells. Aucubin significantly inhibited TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA synthesis of the athero-genic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6. Further investigation of the molecular mechanismrevealed that pretreatment with aucubin suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activa-tion, inhibitory kappa Ba (IjBa) degradation, and subsequent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) activation.These findings suggest that aucubin may improve obesity-induced atherosclerosis by attenuating TNF-a-induced inflammatory responses.\ufffd 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionObesity, which is characterized by excessive accumulation ofabdominal fat, is casually associated with the premature develop-ment of atherosclerosis, increased risk of stroke, and developmentof congestive heart failure [1]. Recent studies have indicated thatthe adipocyte secretes a variety of adipokines involved in energymetabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular functions [2]. Thecellular mechanisms linking obesity and atherosclerosis are com-plex and have not been fully elucidated. However, increasing evi-dences suggest that the changes of adipokines including PAI-1,MCP-1, and IL-6 due to excess adipose tissue may be a cause of ath-erosclerosis [3].Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is the primary inhibitorof plasminogen activation. Plasma levels of PAI-1 are markedly ele-vated in obese individuals as well as in patients with insulin resis-tance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [4,5]. PAI-1 is thought to be the link between obesity and increased risk forCVDs [6]. Although several tissues are known to produce PAI-1,ll rights reserved.llege of Natural Science and, Sangdang-gu, Cheongju-si,8566; fax: +82 43 229 8559.adipose tissue appears to be the major contributor to elevatedPAI-1 levels observed in cases of obesity [7,8]. Monocyte chemoat-tractant protein (MCP)-1 chemotactically recruits monocytes tosites of inflammation. Although this protein is traditionallythought to be expressed mainly endothelial cells and macrophages,it has been shown to be primarily expressed by adipose tissues[9,10]. Adipocyte-derived MCP-1 induces macrophage infiltrationinto adipose tissues and thus secretes inflammatory cytokinesincluding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which in turn leads tothe dysfunction of adipocytes [11]. In addition, MCP-1 inhibitsinsulin-dependent glucose uptake and the expression of adipo-genic genes [10].Aucubin is a natural constituent with a monoterpene cyclic ringsystem found in a wide range of some insects and higher plantssuch as Aucuba japonica and Plantago asiatica [12,13]. In recentyears, a variety of bio-activities of aucubin have been reported; li-ver-protective activities against hepato-toxicants, stimulation ofbile acid excretion, anti-microbial activities, anti-tumor activities,antidotal activities for noxious amanita mushroom poisoning,anti-viral activities against hepatitis B virus, and anti-inflamma-tory activities [14\u201322]. Interestingly, a number of plants containingaucubin have been used long as medicinal herbs for anti-inflam-matics and anti-rheumatics in Oriental and Occidental hemi-spheres. As for the molecular mechanism for anti-inflammatoryhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005mailto:parkks@cju.ac.krhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine408 K.S. Park / Cytokine 62 (2013) 407\u2013412activities of aucubin, it was reported that aucubin inhibits the pro-duction of TNF-a resulting from the both IjBa degradation and thenuclear translocation of NF-jB in RAW 264.7 cells [21]. However,the inhibitory effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced inflammatoryresponses in adipocytes have not been reported previously.The present study was designed to determine whether it atten-uates TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA production of the ath-erogenic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 indifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, the possible mecha-nisms for inhibitory effects of aucubin on obesity-related inflam-matory responses were examined.Fig. 1. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-stimulated adipokine production in 3T3-L1adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed or not to increasing concentrations ofaucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h and then were stimulated for 24 h by theaddition of 10 ng/mL TNF-a. The secreted antigens of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 inconditioned medium were measured as described in Section 2. Results representthe mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ##p < 0.01 versus untreatedcontrol; \ufffdp < 0.05, \ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-stimulated control.2. Materials and methods2.1. ReagentsAucubin with 99.5% purity was purchased from Wako PureChemical Industries Ltd., (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant murine tu-mor necrosis factor (TNF)-a was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,MN, USA). Insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxan-thine were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All tissue culture mate-rials were from Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD, USA). Primary anti-mouseantibodies for extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), phos-pho-ERK, IjBa, phospho-IjBa, and b-actin were obtained from CellSignaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Poly (ADP-ribose) poly-merase (PARP) and p65 monoclonal antibodies were purchasedfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).2.2. 3T3-L1 cell culture and treatment3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Rock-ville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium(DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) penicil-lin\u2013streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10,000 cg/mL strep-tomycin in 0.85% saline), and 1% (v/v) 100 lM pyruvate at 37 \ufffdCin 95% air 10% CO2. Differentiation of 2-day postconfluent preadi-pocytes (designated as day 0) was initiated with 0.5 mM 3-isobu-tyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 lM dexamethasone, and 1 lg/mL insulinin DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h(day 2), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supple-mented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 lg/mL insulin, andthe cells were then fed every other day with DMEM containing10% fetal bovine serum. Aucubin was reconstituted, filter sterilized,and stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. For each experiment, cells received aucubinpremixed with culture medium. TNF-a treatment was carried outafter a 6-h pretreatment with aucubin. Aucubin was dissolved indimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before it was added to culture medium.The final concentration of DMSO in culture medium was 0.5% (v/v).2.3. Measurement of adipokines by ELISAThe conditioned culture medium from 3T3-L1 adipocytes wascollected from each sample. The concentrations of MCP-1, PAI-1,and IL-6 were assayed using a mouse MCP-1 ELISA kit (R&D Sys-tems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a mouse PAI-1 ELISA kit (MolecularInnovations Inc., Southfield, MI, USA), and a mouse IL-6 ELISA kit(Biosource Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA), respectively. All assays wereperformed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.2.4. Evaluation of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCRFor real-time RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 lg total RNAin a final reaction volume of 15 lL. Real-time RT-PCR was per-formed using 2 lL cDNA diluted with each of the gene-specific pri-mer sets (Bioneer Inc., Korea). Each primer set was used at aconcentration of 150 nM in a final reaction volume of 20 lL andreactions were performed on the Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green IMaster (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The sequences forprimers are: MCP-1 (50-GCCCCACTCACCTGCTGCTACT-30 and 50-CCTGCTGCTGGTGATCCTCTTGT-30), PAI-1 (50-AGGATCGAGGT-AAACGAGAGC-30 and 50-GCGGGCTGAGATGACAAA-30), and IL-6(50-GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA-30 and 50-CCAGGTAGCTA-TGGTACTCCAGAA-30). Levels of mRNA, expressed as relative mRNAlevels compared with control, were calculated after normalizationto b-actin.2.5. Nuclear extractionNuclear fractions of cells were prepared as previously described[23]. Briefly, cells were scraped and suspended in 400 lL of coldbuffer A (HEPES 10 mM; pH 7.9; KCl 10 mM; EDTA 0.1 mM; EGTA0.1 mM; dithiothreitol 1 mM; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride0.5 mM; pepstatin A 1 lg/mL; leupeptin 10 lg/mL; aprotininFig. 2.

Density ratios versus PARP were determined bydensitometry. The data shown are representative of three independent experi-ments. The values shown are means \u00b1 SD. ##p < 0.01 versus untreated control;\ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-only treated control.2.6. Western blot analysisCell lysates were collected, and then protein concentrationswere determined with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay re-agents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amountsof cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes(Whatman Protran, Whatman GmBH, Dassel, Germany). Afterbeing blocked at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk withTris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) buffer for 2 h, the blots wereprobed with the primary antibody against each target protein at aconcentration of 1:500\u20131:1000 in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBSTovernight at 4 \ufffdC. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradishperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and signals were de-tected and quantified using a chemiluminescent detection system,LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Japan).2.7. StatisticsData expressed as mean \u00b1 SD were obtained from three separateexperiments. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. P < 0.05 wasconsidered to have significant difference.3. Results3.1. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced secretion of adipokines in3T3-L1 adipocytesTo examine the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced secretionof adipokines, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with variousconcentrations of aucubin for 6 h and then incubated with 10 ng/mL TNF-a for 24 h. After incubation, conditioned medium was col-lected for ELISA assay. Treatment with aucubin inhibited TNF-a-in-duced increase in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 in dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 8.20, 9.94, and 6.85 lM, respec-tively (Fig. 1).Fig. 4.

Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokinegenes in 3T3-L1 adipocytesTo investigate whether aucubin inhibited TNF-a-induced secre-tion of adipokines by altering the gene expression, real-time quan-titative RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA extracted from 3T3-L1 adipocytes of each group. The gene expression of adipokineswas measured after 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to aucubinfor 6 h prior to TNF-a (10 ng/mL) treatment for 24 h. The enhancedproduction of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 mRNA by TNF-a was sup-pressed by aucubin pretreatment (Fig. 2). At a aucubin concentra-tion of 10 lM, the mRNA production of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 wassuppressed by 36.5%, 24.3%, and 39.0%, respectively.3.3. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced nuclear translocation ofNF-jBSince NF-jB is a major transcription factor that modulates theexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it was investigatedwhether aucubin prevents the translocation of the p65 subunit ofNF-jB from cytosol into the nucleus using Western blotting. Itwas found that aucubin prior to TNF-a significantly attenuatedp65 level in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3).3.4. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of IjBaand ERKIn unstimulated adipocytes, NF-jB is sequested in the cytosolby its inhibitor IjBa, and when cells are stimulated with TNF-a,IjB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded via26S proteasome, which results in the release of NF-jB. Therefore,the effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation anddegradation of IjBa was examined using Western blotting. Aucu-bin significantly reduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylationin a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, aucubin pretreatmentblocked TNF-a-induced IjBa degradation (Fig. 4A). Next, the ef-fects of ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 (PD) on TNF-a-inducedIjBa phosphorylation and degradation were investigated. In paral-lel with the effects of aucubin, pretreatment with 20 lM PD98059reduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylation and degradationin adipocytes (Fig. 4A). These observations suggest that the phos-phorylation and degradation of IjBa is affected by ERK1/2 signalpathway. In fact, it has been known that activation of IjBa degra-dation is a downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway [24]. Thus, it was investigated whether aucubin regu-lates the phosphorylation of ERK using Western blotting. Challengewith TNF-a brought about the ERK phosphorylation within 15 min;then p-ERK band was gradually restored to basal level (Fig. 4B).Therefore, Western blotting for ERK was carried out after treatingwith TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min in the presence or absence ofaucubin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with aucubin in theindicated concentrations for 6 h and then stimulated with TNF-a(10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Total cell lysates were then probed withphosphospecific antibodies for ERK1/2. The phosphorylation ofERK1/2 was increased in cells treated with TNF-a alone. However,aucubin significantly inhibited phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels inTNF-a-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a concentration-dependentmanner (Fig. 4C).4. DiscussionsAucubin [1,4a,5,7a-tetra-5-hydroxy-7-(hydroxymethyl)cyclo-penta(c)pyran-1-yl-b-D-glucopyranoside] is a common iridoid gly-coside, found in a wide range of plants, which are used in folkmedicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Those medicinal plantscontaining aucubin show a variety of biological activities as afore-mentioned. Of pharmaceutical products as well as dietary supple-ments containing such medicinal plant materials, agents fortreating inflammatory ailments including rheumatic inflammationhave been marketed and used for long time. As for the molecularmechanism for anti-inflammatory activities of aucubin, it was re-ported that aucubin inhibits the production of TNF-a resultingfrom the both IjBa degradation and the nuclear translocation ofNF-jB in RAW 264.7 cells [21].It was previously reported that the increased levels of TNF-aassociated with obesity may significantly contribute to elevatedplasma and adipose tissue expression levels of adipokines [25].This study demonstrated that aucubin effectively inhibited TNF-a-stimulated increases in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). The mRNA production of each adipo-kines was suppressed in parallel with its secretion regulated byaucubin (Fig. 2).Transcription factor NF-jB has been evidenced to play a majorrole in the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokines in adipocytes[26]. NF-jB is associated and controlled by IjBa, which presentsan inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, IjBa be-comes phosphorylated, undergoes degradation, and allows NF-jBtranslocation into the nucleus, where it activates proinflammatorygenes and participates in the inflammatory response [27]. In thepresent study, aucubin suppressed the nuclear translocation ofNF-jB (Fig. 3), which suggests that aucubin may decrease NF-jBactivity by inhibition of IjBa degradation. Furthermore, it revealedthat ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 blocked degradation ofIjBa upon TNF-a stimulation, implying that IjBa degradation isa downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/2 path-way (Fig. 4A). Therefore, to confirm the inhibitory mechanisms ofIjBa degradation by aucubin, the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-in-duced ERK phosphorylation were investigated. It was found thataucubin exhibited significant inhibition on TNF-a-stimulatedERK1/2 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent fashion(Fig. 4C).In conclusion, aucubin can attenuate TNF-a-stimulated in-creases in gene expression and secretion of adipokines in 3T3-L1adipocytes. The effects of aucubin were mediated by suppressionof ERK phosphorylation, IjBa degradation, and subsequent NF-jB activation. The present study may contribute to the under-standing of anti-inflammatory effects of aucubin and provide a no-vel mechanism of aucubin in preventing obesity-relatedpathologies.References[1] Douketis JD, Sharma AM.
