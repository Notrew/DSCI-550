Here, we report that ERRc directly regulates CREBH gene expression inresponse to ER stress. ERRc bound to the ERRc response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERRc byadenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown ofERRc or inhibition of ERRc by ERRc specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction ofCREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1a was required for ERRc mediated induction of the CREBH gene asdemonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERRc and PGC1a on the CREBHpromoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERRc and PGC1a binding site.Moreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese condition significantly increased CRP geneexpression, and this increase was significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear receptorERRc directly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.Citation: Misra J, Chanda D, Kim D-K, Cho S-R, Koo S-H, et al.

These orphan nuclear receptors regulate transcription viaERREs but do not bind endogenous estrogen [1]. The ERRs arenamed due to the conservation in the structure of their DNA-binding domains/DBDs with the highly homologous EstrogenReceptor [2]. Crystallographic studies indicate that the ERRsalong with ERRc are constitutively active without a naturalligand, while several synthetic ligands either stimulate or repressthe activity of ERRc by promoting or disrupting ERR\u2013coactivatorinteractions [3]. Among them GSK5182, a 4-hydroxy tamoxifenanalogue, is a selective inverse agonist of ERRc and directly bindsto the ligand binding domain and inhibits transactivation byERRc [4\u20138]. ERRc is primarily expressed in heart, brain, kidney,pancreas and liver tissues [3]. We previously reported that hepaticERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by directly binding to thePhosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) promoters along with coactivator PGC-1a[5]. Previous results from our laboratory also demonstrated thatERRc directly binds to the LIPIN1 promoter along withcoactivator PGC-1a to regulate LIPIN1 gene expression, andinhibits hepatic insulin signaling [6]. ERRc also controls hepaticCB1 receptor-mediated CYP2E1 expression at the transcriptionallevel and thus contributes to the oxidative liver injury by alcohol[7]. Finally, hypoxia induces PDK4 gene expression throughinduction of ERRc [8]. The transcriptional activity of the ERRfamily is dependent on interactions with coactivators, in particularPGC-1a and PGC-1b [9]. ERRa and ERRc regulate mitochon-drial programs involved in oxidative phosphorylation and anuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinatesthe postnatal metabolic transition in the heart [9]. Though allthese reports clearly suggest a key role of ERRc in differentcellular processes, its role in ER stress is yet to be determined.ER stress is a state associated with perturbation of ERhomeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteinsin the ER [10]. CREBH, an ER-stress-activated liver enrichedtranscription factor, has been previously reported to transcrip-PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342tionally activate acute phase response genes in the liver in responseto lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokinesinterleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) [11].Recently, CREBH has been demonstrated to play a critical role inER-stress-mediated regulation of iron metabolism via induction ofhepcidin (Hamp) gene expression, in triglyceride metabolism andhepatic lipogenesis, and in the mediation of the hormonalregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under fasting or insulin-resistant conditions [12\u201315], thereby underlining the importanceof CREBH in various hepatic metabolic pathways. Recent studiesfrom our group have demonstrated that activation of Cb1r leads tophosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signalingpathway which in turn activates CREBH. This Cb1r-JNK-CREBH pathway was further demonstrated to regulate hepaticgluconeogenesis by regulating key gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK,and G6Pase) and lipid metabolism by regulating Lipin1 [16\u201317].Our group has also reported that hepatic cannabinoid receptortype 1 mediates alcohol-induced regulation of bile acid enzymegenes (CYP7A1, and CYP27A1) expression via CREBH [18].PGC-1a, a member of a small family of coactivators, wasidentified using yeast two hybrid assays for PPARc-interactingproteins [19] and is implicated in mitochondrial metabolism,thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, adipocyte differentia-tion, gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake [20\u201321]. PGC-1a targetspromoters by interacting directly with numerous DNA bindingtranscription factors and then coordinating several biochemicalevents, including recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymessuch as p300/CBP and SRC-1, interaction with the basaltranscription machinery and linking of transcription to RNAsplicing [22].C-reactive protein (CRP) in comparison to other inflammationmarkers is a relatively stable, robust and an exquisitely sensitiveserum protein. In some studies, CRP level in plasma predictscardiovascular events even better than low-density lipoproteincholesterol level [23]. Multiple epidemiological and mechanisticstudies have shown that CRP is not just a marker but rather anactive mediator for endothelial dysfunction, arterial thrombosisand atherogenesis [24\u201325]. CRP, as an inflammatory cytokine, isprimarily synthesized in liver and regulated in response tointerleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [26\u201328]. Hepato-cytes are believed to be the major contributor of circulating CRPin plasma. Therefore, hepatic CRP is able to cause liver per sedamage and inflammation, and plays a key role in thedevelopment of atherosclerosis when entering into the bloodcirculation. In hepatoma cell lines, the endogenous CRP gene iseither dysregulated or weakly active [29]. However, plasma levelsof CRP may rise rapidly and markedly (.1000 fold) after an acuteinflammation in human [30].Here, we examined the mechanism of how nuclear receptor,ERRc regulates ER bound bZIP transcription factor, CREBHunder the conditions of ER stress. Upon ER stress, expression ofboth transcription factors increases significantly. ERRc directlybinds to the CREBH promoter. Of interest, PGC1a acts as acoactivator for ERRc. We observed a significant increase inhistone H3 and H4 acetylation in CREBH promoters uponinduction of ER stress by tunicamycin (Tm) treatment. Knock-down of ERRc significantly decreases the expression of CREBHFigure 1. ERRc induces CREBH gene. (A,B), AML12 cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-ERRc for 24 hr.

In addition, the nuclear receptors GR, PPARa,and HNF4a regulate transcription of the ER bound transcriptionfactor CREBH [15,36\u201337]. We demonstrated previously thatERRc regulates ATF6a in response to ER stress [38]. Toinvestigate whether ERRc regulates CREBH, which belongs tothe same CREB3 family as ATF6 and is structurally related to it,ERRc was overexpressed by Ad-ERRc in AML12 cells. Interest-ingly, CREBH mRNA level, as determined by qPCR, increasedmore than six-fold after ERRc overexpression (Fig. 1A). CREBHprotein level, as determined by Western blot, also increased underthe same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Next, to checkwhether CREBH gene induction was ERRc specific, ERRa wasoverexpressed in AML12 cells by adenovirus. No significantchange in CREBH protein level was observed after ERRaoverexpression, suggesting that CREBH gene induction is ERRcspecific (Fig. 1C). To verify these in vitro results, mice were infectedwith Ad-ERRc by tail vein injection. Consistent with the in vitroresults, an almost fivefold increase in CREBH mRNA level wasobserved. A significant increase in CREBH-N (active form) proteinlevel was also observed in vivo (Fig. 1D and 1E). As observed in themouse cell lines, we noticed a similar effect of ERRc overexpres-sion in HepG2 cells. ERRc overexpression significantly increasedCREBH mRNA, and protein levels (Fig. 1F and G), indicatingFigure 4. ERRc regulates CREBH target gene.

Collectively theseresults demonstrate that ERRc positively regulates CREBH geneexpression.ER Stress Induces CREBH Gene Expression via ERRcNext, we ascertained the molecular mechanism of ERRc-mediated CREBH gene induction. A transient transfection assaywas performed with the ERRc expression vector and the mouseand human CREBH promoter- driven luciferase reporter gene(Fig. 2A, and B). ERRc significantly enhanced both mouse andhuman CREBH promoter activity. It was reported previously thattunicamycin (Tm) induces CREBH and ERRc gene expression[11,38]. To investigate whether Tm mediated activation of theCREBH promoter depends on ERRc, a transient transfectionassay was performed with the mouse CREBH promoter-drivenluciferase reporter gene. Tm treatment significantly increasedCREBH promoter activity but activation was severely compro-mised when endogenous ERRc was knocked down (Fig. 2C).Next, AML12 cells were treated with Tm or infected with Ad-shERRc to knockdown endogenous ERRc to observe the effect ofERRc knockdown on CREBH gene expression. As expected,knockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly suppressed the Tm-mediated increase in CREBH mRNA level (Fig. 2D). Next, weperformed Western blot analyses to check the CREBH-N proteinlevel under the same experimental conditions. In agreement withthe mRNA level, CREBH-N protein level also decreasedsignificantly in response to Ad-shERRc infection (Fig. 2E) inAML12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate thatERRc mediates the induction of CREBH gene expression by ERstress.ERRc Activates CREBH Gene Promoter via an ERREPGC1a acts as an ERRc coactivator [6]. To test whetherPGC1a and ERRc together play any role in the induction ofCREBH, transient transfection assays were performed with themouse CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene andERRc and PGC1a expression vectors. ERRc significantlyincreased CREBH promoter activity, and this activity was furtheraugmented in the presence of PGC1a (Fig. 3A). A series ofdeletion constructs was analyzed to identify the DNA sequenceconferring the ERRc-mediated ER stress effect on the CREBHpromoter. Deletion of the CREBH promoter sequence from0.2 kb to 0.1 kb drastically decreased the promoter activityconferred by ERRc, suggesting that the region from 0.2 kb to0.1 kb confers activation of the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3B). It wasreported previously that ERRc binds to a consensus sequenceAGGTCA [38]. We aligned this sequence with the CREBHpromoter region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb and found a perfect matchto the consensus sequence, AGGTCA, spanning the 0.2 kb to0.1 kb region. Transient transfection assays were performed usingwild-type and AGGTCA mutant CREBH promoters with theERRc expression vector to test whether AGGTCA is critical forERRc binding. This mutant reporter did not show any significantresponse to ERRc cotransfection (Fig. 3C). Next, the ChIP assaywas performed to monitor the effect of Tm on ERRc and PGC1arecruitment to the endogenous CREBH gene promoter. Underbasal conditions, both ERRc and PGC1a occupied the CREBHpromoter. However, Tm treatment significantly augmented ERRcand PGC1a occupancy on the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3D). TheChIP assay results provide critical in vivo evidence that the ER-stress-ERRc-PGC1a signaling pathway increases CREBH genetranscription. Gene activation is often associated with increasedhistone acetylation [39], and the ChIP assay was performed todetermine whether Tm treatment results in increased template-associated histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation of the CREBHgene promoter in AML12 cells (Fig. 3E). Tm treatment andadenoviral overexpression of ERRc and/or PGC1a increasedacetylation of H3 (Ac\u2013H3) and H4 (Ac\u2013H4) on the ERRc-responsive region of the CREBH promoter, whereas knockdownof endogenous ERRc or PGC1a significantly reduced histone (H3and/or H4) acetylation. We observed a synergistic effect of ERRcand PGC1a overexpression on acetylation of H3 (Ac\u2013H3) and H4(Ac\u2013H4) (Fig. 3E) which was in accordance with our previousresults (Fig. 3A) where, synergistic effect on CREBH promoteractivation was clearly observed by cotransfection of ERRc andPGC1a with CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene.Overall, these results demonstrate that ER stress augments thebinding of ERRc and PGC1a to the CREBH promoter andincreases template-associated histone (H3 and H4) acetylation tofacilitate CREBH gene transcription.Effect of ERRc Knockdown on CREBH-mediatedRegulation of CRP Gene ExpressionNext, we examined regulation of CREBH target genes. Ourresults (Figs. 1\u20133) demonstrate that ERRc regulates CREBH geneFigure 5.

CRP is a well-known markerof various human diseases and is regulated by CREBH in responseto ER stress [11]. We examined the effect of ERRc knockdown onTm mediated CRP promoter activation by transient transfectionassay in 293T cells to verify the effect of ERRc on CREBH targetgene (Fig. 4A). Both Tm treatment and ERRc overexpressionsignificantly increased CRP promoter activation. However,knockdown of endogenous ERRc or CREBH significantly bluntedthe increase in CRP promoter activation by Tm. These resultsdemonstrate that Tm-induced CRP promoter activation ismediated through ERRc. Next, ERRc was overexpressed inAML12 cells to confirm the effect of ERRc on CRP geneexpression (Fig. 4B). As expected, ERRc overexpression signifi-cantly increased both CRP mRNA and protein levels, and thisincrease was significantly attenuated upon endogenous CREBHknockdown. This result indicates that ERRc regulates CRP geneexpression through CREBH. Endogenous ERRc was knockeddown in AML12 cells for further verification. In agreement withthe previous results, we observed that the Tm-mediated increase inCRP mRNA and protein was substantially reduced after ERRcknockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we demonstrated thatERRc induces CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself.Alcohol Feeding and Diabetic Obesity Induce HepaticCREBH and CRP Gene Expression via Hepatic ERRcOur results (Figs. 1\u20134) demonstrate that ER stress inducesCREBH and CRP gene expression through ERRc in vitro.GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRc [4\u20138] that specificallybinds to ERRc and inhibits ERRc transcriptional activity, wasused to verify this effect in vivo. As expected from previous results,we noticed that GSK5182 treatment substantially reduced Tm-induced CREBH-N and CRP protein levels in mouse liver(Fig. 5A). Moreover, ERRc protein levels were decreased uponTm+GSK treatment as compared to Tm alone. This might be dueto the mechanism of autoregulatory feed forward loop thatregulates ERRc gene expression [38]. Previous reports from ourlaboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol consumption induceshepatic ERRc gene expression [8]. Mice were treated with EtOHto investigate whether ERRc induces CREBH-N and CRP geneexpression. The EtOH treatment significantly increased CREBH-N and CRP gene expression, along with ERRc. However,GSK5182 strongly inhibited both basal and alcohol-inducedhepatic CREBH-N, and CRP protein expression in mice liver(Fig. 5B). Our laboratory reported previously that the diabeticobese condition (db/db mice), induces ERRc gene expression [6].A significant induction in CREBH-N and CRP protein levels wereobserved under the same conditions. However, we observed thatGSK5182 treatment substantially suppressed both CREBHN, andCRP protein levels in db/db mice liver in accordance with previousresults (Fig. 5C). Overall, we demonstrated that ERRc regulatesCREBH gene expression in vitro and in vivo.DiscussionER stress activates the unfolded protein response to generatemultiple transcription factors that function in different cellularphenomena including chromatin remodeling [40\u201344]. Our resultsprovide direct evidence for a newly recognized function of ERRcduring transcriptional regulation of CREBH in response to ERstress, as well as in diabetic obese condition [38,11]. Thecoactivator PGC1a plays a crucial role in this regulation.Moreover, chromatin remodeling during subsequent transcriptionevents was observed and provided a mechanistic basis for theERRc-mediated induction of CREBH under different physiolog-ical conditions.We reported previously that ERRc directly regulates ATF6a,an ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor, in response toER stress [38]. CREBH is also an ER membrane-bound bZIPtranscription factor that belongs to the same CREB3 family asATF6a [11]. Moreover, we reported an increase in CREBHmRNA level following ERRc overexpression, although not asmuch as that of ATF6a [38]. Hence, we investigated the role ofERRc in the regulation of ER-bound transcription factor CREBHunder different physiological conditions including ER stress. Weobserved significant enhancement of CREBH gene expression byoverexpressing ERRc in vitro and in vivo. A six-fold increase inCREBH mRNA level was noticed along with a significant increasein the CREBH-N form in response to ERRc overexpression(Fig. 1). CREBH is regulated by nuclear receptor PPARa,HNF4a, and GR [36\u201337,15]; hence, our current findings furtherestablish the interconnection between nuclear receptors and ERmembrane-bound transcription factors.According to previous reports, ER stress activates both CREBHand ERRc gene expression [11,38]. As we observed CREBH geneinduction by ERRc (Fig. 1), we speculated that ERRc might beinvolved in ER stressmediated induction of CREBH. In fact,knockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly reduced ER stress-induced CREBH mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2), furthersupporting the ER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. It has beenreported that ERRc activates target genes by directly binding tothe ERRE on the promoter of the target gene [38]. This led us tospeculate the presence of ERRE on the CREBH promoter, andwe identified a potential site (AGGTCA) on the CREBH promoterfor ERRc binding. The ChIP assay provided further crucialevidence and confirmed ERRc binding on the CREBH promoterunder ER stress. PGC1a is closely associated with ERRctranscriptional activity [3]. Several lines of evidence have shownthat the transcriptional regulation of PDK4 expression by PGC1ais mediated by ERRa or ERRc [45]. In accordance with theseprevious reports, occupancy of PGC1a on ERRE of the CREBHpromoter was observed during ER stress, providing critical in vivoevidence indicating that PGC1a is a coactivator for ERRc. Generepression is often associated with decreased histone acetylation[39]. Chromatin remodeling also occurs during coactivator genetranscription [46]. In agreement with previous reports, asignificant increase in template-associated histone, H3, and H4acetylation was noticed (H3 and H4) at the ERRE on CREBHpromoter following Tm treatment or ERRc overexpression,showing the importance of chromatin remodeling during genetranscription (Fig. 3). Overall, our findings reveal a novelmolecular mechanism employed by ERRc linking transactivationof ERRc [38] to CREBH gene expression. Along with pastindications of a probable nuclear receptor/ER membrane-boundtranscription factor interconnection, these data raise the possibility(discussed further below) that ERRc may serve as a key mediatorin ER stress-induced CREBH gene expression.CRP, a known marker for several pathological conditionsincluding ER stress, is regulated by CREBH [11]. Besides being amarker, CRP is an active mediator of endothelial dysfunction,arterial thrombosis, and atherogenesis [24\u201325]. Numerous groupshave shown pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of CRPin vitro [25,47\u201348]. Transgenic expression of human CRPsuppresses endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression andbioactivity following vascular injury [49]. Several lines of evidencesuggest that CRP is a modulator that drives direct biological effectson vascular cells. CRP, at concentrations known to predict adversevascular events, directly quenches the production of the NO, inRegulation of CREBH by ERRcPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342part, through a post-transcriptional effect on endothelial NOsynthase mRNA stability. Diminished NO bioactivity, in turn,inhibits angiogenesis, an important compensatory mechanismduring chronic ischemia [50]. CRP has also been implicated inglucose metabolism. CRP infusion induces an inflammatoryresponse followed by increased norepinephrine and cortisol levels,which result in increased gluconeogenesis [51]. Our initial results(Figs. 1\u20133) linking ER stress to ERRc-mediated induction ofCREBH, raise the possibility that ERRc might regulate CREBHtarget genes by regulating CREBH itself. ERRc significantlyinduced CRP gene expression (Fig. 4), which further verifies theER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. Alcohol consumption induceshepatic ERRc expression [8]. ERRc gene expression increases inthe liver of db/db mice [6]. Moreover, ERRc along with CREBHare positive regulators of gluconeogenesis [6,15]. In agreementwith these previous reports, alcohol treatment significantly inducedboth CREBH and CRP gene expression, and this augmentationwas substantially compromised upon ERRc inhibition in vivo(Fig. 5B). Regulation of CREBH by ERRc was further establishedwhen GSK5182 treatment significantly reduced CREBH and itstarget gene, CRP, expression in db/db mice liver tissue (Fig. 5C).ERRc, CREBH, and CRP are implicated in numerousbiological events. ERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis [6]and hepatic lipid metabolism [7]. CREBH positively regulateshepatic gluconeogenesis [15]. In addition, CREBH is a masterregulator of the lipin 1 gene, a key regulator of lipid metabolism[17]. Both CREBH and ERRc gene expression is enhanced in adiabetic mouse model to increase blood glucose level [15,6].Regulation of both factors is important to regulate gluconeogenesisin response to ER stress, and diabetes. Because the regulation ofCRP is also very critical to maintain glucose homeostasis as well asother cellular phenomena including angiogenesis, inhibitingCREBH transactivity and CRP gene expression by inhibitingERRc through GSK5182 could be important to relieve diseasesymptoms. As depicted in Fig. 5D, we hypothesize that ERRcdirectly binds to the CREBH promoter along with coactivatorPGC1a to regulate CREBH at the transcriptional level in responseto ER stress and other physiological conditions, and that CREBH,in turn, regulates its target genes. Overall, our current findingsprovide insight into a novel chromatin remodeling strategy utilizedby ERRc, and it may be helpful to understand the complex linkbetween nuclear receptors, ER membrane-bound transcriptionfactors, and glucose homeostasis.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank our lab members for technical assistance, KezhongZhang for providing us with CRP promoter.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: JM HSC.
