Kozub\u00edk).a b s t r a c tWe demonstrated that TNF-a suppressed differentiation and potentiated cell death induced by buty-rate (NaBt) in both adenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal FHC human colon cells in vitro. Since TNF-a is atypical activator of NF-jB pathway, we studied the role of NF-jB activation in cell differentiationand death during the TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment. TNF-a induced rapid NF-jB activation in bothHT-29 and FHC cell lines and this effect was differently modulated by NaBt in these two cell lines.In HT-29 cells, NaBt potentiated NF-jB activity induced by TNF-a after 4 h treatment. However, thisinitial potentiation of NF-jB activity was not observed in FHC cells. During additional time of TNF-aand NaBt co-treatment, NaBt decreased the TNF-a-mediated NF-jB activity in both cell types. Wealso detected a different response of HT-29 and FHC cells after the pre-treatment with the NF-jBinhibitor parthenolide. Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis ofcolon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we found significant differences inthe mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancerorigin, suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively involved in these processes incancer cells.\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Above all, the quantity and ratio of lipids and fiber contentin the diet are among the most important factors. Mutual interac-tion of endogenous and dietary substances may influence colorec-tal epithelium in various ways. They can encourage a rise ofinfectious and inflammatory diseases or cancer of the intestineand, on the other hand, they may contribute to regeneration of in-jured tissue or disease therapy [1,2].Short-chain fatty acid butyrate is formed in the gastrointestinaltract of mammals as a result of anaerobic bacterial fermentation ofdietary fiber [3,4]. It modulates proliferation and induces differen-tiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells [5,3], both in vivo andin vitro, at concentrations of approximately 5 mM [6]. Butyrate canalso act as an energy source for the colonocytes. It has paradoxicaleffects on colonic epithelial proliferation\u2014stimulates proliferationof normal crypt cells and inhibits growth of colon cancer cells[7]. Thus, butyrate contributes significantly to the balance betweenthe cytokinetic processes of epithelial cells in the colon crypts.ll rights reserved.TNF-a, an endogenously produced cytokine of the TNF family,belongs to the intensively investigated biologically active sub-stances [8]. It plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatoryprocesses, endotoxic shock, and regulation of cell growth anddeath [9,10]. NNF-a is synthesized by macrophages and othercells in response to bacterial toxins, inflammatory products andother invasive stimuli. It has been suggested that a gut with ac-tive injury contains an increased number of NNF-a-secretingcells [11]. Endogenous TNF-a at levels higher than those in thecorresponding normal colorectal tissues have also been detectedin extracts of colorectal tumor tissues resected from human pa-tients [12,13].The proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, are typicalactivators of the canonical NF-jB signaling cascade, which is acti-vated in response to injury, infection, inflammation and otherstress conditions [14,15]. Butyrate has been shown to reduceinflammation in experimental colitis in rats [16], and to decreaseproinflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal biopsies fromCrohn\u2019s disease patients via NF-jB inactivation [17]. Therefore,it could be used during the therapy of colorectal chronic inflam-mations. On the other hand, it has been suggested that NF-jBactivation has anti-apoptotic effects in many cell lines [18]. In-creased expression of IjB family proteins has also been foundin differentiated parts of the colon crypts where the cells undergoapoptosis [19].mailto:kozubik@ibp.czhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/1043466634 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343Transcription factors of the NF-jB family, including RelA (p65),c-Rel, RelB, NFKB1 (p50/p105), and NFKB2 (p52/p100), regulatehundreds of genes in the context of multiple important physiolog-ical and pathological processes [14,20]. In most cells, NF-jB ispresent as a latent, inactive inhibitor of the jB (IjB)-bound com-plex in the cytoplasm. There are two main pathways leading tothe activation of NF-jB, namely the canonical and non-canonicalpathways or the classical and alternative pathways, respectively.In both pathways, activation of an IjB kinase (IKK) complex isthe common upstream regulatory step. This results in phosphory-lation-induced degradation of the IjB, which enables the NF-jB di-mers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target geneexpression. During the canonical pathway, heterodimers of RelA(p65) with p50, p52, or p50 homodimers are liberated by degrada-tion of IjBs, particularly IjB-a, while p52/RelB heterodimers aretranslocated to the nucleus during the non-canonical pathway[21,15,22].Comparing the effects of butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment be-tween cancer and non-cancer cells in vitro (using human colonadenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal colon FHC cell lines) we demon-strated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of colonepithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we inves-tigated involvement of the activation of NF-jB transcription factorin the mechanisms of the butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment effects.It has been demonstrated previously that preincubation of cellswith butyrate, which induced differentiation, is able to inhibitTNF-a-activated NF-jB translocation in colon cancer cell lines(HT-29, CaCo-2, SW620) [23,24]. In the present study, we foundsignificant differences in the mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-aco-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer origin,suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively in-volved in these processes in cancer cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culturesThe human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and human fetalcolon FHC cells (both ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in25 mm2 flasks (TPP; Trasadigen, Switzerland) in McCoy\u2019s 5A med-ium and in Dulbecco\u2018s modified Eagle medium (DMEM):F12 (1:1)medium, respectively, supplemented with gentamicin (50 lg/ml;all Sigma\u2013Aldrich; Prague, Czech Republic) and 10% fetal bovineserum (PAN Biotech GmbH; Aidenbach, Germany). The cultureswere maintained at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The cellswere passaged twice a week after exposure to trypsin/EDTA(0.05/0.02%) with a plating density of 1:3. For the experiments,cells were seeded in 40 \ufffd 10 mm or 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes, orin 12- or 24-well plates (TPP) at a density of 5 \ufffd 104 cells/cm2.Twenty-four hours after seeding the cells were treated with NaBt(5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; both Sigma\u2013Aldrich), or both, as indi-cated in the respective experiments. For the inhibition of NF-jBactivation, the cells were pre-treated for 3 h with the inhibitor ofIKK phosphorylation parthenolide (Biomol International, LP; PA,USA) dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 (HT-29 cells) or20 (FHC cells) lM. The cells were harvested 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 hafter the treatments. The culture medium was not replaced duringthe experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml; Invitro-gen Corporatiom; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as a positive controlfor MAPK pathway activation.2.2. Cell number countingCell growth was measured by counting the cells with a CoulterCounter (model ZM, Coulter Electronic, Luton, UK). Floating andadherent cells were counted separately, and the number of floatingcells was expressed as a percentage of the whole cell number.2.3. Cell cycle distribution analysisThe cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice inphosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol.DNA was stained (37 \ufffdC; 30 min) with Vindelov\u2019s solution (10 mMTris buffer, pH 8; 0.7 mg/ml RNAse; 50 lg/ml propidium iodide;0.1% Triton X-100). The DNA content was analyzed using flowcytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA; argonion laser, 488 nm for excitation). Cells (15 \ufffd 103) were acquiredfor each sample and the percentage of cells in the individual cellcycle phases was analyzed using ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Soft-ware House, Topsham, CA). Single cells were identified and gatedby pulse-code processing of the area and the width of the signal.Cell debris was excluded by appropriate rising of the forward scat-ter threshold.2.4. MTT assayThe cells were growing on 96-well plates. Ten microliters of the2.5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiasol-2yl]-2,5-diphe-nyl-tetrasolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well.After 4 h of incubation at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, themedium was removed, 50 ll of the extraction buffer (10% TritonX-100; 0.1 M HCl) was added and plates were gently shaken for2 h at room temperature [17]. The optical densities were measuredat 570 nm (DigiScan Reader).2.5. Fluorescence microscopyThe cells were trypsinized and 0.5\u20132 \ufffd 106 cells (includingfloating cell population) were incubated with 40 ll of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) staining solution (3 lg DAPI/ml of methanol) in room temperature, in the dark for 30 min,and mounted to Mowiol. Apoptotic cells were counted using afluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX70; Olympus; Prague,Czech Republic). The percentage of cells with the characteristicapoptotic nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation andfragmentation) was determined from a total number of 200cells.2.6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity determinationThe cells were trypsinized, 5 \ufffd 105 cells were resuspended in500 ll of substrate buffer (10% diethanolamine; 5 mM MgCl2; pH9.7), and lysed by sonication for 5 \ufffd 10 s using a Branson SonifierB-12 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp.; Danbury, CT) at a power of 30watts. The cell lysates or alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Sigma\u2013Al-drich) in several concentrations (15.6\u20131000 \ufffd 10\ufffd6 U/well) for acalibration curve were incubated with ALP substrate (4-p-nitro-phenylphosphate; Fluka) in a 96-well plate (4 parallel wells in eachgroup) at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 MNaOH (50 ll/well) and the optical densities were measured at405 nm by FluostarGalaxy (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offen-burg, Germany). The reading values (Units \ufffd 10\ufffd6/5 \ufffd 104 cells)were converted to the percentage of control.2.7. Nuclear extracts preparationCells grown on 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes were washed withice-cold PBS, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at0 \ufffdC (1000g). The pellets were then incubated in a lysis buffer(10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,0.1 mM PMSF, 0.05% NP-40) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged forM. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 354 min at 0 \ufffdC (750g). The resulting \u2018\u2018nuclear pellets\u201d were rinsedwith the above lysis buffer without PMSF and NP-40. Nuclear ex-tracts were prepared by resuspending nuclear pellets in nuclearextraction buffer (20 mM Tris base, 420 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM MgCl2,0.25 mM EDTA (chelate II), 25% glycerol), incubating 30 min at4 \ufffdC, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 \ufffdC (13,000g). Protein con-centration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradfordassay, and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until used.2.8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)Double stranded NF-jB oligonucleotide (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC; VBC-Genomics GmbH; Vienna, Austria) was end-labeledwith biotin using the Biotin end-labeling kit (Pierce; Rockford, IL).The binding reactions were performed by mixing 8 lg of the nucle-ar extract (prepared as described above) with 0.3 lg poly-dIdC and3 ll of the binding buffer 5\ufffd (50 mM Tris base, 6 mM EDTA (che-late II), 0.5 mM DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol) to give a final volume of17 ll. After 10 min incubation in room temperature, 3 ll of10 lM oligonucleotide was added to each reaction and the reac-tions were incubated for an additional 30 min in room tempera-ture. For the supershift, 1 ll of mouse anti-NF-kB p65 antibody(#sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA) wasthen added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for1 h in 4 \ufffdC. To control specificity of the shifts, we also used specificcompetition (addition of the excess of unlabeled NF-jB oligonu-cleotide), non-specific competition (addition of the excess of unla-beled EBNA DNA), free probe, and the reaction mixture without thenuclear extract. The reaction mixtures were separated in a 6.5%polyacrylamide/TBE gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane(Intergen; Purchase, NY). The visualization by streptavidin\u2013horse-radish peroxidase conjugate was performed using the LightShiftTMChemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce).2.9. Western blot analysisThe cells were scraped and lysed in an SDS lysis buffer (100 mMTris, pH 6.8; 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 10% glycerol). Theextracts of the total proteins were assayed with a DC protein assaykit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Equal amounts(20 lg) of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts with 0.01% brom-phenol blue and 1% mercaptoethanol were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGEusing 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to poly-vinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA)electrophoretically in a buffer containing 192 mM glycine, 25 mMTris, and 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in5% powdered non-fat milk in wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in20 mM Tris; pH 7.6; 140 mM NaCl). Primary antibodies (rabbitanti-NF-jB p65, 1:500, #3034; rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2,1:2000, #9101; rabbit anti-ERK1/2, 1:1000, #9102; rabbit anti-phospho-p38, 1:2000, #9211; rabbit anti-p38, 1:1000, #9212; allCell Signaling Technology, Inc.; Beverly, MA; rabbit anti-I-jBa,1:500, #sc-203, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated withthe blots for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the mem-branes in a wash buffer, secondary antibodies coupled to horserad-ish peroxidase (anti-mouse IgG, 1:3000; #NA931 and anti-rabbitIgG, 1:5000, #NA934, both Amersham Biosciences; Buckingham-shire, UK) were added for 1 h. The membranes were washed andantibody reactivity was visualized with the enhanced chemilumi-nescence (ECL+) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) against X-rayfilm-CP (Agfa-Gevaert Group; Mortsel, Belgium). The equal loadingwas verified by b-actin or a-tubulin expression (mouse anti-b-ac-tin, 1:6000, #A5441; mouse anti-a-tubulin, 1:4000, #T6074; bothSigma) and non-specific amidoblack staining of proteins on themembrane after immunoblotting.2.10. Luciferase reporter construct and stable cell transfectionThe reporter construct pBIIX-LUC was kindly donated by Dr. KalleSaksela (Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Tampere, Fin-land). The NF-jB-driven plasmid pBIIX-LUC was constructed byinserting a synthetic fragment with two copies of the sequenceACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG separated by four nucleotides(ATCT) in front of the mouse fos promoter in plasmid pfLUC [25].The reporter plasmid was cotransfected with pSV2neo neomycin-resistance plasmid into HT-29 cells using electroporation (Bio-RadLaboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Briefly, approximately 1\ufffd 107 cellswas mixed with 20 lg of reporter plasmid and 2 lg of pSV2neo plas-mid, and electroporated (275 V, 950 lF, 2\ufffd pulse). Subsequently, thecells were seeded on a 100\ufffd 20 mm dish (TPP) with a feeder of HT-29cells treated with mitomycin-C (5 lg/ml; Sigma\u2013Aldrich). Neomycinresistant clones were selected in 300 lg/ml of geneticin (G418 sulfate;Alexis; San Diego, CA). The clones containing the reporter plasmidwere confirmed by luciferase activity assay.2.11. Luciferase activity assayStably transfected cells were seeded in 12-well plates and trea-ted 24 h later. After 4, 8, or 24 h treatment, the cells were rinsedwith PBS and then lysed with 100 ll of reagent (Luciferase AssaySystem; Promega Corp.; Madison, WI). Fifty microliters of the ex-tracts was mixed with 50 ll of luciferase substrate, and lumines-cence was quantified by a luminometer.2.12. Statistical analysisAll the data are expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of three indepen-dent experiments. Differences between the groups were calculatedusing one-way ANOVA. With all statistical analyses, an associatedprobability (P-value) of <5% was considered as significant.3. Results3.1. Growth, death, and differentiation of colon epithelial cells duringTNF-a and NaBt co-treatment3.1.1. Cell growthCompared to control, TNF-a in a concentration of 15 ng/ml didnot significantly affect cell proliferation of both cell lines used atany time of treatment. On the other hand, NaBt (5 mM) inhibitedcell growth in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines (Fig. 1A), but with dif-ferent dynamics. The NaBt effect was already apparent after 24 h,being most significant in FHC cells after 72 h (approximately 70%decrease of cell number versus control). In HT-29 cells, NaBt inhib-ited cell growth the most significantly after 24 and 48 h of thetreatment (approximately 40% decrease of cell number versus con-trol), and the effect diminished after 72 h (only 20% decrease). Noadditional changes of cell growth were detected after NaBt andTNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines.3.1.2. Cell cycleNaBt arrested the cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle andsimultaneously decreased the proportion of cells in the S-phase(Fig. 1B). This effect corresponded with cell growth inhibitionshown in Fig. 1A in both HT-29 and FHC cells, and was not signif-icantly affected during co-treatment of NaBt with TNF-a. More-over, TNF-a alone had no effect on cell cycle distribution.3.1.3. Cell differentiationNaBt induced a significant increase in intracellular ALPactivity (a marker of colonocyte differentiation) in both HT-Fig. 1.

While TNF-aalone had no effect, it significantly suppressed the NaBt-in-duced ALP activity (approximately 3.2-fold in HT-29 cellsand 5.5-fold in FHC cells after 48 h of TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment).M.

Cell deathIn comparison to control, TNF-a did not significantly affect themitochondrial enzymatic activity (measured by MTT assay), per-centage of floating cells or the number of apoptotic cells (DAPIstaining) in both cell lines used. The mitochondrial enzymaticactivity of the both HT-29 and FHC cells was decreased by NaBtalone with the high effectiveness in cancer cells (approximately40% decrease versus control). The effect was significantly elevatedafter 72 h of NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines(Fig. 2A). The percentage of floating cells was increased by NaBtFig. 2.

While NaBt did not induce apop-tosis in FHC cells, it increased the number of cells with morpholog-ically detected apoptosis (up to 10%) of HT-29 cells (Fig. 2C).However, after 48 or 72 h of TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, the le-vel of apoptosis was significantly elevated in both cancer and nor-mal cells in comparison with NaBt and TNF-a alone.(A), floating cell number determined as percentage from whole cell population (B)ing DAPI staining and fluorescent microscopy (C) HT-29 and FHC cells treated for 24,e presented as mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (**P < 0.01)< 0.05 (\ufffdP < 0.01) versus TNF-a alone.38 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u2013433.2. NF-jB activation in HT-29 and FHC cells during TNF-a and NaBtco-treatmentWe investigated the role of NF-jB in the above-described ef-fects comparing fetal FHC and cancer HT-29 cells. To study NF-jB activation, four different approaches were used. Firstly, weestablished HT-29 cell clones with a pBIIX-LUC reporter constructfor NF-jB activity detection. TNF-a induced an increase in NF-jBactivity in HT-29 cells compared with the untreated control, andthis effect was time-dependent (approximately 41- or 27-fold in-crease after 4 h, 47- or 36-fold increase after 8 h, and 75- or 48-foldincrease after 24 h treatment in clone 3 or clone 93, respectively;Fig. 3). Secondly, the time-dependent increase of TNF-a-inducedNF-jB binding activity in HT-29 and FHC cells was also observedby electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fig. 4). Thirdly,translocation of p65 protein into the nucleus was confirmed in nu-clear extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells using Western blotting(Fig. 5). Finally, expression of NF-jB inhibitory IjB-a protein wasdetected in whole HT-29 and FHC cell extracts using Western blot-ting. TNF-a induced a decrease of IjB-a expression after 4, 8, and24 h in both cell lines (Fig. 6).NaBt alone had no effect on NF-jB activity during a short-timeinterval, but after 24 h the elevation of the activity compared tocontrol was apparent in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines. In HT-29cells, this increased activity was detected by clones with the repor-ter construct (Fig. 3), p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts(Fig. 5), and by a decrease of IjB expression (Fig. 6). However, itdid not appear in EMSA analysis (Fig. 4). On the other hand, inFig. 3. NF-jB binding activity (expressed as relative luciferase activity) of two HT-29 cloNaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. Data are presented as meancontrols considered as 100%; \u00a7P < 0.05 (\u2013P < 0.01) versus NaBt alone; \ufffdP < 0.05 versus TNFHC cells the elevation of NF-jB activity mediated by NaBt 24 htreatment was observed by all methods used except for Westernblot of p65 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5).After co-treatment with TNF-a and NaBt, NF-jB activity wasdifferently modulated in cancer and fetal cells compared to the ef-fect of TNF-a alone. While the NF-jB binding activity (Figs. 3 and4), its nuclear translocation (Fig. 5), and IjB degradation (Fig. 6)were initially increased after 4 h of the TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-ment in comparison with TNF-a alone in HT-29 cells, these effectsdid not appear in FHC cells (Figs. 4\u20136). After 8 h of TNF-a and NaBtco-treatment, the activity (Figs. 3 and 4) and nuclear translocation(Fig. 5) of NF-jB and IjB degradation (Fig. 6) were similar withthat of TNF-a alone treatment in both cell lines. Finally, theseparameters were decreased after 24 h (TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-ment compared to treatment with TNF-a alone; Figs. 3\u20136).3.3. Effects of NF-jB inhibition on HT-29 and FHC cell differentiationand apoptosis during TNF-a and NaBt co-treatmentIn order to inhibit NF-jB binding activity, we searched for opti-mal dose and time of parthenolide pre-treatment of HT-29 and FHCcells. As indicated in Fig. 7, we used both EMSA (Fig. 7A and C) andWestern blot of nuclear extracts for p65 expression (Fig. 7B and D)to test the effects of 1 or 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (20or 10 lM) on inhibition of TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation. A sig-nificant decrease of NF-jB translocation to the nucleus was de-tected after 3 h of parthenolide pre-treatment in both cell linesused, but in FHC cells, the decrease was apparent only after highernes (#3 and #93) with pBIIX-LUC construct after 4, 8, or 24 h treatment with eithers \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (**P < 0.01) versus untreatedF-a alone.Fig. 4.

Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 39concentration of parthenolide. Thus, we used a 3 h pre-treatmentwith 10 lM of parthenolide for HT-29 cells and 20 lM for FHC cellsfor further experiments. To exclude the effects of this NF-jB inhib-itor on MAPK pathways, Western blot analysis for phosphorylatedand total protein expression of ERK1/2 and p38 after 3 h of parthe-nolide pre-treatment (10 lM for HT-29 and 20 lM for FHC cells)and/or 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml), which was used asa positive control for MAPK pathway activation, was performed(Fig. 7E). No changes in ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and noinhibition of EGF-mediated MAPK activation was detected afterparthenolide pre-treatment.Both HT-29 and FHC cells presented decreased sensitivity toNaBt-mediated inhibition of cell growth after parthenolide pre-treatment (Fig. 8A). However, cell growth was not significantly af-fected by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatments in both parthenolide pre-treated and non-pre-treated cells compared to NaBt alone.Parthenolide increased apoptosis induced by NaBt (DAPI stain-ing) in both HT-29 and FHC cells (Fig. 8B). However, apoptosis in-duced by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was modulated byparthenolide differently in HT-29 and FHC cells. While in HT-29cells, parthenolide significantly potentiated apoptosis induced bythis type of treatment (3.6-fold increase versus NaBt alone), no sig-nificant effect of was apparent in FHC cells (1.6-fold increase ver-sus NaBt alone).Unlike FHC cells, the differentiation ability of HT-29 cells in-duced by NaBt was strongly decreased after parthenolide pre-treatment (Fig. 8C). In FHC cells, the suppressive effect of TNF-aon NaBt-mediated cell differentiation (5.8-fold decrease of ALPactivity versus NaBt alone) was attenuated after parthenolidepre-treatment (2.7-fold decrease of ALP activity versus NaBtalone).4. DiscussionColon epithelial cell kinetics may be affected by endogenousgrowth regulators or by dietary factors like TNF-a and butyrate,respectively. We demonstrated that TNF-a markedly reducedNaBt-induced differentiation in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cellscontrary to its potentiation of apoptosis [26]. The ability of TNF-ato synergize with NaBt in promoting apoptosis in colon cancer cellsFig. 5.

Expression of b-actin or PCNA was used as equal loadingcontrol. Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.Fig. 6.

Similar results were obtained in two otherindependent experiments.40 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343was shown also by other authors [27\u201329]. However, we newlydemonstrate a TNF-a-mediated increase of apoptosis induced byNaBt in non-cancer cell line (FHC) derived from normal human fe-tal colon. We found a much more dramatic increase of NaBt-in-duced differentiation in cancer HT-29 than in fetal FHC cells. Thisdifferent dynamic was already demonstrated by Fajkus et al. [30].Interestingly, NaBt-mediated differentiation was significantly sup-pressed by TNF-a in both cell lines, with the higher effectiveness inFHC cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that induction of theapoptotic process by NaBt is reduced or delayed in fetal cells com-pared to cancer cells. On the other hand, the potentiation of apop-tosis by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was observed in both cancerand fetal cells.We suggested NF-jB to be involved in the mechanism of TNF-a-induced modulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis mediatedby NaBt. The transcription factor NF-jB can play a pivotal role inregulating programmed cell death and can possess the ability toactivate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes [31]. TNF-abelongs to the typical activators of the canonical pathway of NF-jB activation, which is completed by p50/p65 heterodimer bindingto DNA. To elucidate the role of NF-jB activation during the inves-tigated TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, were compared cancer HT-29 and fetal FHC colon cell lines with regard to this parameter.We detected time-dependent TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation inHT-29 cells using a reporter constructs sensitive to NF-jB activity(pBIIX-LUC). Moreover, we indicated a strong activation of NF-jBby TNF-a not only in HT-29, but also in normal FHC cells (resultsof EMSA, p65 expression in nuclear extracts, and decreased levelof IjB in whole cell extracts). From the report of Zwacka et al. itcould be supposed that TNF-a-induced prolonged NF-jB activationis associated with TNF-a resistance [32]. Considering that both HT-29 and FHC cells are relatively resistant to TNF-a cytotoxicity thisobservation is in agreement with our results.In accord with the results of Rouet-Benzineb et al. we demon-strated no changes in NF-jB binding activity after short-time treat-ment with NaBt (4 or 8 h) in both cell lines [33]. However, after24 h of NaBt treatment, the NF-jB activity was enhanced in bothcells of adenocarcinoma and fetal origin despite the previouslypublished results that butyrate decreased the activity of this tran-scription factor [34]. It has been previously found that butyratecould alter NF-jB subunit composition induced by proinflamma-tory cytokines. Inan et al. demonstrated that NaBt pre-treatmentof HT-29 cells inhibits the TNF-a-mediated p65 and p50 transloca-tion to the nucleus [35]. These authors also suggested that NaBtprevented the NF-jB subunit translocation by suppressing cellularproteasome activity (and subsequently IjB degradation) throughNaBt ability to inhibit histone deacetylases [24,36]. However, ourresults showed that NaBt increased TNF-a-mediated NF-jB bind-ing activity, p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degradation incancer HT-29 cells, but not in fetal FHC cells, after 4 h of NaBtand TNF-a co-treatment. The difference in NaBt ability to modulateTNF-a-mediated NF-jB activation between cancer and fetal colonepithelial cells represents the most important finding of the pres-ent study. The NaBt-mediated increase of TNF-a-induced NF-jBactivity in HT-29 cells disappeared during the subsequent 4 h oftreatment, and after 24 h NaBt significantly inhibited the TNF-a-induced NF-jB binding activity in both cell lines. The inhibitionof TNF-a-induced p65 nuclear translocation by NaBt pre-treatmentwas also indicated in SW480 and SW620 human colon carcinomacells [37,29]. While the NaBt concentration around 5 mM, whichcorresponds to the physiological concentration in the colon, wasthe same in the above-mentioned and our experiments, based onour previous works [38,39], we used significantly lower doses ofFig. 7. NF-jB binding activity (using EMSA) (A and C) and NF-jB p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts (B and D) of HT-29 (A and B) and FHC (C and D) cells after 1 or 3 hpre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 4 h treatment with TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or both (TNF + PAR). Phospho and total ERK1/2 and p38 protein expression(E) in whole cell extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells after 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) or both (PAR + EGF).PCNA and a-tubulin expressions were used as equal loading control. Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment.M.

The difference in the concentrationsof TNF-a used and also application of this cytokine simultaneouslywith NaBt (in contrast to NaBt pre-treatment used by the above-mentioned authors) may play a role in the dissimilarity of ourresults.To study the involvement of NF-jB in the modulation of NaBteffects by TNF-a, we used an NF-jB inhibitor, sesquiterpene lac-tone parthenolide. It prevents the NIK- and MEKK1-induced activa-tion of IKKs, but does not interfere with the induced activation ofMAPKs [40]. We found a significant difference in parthenolide sen-sitivity between fetal and cancer cells, which may be correspondedto the distinct way of NF-jB activation in these two cell lines.Moreover, in cancer cell line, pre-treatment with parthenolidecaused a significant increase of apoptosis induction by NaBt andTNF-a co-treatment, while, in fetal cells, it inhibited apoptosis in-duced by this type of treatment. This distinct response could beassociated with lower differentiation status in NaBt- or both NaBtand TNF-a-treated HT-29 cells after parthenolide pre-treatmentcompared with FHC cells.Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation andapoptosis of colon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Fur-thermore, we found significant differences in the mechanism of theresponse to NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment between cells of non-cancer and adenocarcinoma origin, suggesting that the NF-jBpathway is more effectively involved in these processes in cancercells. Our findings imply the possible role of TNF-a in the develop-Fig. 8.
