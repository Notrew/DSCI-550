Kreydiyyeha,), Christina Abou-Chahinea, Randa Hilal-DandanbaDepartment of Biology, Faculty of Arts & Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, LebanonbDepartment of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, CA, USAReceived 7 September 2003; received in revised form 11 November 2003; accepted 26 November 2003AbstractRecent studies have shown that heart diseases are always accompanied with high levels of IL-1b and a decrease in NaC-KCATPase concentrations. This work studies the involvement of the cytokine in the observed changes in the pump. Rats were injectedintraperitoneally with 400 mg of IL-1b and 4 h later, the heart was isolated and a crude homogenate of the right and left ventricleswas prepared and tested for NaC-KCATPase activity and protein expression. IL-1b inhibited by around 70% the activity of theATPase in the left and right ventricles. This inhibition of the pump was ascribed to a decrease in its protein expression asdemonstrated by western blot analysis. A dose and time response study conducted on isolated cardiac myocytes confirmed theinhibitory role of the cytokine on the ATPase and showed that IL-1b exerts its maximal down-regulatory effect at 2 h and at a doseof 20 ng/ml. The cytokine caused also an up-regulation of the NaKCl2 cotransporter. Both MEK and p38MAPK were shown to beinvolved in the signaling pathway activated by the cytokine. It can be concluded that the decrease in the NaC-KCATPaseconcentration observed in heart diseases is a consequence of the accompanying high levels of IL-1b, and may be responsible for thedifferent symptoms that accompany cardiac ischemia.\ufffd 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionThere has been an increasing body of evidencesupporting the existence of an inflammatory componentin both the development and progression of heart failure[1,2]. Cytokines, in particular TNF-alpha, IL-1 andIL-6, have been identified as major players in thepathogenesis of the disease, and in the failing heart, anincrease in their circulating levels has been noted thatcorrelates with the severity of the symptoms and a worseprognosis [3,4]. These inflammatory mediators [5] havebeen shown, in addition, to induce cardiac hypertrophyand exert a negative inotropic effect on the perfusedheart [6,7].Heart failure coupled with ischemia and myocardialhypertrophy were associated in turn with a decrease in) Corresponding author.

The glycosides inhibit the NaC-KCpump, increase intracellular sodium, and reduce thesodium electrochemical gradient that constitutes thedriving force for calcium extrusion through the NaC/CaCCexchanger, leading thus to an increase in intra-cellular calcium content, and consequently enhancedcontractility.The NaC-KCpump is a heterodimer composed of ana catalytic subunit and a b glycoprotein subunit. Manyisoforms of each subunit have been detected and areexpressed in a tissue-specific manner [11]. Rat cardio-myocytes express the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms whilemailto:sawkreyd@aub.edu.lbhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/jnlabr/ycyto2 S.I. Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e8in humans all three isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are present [9].Schwinger et al. [12] demonstrated a decrease in theprotein expression of the a1 and a3 subunits by, re-spectively, 38 and 30% in human failing hearts whilethe activity decreased by 42%.In addition to glycosides, loop-diuretics are also usedin the treatment of heart failure [13]. They are thoughtto alleviate pulmonary edema, congestive heart failureand hypertension by inhibiting the renal NaKCl2cotransporter and promoting diuresis and natriuresis.Many other reports showed, however, that the clinicalrelief of symptoms preceded in many instances the onsetof diuresis [14,15] and occurred even in presence ofmarked impairment of renal function [16,17] suggestinga direct effect of the loop-diuretics on the cardiomyo-cytes NaKCl2 cotransporter [18]. It is well known thatthe activity of this transporter is geared by the sodiumgradient established by the NaC-KCATPase.Regulation of NaC-KCATPase seems thus to becritical for a proper functioning of the myocardium andany impairment in its activity is expected to result inchanges in the electrochemical gradient that drives thesodium influx and calcium extrusion leading to alter-ations in the contraction/relaxation processes.Although in heart failure, changes in the NaC-KCATPase activity and expression were noted toaccompany increases in circulating levels of IL-1b, thepresence of a causeeeffect relationship between thecytokine and the pump has not been properly in-vestigated.Because we have shown previously that IL-1-b de-creases the protein expression of the NaC-KCATPase inthe rat kidney and intestine [19,20] and up-regulates theNaKCl2 cotransporter, we speculate that this pro-inflammatory cytokine may exert a similar effect incardiac myocytes.The aim of this work was to study the effect of IL-1bon the activity and protein expression of the NaC-KCATPase and NaKCl2 symporter in the rat heart usingtwo different approaches: treating the whole animal withthe cytokine or isolating myocytes and then treatingthem with IL-1b.2. Results2.1. IL-1b reduces the activity and proteinexpression of the NaC-KCATPasein the right and left ventriclesIL-1b reduced protein expression of the NaC-KCATPase in right and left ventricular homogenatesprepared from animals treated with the cytokine by 45and 40%, respectively (Fig. 1a,b).Interleukin-1 b inhibited also the activity of theATPase in both ventricles by around 70% (Fig. 2a,b).2.2. Effect of IL-1b on the NaC-KCATPaseof myocytes isolated from treated animalsBecause the ventricular homogenate is a mixture ofdifferent types of cells, the observed change in theATPase activity and expression may not reflect neces-sarily changes in cardiomyocytes. To clarify this pointcardiomyocytes were isolated from animals treated withIL-1b, and the activity and protein expression of theATPase was studied in a homogenate of these isolatedcells rather than in a homogenate of the whole ventricle.IL-1b caused down-regulation of the pump in isolatedcardiomyocytes (Fig. 3) and inhibited its activity (Fig. 4)by around 85%.Fig. 1.

Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e82.3. Effect of the cytokine on the NaC-KCATPaseof treated isolated myocytesTo know whether IL-1b exerts its effect directly oncardiomyocytes or through the release of other factorsby other cells, myocytes were isolated and treated withdifferent doses of the cytokine for different time periods.IL-1b reduced in a dose and time-dependent mannerthe protein expression (Fig. 5) and activity (Fig. 6) ofthe NaC-KCATPase in isolated myocytes. The highestinhibitory effect was observed at 2 h and a dose of 20 ng/ml. The results suggest that the cytokine acts directly onthe cardiomyocytes.2.4.

IL-1b up-regulates the NaKCl2 cotransporterOur previous work on the effect of IL-1b on colono-cytes [20] demonstrated that in addition to the NaC-KCATPase, the cytokine affects the protein expression ofthe NaKCl2 cotransporter. To see whether a similareffect could be exerted in cardiomyocytes, we studiedthe protein expression of the NaKCl2 cotransporter inFig. 3.

IL-1b up-regulated the cotrans-porter in both cases as it did in colon cells.3. DiscussionThis work has used three different approaches tostudy the effect of IL-1b on the rat cardiac NaC-KCATPase. The first involved treating the animals withthe cytokine and then studying ATPase activity andprotein expression in homogenates of the right and leftventricles. In the second approach, animals were treatedwith the cytokine and then cardiomyocytes were isolatedand a cell lysate prepared and used in the study ofthe ATPase. The third approach consisted of isolatingthe cardiomyocytes and then treating them with thecytokine.IL-1b reduced the protein expression of the a1subunit of the NaC-KCATPase in right and leftventricular homogenates and exerted a significant in-hibition of the ATPase activity which correlated with itsdown-regulatory effect and could thus be ascribed to theFig. 6.

The results reconfirmed the down-regulatoryeffect of the cytokine on the ATPase as well as theinhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity.An inflammatory response is the result of a cytokinecascade, where one cytokine leads to the release ofanother until the final response is elicited. Thus IL-1b,a pro-inflammatory cytokine, when injected to rats, mayhave exerted its effect directly on myocytes or indirectlyby acting on other target cells and causing the release ofother cytokines or inflammatory mediators. To elucidatethis point, cardiomyocytes were isolated and thentreated in vitro with IL-1b. The inhibitory effect of thecytokine appeared in this case also, demonstrating thatIL-1b exerts its effect on the myocyte ATPase inde-pendent of any influence from neighboring tissues asmay occur in vivo in the whole animal.Because IL-1b is known to signal through the MAPKcascade [21,22] we investigated the involvement of thesekinases in the signal transduction pathway activated byIL-1b. PD98059 and SB202190, respective inhibitors ofMEK and p38 MAPK, abrogated the effect of IL-1b onthe protein expression of the a1 subunit, inferring thatboth MAPKs are involved in the signaling pathway. Theresults are in agreement with those reported by Ng et al.[23] who showed an implication of ERK and p38MAPKs in the IL-1b-induced delayed phosphorylationof STAT3 in cardiac myocytes.Since the observed inhibition of the NaC-KCATPaseby IL-1b was accompanied by down-regulation of its5S.I.

The blot is representative of an experiment repeated three times. Protein expression of b actin was used to check for equal loading.catalytic a1 subunit, it may be attributed, at leastpartially, to a decrease in the number of enzymemolecules. Such an inhibition is expected to decreasethe sodium gradient and sodium-dependent electrolytemovements that regulate excitationecontraction cou-pling in cardiac myocytes especially calcium movements.Cytosolic calcium increases during contractions and isrestored back to normal levels upon relaxation via theNaC-CaCCexchanger whose activity is dependent onthe sodium gradient established by the NaC-KCpump.An inhibition of the pump is thus expected to dissipatethe sodium gradient, inhibit the NaC-CaCCantiporter,increase cytosolic calcium and by so doing alter thesystolicediastolic cycle and delay relaxation. In fact,inhibition of the NaC-KCATPase has been reported insome cases of heart failure [24,25] and was associatedwith increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory cyto-kines. Similarly increases in cytosolic calcium werereported to occur in association with increases in thelevels of IL-1b and TNF-a [26]. The demonstratedinhibitory effect of IL-1b on the pump may thus providea possible explanation of the previously reportedincrease in cytosolic calcium levels [27,28] that occur inmyocytes following IL-1b treatment and whose causeremained controversial. We provide here a plausibleexplanation by attributing it indirectly to an inhibitionof the NaC-KCpump and consequently to the NaC/CaCCexchanger. Although our data lend support tothis hypothesis, it still needs to be confirmed by furtherexperimental work.The inhibition of the pump is expected also to alterthe function of the NaC/HCexchanger which regulatesintracellular pH and the activity of which is dependenton the sodium gradient generated by the NaC-KCAT-Pase. IL-1b is thus expected to increase intracellularacidity, a process that has already been reported in theischemic heart where pHi and pHo were noted to reachvalues as low as 6.0 and 6.5, respectively [29,30].This work showed that IL-1b reduced the activity ofthe NaC-KCATPase but up-regulated the NaKCl2cotransporter. A change in the NaC-KCATPase activityis known to elicit always a change of an opposite naturein the activity of the NaKCl2 cotransporter [31]. This isconsistent with our findings which are also in line withFig. 8.

The blot is representative of an experiment repeated three times. Protein expression of b actin was used to check forequal loading.6 S.I. Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e8Fig. 9.

Protein expression of b actin was used to check for equal loading.those of Liu et al. [31] who reported an inducedstimulation of the NaKCl2 transporter by ouabain, aninhibitor of the pump.A stimulation of the NaKCl2 cotransport is known toinduce cell swelling [32,33] and Clemo and Baumgarten[34] ascribed the observed decrease in the volume ofatrial myocytes by ANP to an inhibition of thecotransporter. On the other hand, cell swelling and highlevels of IL-1b were reported to accompany myocardialischemia [35], but the causes of the changes in cellvolume remained unidentified. Our findings may pro-vide an explanation, by attributing it to an up-regulationof the NaKCl2 cotransporter.It can be concluded that many of the symptoms ofheart failure may be ascribed to the effect of IL-1b oncardiomyocytes. By inhibiting the NaC-KCATPase, thecytokine increases intracellular sodium and inhibits theNaC-HCand NaC-CaCCexchangers resulting in a de-crease in pHi and an increase in cytosolic calcium thatmay lead to alterations in the systolicediastolic cycle. Theinhibition of the pump would lead also to up-regulationof the NaKCl2 cotransporter resulting in cell swelling,a prominent feature of ischemic cardiomyocytes.The NaC-KCpump constitutes thus an importanttarget site of action for IL-1b, and many of the reportedcytokine actions are mediated through an effect on thisATPase.It should be noted, however, that although this workprovides some possible explanations to the symptomsthat accompany heart failure, still more experimentalwork needs to be conducted to confirm them andestablish the direct or indirect implication of IL-1 b inthe disease. The long term effect of the cytokine on heartfunctions and NaC-KCATPase activity would also needto be investigated.4. Materials and methodsMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus)weighing 150e200 g were handled all through inaccordance with the Guide for Laboratory AnimalFacilities and Care, US Department of Health, Educa-tion and Welfare.4.1. Animal treatmentAnimals were injected i.p. with 400 ng IL-1b and 4 hlater, the heart was isolated. These doses were chosenbased on a previous study on the effect of this cytokineon the NaC-KCpump in intestines and kidneys.Control animals received instead, an equal volume ofphysiological saline (200 ml).Four hours after the injection of the cytokine, theheart was excised and placed in ice cold CaCC-freeperfusion buffer containing: 113 mM NaCl, 4.7 mMKCl, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 1.2 mMMgSO4\ufffd7H2O, 12 mM NaHCO3, 12 mM KHCO3,20 mM D-glucose, 10 mM NaC-Hepes, 2 mM creatine,2 mM carnitine, non-essential amino acids, pH= 7.2 at37 (C, cannulated via the aorta and perfused with thesame buffer for 4 min at 37 (C. The buffer was oxy-genated with 95%O2, 5%CO2 throughout the perfusionstep. The left and right ventricles were then isolated andhomogenized in Tris buffer containing: 200 mM NaCl;5 mM MgCl2\ufffd6H2O; 2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mMTriseHCl, pH 7.4. Aliquots of the homogenate werewithdrawn for western blot analysis or to assay for theNaC-KCATPase activity.4.2. Myocyte isolation and treatmentMyocytes were isolated as described by Hilal-Dandanet al. [36], suspended in oxygenated M 119 medium (pH7.2) (0.5e1 million cells per ml) supplemented withpenicillin (100 mg/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 1 ml/mlleupeptin and 0.1% BSA and incubated with differentconcentrations of IL-1b for different time periods at37 (C.When the involvement of MAP kinases was tested,PD98059 and SB202190, respective inhibitors of MEKand p38 MAP kinase were added to the cells at a final7S.I.

At the end of the incubation period, cells werecollected by a 5 min centrifugation at 1500g and 4 (C.4.3. Western blot analysisCrude membrane homogenates were prepared by lysisand homogenization of the myocytes followed by twoconsecutive 4 min spins at 1000g and 3300g and 4 (C.Membrane proteins were determined using the Bio-Radprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred NobelDrive, Hercules, CA 94547 USA), and equal loads were(30 mg) resolved on 8%polyacrylamide gels using aMini-Protean 3 System (Bio-Rad, CA,USA) and transferred toa PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The PVDFmembrane was then washed, blocked and incubatedovernight at 4 (C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-NaC/KCATPase a-1 IgG (Upstate biotechnology, LakePlacid, NY 12946), or with an anti-rat sodium potassiumchloride cotransporter antibody (Alpha Diagnostic In-ternational, TX, USA). Detection of the signal was byenhanced chemiluminescence using luminol reagent(Santa Cruiz Biotechnology Inc., CA, USA)4.4. NaC-KCATPase assayCrude myocyte membrane homogenates and ventric-ular homogenates were diluted in Tris buffer (200 mMNaCl; 5 mM MgCl2\ufffd6H2O; 2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl;200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4) to a respective concentra-tion of 0.1 mg and 1 mg protein/ml. Homogenates wereincubated with saponin (0.02%) for 30 min at roomtemperature, then 50 ml aliquots were re-incubated at37 (C for 10 min in the presence or absence of ouabain(4 mM final concentration). The reaction was theninitiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentrationof 1.25 mM and terminated after a 1 h incubation at37 (C by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (200 ml,11%). The samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 5 minand the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated in thesupernatant was measured colorimetrically according tothe method of Taussky and Shorr [37].
