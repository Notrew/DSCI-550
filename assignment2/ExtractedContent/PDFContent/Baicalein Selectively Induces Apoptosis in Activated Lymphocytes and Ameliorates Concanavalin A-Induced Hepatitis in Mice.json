Baicalein (BE), a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, possesses anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether BE can selectively induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and exerttherapeutic effect on AIH has not been studied.Methodology/Principal Findings: The pro-apoptotic properties of BE were evaluated in vitro on different types of immunecells, and in vivo effects of BE were examined in a murine model of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. In vitrotreatment with BE resulted in a higher increase in the level of apoptosis in Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes, Con A-stimulated CD3+ splenocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CD19+ splenocytes, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells, compared with that in unstimulated na\u0131\u0308ve ones. Murine bone marrow-derived dentriticcells, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells, either stimulated with LPS or unstimulated, were all insensitive to theBE-induced apoptosis. BE treatment also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of cytochrome crelease from mitochondria to the cytosol, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and activation of caspase-9,-3 in Con A-stimulated CD3+splenocytes and LPS-stimulated CD19+splenocytes, while showing no impact on Fas/FasL expressions andcaspase-8 activation. In vivo administration of BE alleviated Con A-induced liver injury, suppressed serum level of TNF-a andIFN-c, and reduced liver infiltration of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Furthermore, BE treatment increased the incidences ofapoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3+and CD19+splenocytes. When liver MNCs andsplenocytes from BE-treated mice were cultured in vitro for 24 h, they exhibited marked increase in apoptosis compared tovehicle-treated control.Conclusions/Significance: The present study demonstrates the ability of BE to promote apoptosis in activated lymphocytesthrough mitochondrial pathway and its potential use in the treatment of AIH.Citation: Zhang Y, Shan L, Hua Y, Wang D, Zeng H, et al.

The pathogenic mechanismsof AIH still remain unclear. The liver inflammation in AIHencompasses both cell-mediated cytotoxicity by infiltrating lym-phocytes and the production of autoantibodies. Therefore,abnormality in immune regulation is thought to be implicated inthe pathogenesis of this disease [2]. Currently, the only viabletreatments of AIH are immunosuppressant application and livertransplantation. But long term applications of currently availableimmunosuppressive drugs carries serious risks [3]. Therefore, it issignificantly important to develop new specific drugs.Deletion of activated and autoreactive lymphocytes by apoptosisis a critical mechanism by which the immune system maintainshomeostasis [4,5]. There is increasing evidence that abnormalitiesin this process might contribute to the development of AIH. It hasbeen reported that the activated lymphocytes in patients with AIHfail to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein,bcl-2, which may protect them from apoptosis and thereby extendthe disease process [6]. Fas/Fas-ligand system is known to plays aPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592key role in the control of activation-induced apoptosis oflymphocytes [7]. Four polymorphisms of human Fas gene havebeen associated with the occurrence of AIH in Japan [8], and onepolymorphism in the Fas gene promoter at position 2670 hasbeen associated with the early development of cirrhosis in whiteNorth American and Northern European patients with AIH [9].These data suggests that genetic factors that affect the integrity ofthe apoptotic pathway can influence the progression of AIHpossibly by perpetuating the survival of activated lymphocytes.Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis is considered to be anexperimental murine model of AIH [10,11]. A previous studydemonstrated that CD44-knockout mice exhibited enhancedpathogenesis in Con A-induced hepatitis, primarily due to inabilityof Con A-activated CD44-deficient T cells to undergo apoptosis[11]. A more recent study demonstrated that Galectin-3 deficiencyprevents Con A-induced hepatitis partly due to enhancedapoptosis in both liver-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs) andsplenocytes [12]. These evidence further support the notion thatdysregulation of apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is involved inthe pathogenesis of AIH.Since insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is anessential factor contributing to the development of AIH, specificinduction of apoptosis in activated lymphocyte should bebeneficial in depressing excess immune responses and inducinglong-lasting immunological tolerance, and thus represents a newtherapeutic strategy for AIH. Recently, a few compounds havebeen reported to selectively induce or potentiate apoptosis inactivated T cells and inhibit the development of autoimmunediseases in several animal models, including experimental allergicencephalitis [13,14], adjuvant arthritis [13], and Con A-inducedhepatitis [15]. These studies further demonstrated the feasibility oftreatment of autoimmune diseases by agents that induce apoptosisof activated T cells.Natural compounds purified from herbal medicines that haveknown indications for inflammatory disease conditions often havea low toxicity profile [16,17]. Therefore, exploring new immuno-suppressive agents that selectively induce apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes from herbal medicines is conducive to the develop-ment of novel effective pharmaceuticals for AIH. Baicalein (BE) isa flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensisGeorgi, known as \u2018\u2018Huang qin\u2019\u2019 in China [18]. This herb has beenwidely used in treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis,pneumonia, and diarrhea [19]. Previous studies have demonstrat-ed that BE possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties [20\u201325].However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated.Of note, BE has been reported to induce apoptosis in severalcancer cell lines, including human pancreatic [26], breast [27],prostate [28], and gastric [29] cancer cells. The pro-apoptoticeffects of BE on both lymphocytes cell line and human peripheralblood mononuclear cells has also been shown previously [30,31].However, whether it can selectively induce apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes has not been studied. In present study, we at firstconducted a series of in vitro experiments to investigate the pro-apoptotic effect of BE on various immunocytes of differentactivating status, and then used Con A-induced hepatitic mice asan animal model to determine whether BE could inducelymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has therapeutic potential forAIH. We demonstrated that BE selectively induced apoptosis inactivated lymphocytes and ameliorated Con A-induced hepatitis inmice. Our findings indicate that BE may have a therapeutic valuein the treatment of AIH and provides a new cellular mechanismfor its therapeutic effect.MethodsEthics StatementAll animal experiments were approved by the AdministrativeCommittee of Experimental Animal Care and Use of SecondMilitary Medical University (SMMU, Licence No. 2011023), andconformed to the National Institute of Health guidelines on theethical use of animals.ReagentsBE (purity .99%) was purchased from National Institute forthe Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, China.Con A, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate(PMA), and ionomycine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,MO, USA). PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (PE-mAbs)recognizing CD3, CD19, Fas, or FasL and FITC-conjugated mAbagainst active caspase-3 were purchased from BD PharMingen.MiceC57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, female) were purchased fromShanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., LTD (Shanghai, China).All animals were acclimatized under controlled temperature(2062uC), humidity (6065%) and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle for1 week before the experiment.Cell Preparation and CultureAll cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma)supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37uC in a5% CO2 atmosphere. Splenocytes were prepared by passingdisrupted spleen collected from C57BL/6 mice through a 70-mmnylon cell strainer (BD Labware), and depleting red blood cells by5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/volume]). CD3+cells and CD19+cells were isolated fromsplenocytes by magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS)-basedpurification using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit and B Cell Isolation Kit(Miltenyi Biotec), respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions, and the purity of obtain cells was more than 95% asdetermined by flow cytometry. Bone marrow (BM) cells wereprepared by flushing the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, filteringthrough a 70-mm nylon cell strainer, and depleting red blood cellsby 5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/volume]). Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated by culturing BMcells with 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macro-phage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (both from R&DSystems) for 6 days as previously described [32]. To stimulate DCsmaturation, LPS (500 ng/ml) was added to the culture on day 5.Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by plating cells lavagedfrom the mouse peritoneal cavity in 24-well flat-bottomed platesand removing nonadherent cells after 3 hours of culture [33]. Theobtained macrophages were stimulated with LPS (500 ng/ml) foradditional 24 h to activated them. Jurkat T cells and Raw264.7macrophage cells were stimulated for 24 h with PMA (25 ng/mL)/ionomycin (1 mM) and LPS (500 ng/ml), respectively, toinduce their activation.Apoptosis AssayCells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (annexin V-FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) (BD PharMingen, San Diego,California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, andanalyzed in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, SanJose, CA, USA). The percentages of apoptotic cells weredetermined as the sum of annexin V-FITC single-positive andannexin V-FITC/PI double-positive cells. In some experiments,Caspase-3 activation was determined using the FITC ActiveBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in LymphocytesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592Caspase-3 Apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, the cellswere fixed and permeabilized by adding 100 ml Cytofix/cytopermsolution at 4uC for 20 min, and the cells were then washed withPerm/Wash solution. The cells were stained intracellularly withFITC-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody for 30 min atroom temperature and subsequently analyzed by FACS CaliburFlow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).Assay for Expression of Fas and FasLExpression of Fas and FasL on lymphocytes was examined byflow cytometry after staining the cells with PE-conjugated mAbrecognizing Fas or FasL (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego,CA, USA ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Assay for Mitochondrial Membrane PotentialLoss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) was deter-mined by flow cytometry using J-aggregate forming lipophiliccationic probe JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)staining following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Subcellular Fractionation and Western BlottingThe preparation of whole cell lysates and mitochondrial andcytosolic fractions were performed as detailed previously [34]. Theprotein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins (20 mg) were separated bySDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDFmembrane (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The membraneswere probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-COX IV, anti-a-tubulin, Anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, and anti-b-actin antibodies (SantaCruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4uC. Blots werevisualized using IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse SecondaryAntibody (LI-COR Biotechnology, NE, USA). Detection wasperformed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-CORBiotechnology, NE, USA).Caspase-3,8,9 Colorimetric AssayThe activation of caspase-3,8,9 in the cells was measured withcolorimetric assay kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019sprotocol. The caspase activity was expressed as a fold increase oftest samples relative to non-treatment control.Con A-induced Hepatitis ModelHepatic damage was induced by a single intravenous injectionof Con A (15 mg/kg) into C57BL/6 mice. BE was administeredintraperitoneally (i.p.) (100 mg/kg) immediately after Con Ainjection. Control mice were given i.p. the same volume of solventinstead of BE. Blood samples were collected from mice at 0, 8, and24 h after Con A injection. Serum levels of alanine aminotransa-minase (ALT) were measured using a colorimetric assay kit(Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).Serum levels of IFN-c, TNF-a, and IL-4 were measured usingELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. For histological analysis, livers were collected at 24 h afterCon A injection. Liver samples were fixed in 10% formalinsolution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained withhematoxylin-eosin. To detect the in vivo apoptosis in lymphocytes,the liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes were isolated 24 hafter Con A injection as described previously [35], and stained fordifferent markers of cell subsets (CD3 and CD19) or with FITC-annexin/PI. The stained cells were counted using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. In some experiments, the liver MNCs andsplenocytes were harvested at 8 after Con A injection. The cellsobtained from each mouse were firstly cultured in 24-well flat-bottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophage adherence, then thenonadherent cells were collected and further cultured in vitro for 12and 24 h, and the percentages of apoptosis at each time point weredetermined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining.After 24 hours of in vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptoticcells in total nonadherent cells derived from liver MNCs andsplenocytes, as well as in CD3+T cell and CD19+B cell subsets,were measured by cell counting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-CD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-an-nexin V staining, respectively.Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis wasperformed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test,followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test. P valuesless than 0.05 were considered significant.ResultsBE Selectively Induces Apoptosis in Mitogen-activatedLymphocytesThe pro-apoptotic effect of BE was at first tested on splenocytes.To determine whether BE may exert differential effects onactivated and na\u0131\u0308ve immune cells, freshly isolated murinesplenocytes were cultured with BE (5\u201320 mM) for 24 h in thepresence or absence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and cell death wasdetermined using Annexin V/PI staining. The result revealed anincrease in the number of apoptotic events in splenocyte culturesupon BE treatment. Of note, the increase in the levels of apoptosisin splenocyte cultures containing both Con A and BE weremarkedly higher than that in the corresponding levels detected forthe same concentrations of BE when the cells were incubated withBE alone (Fig. 1). This result indicated that BE is more effective ininducing apoptosis in mitogen-activated splenocytes than in na\u0131\u0308veones.We next compared the abilities of BE to induced apoptosis indifferent types of immune cells under different activating status. Inthis experiment, CD3+cells and CD19+cells were purified frommurine splenocytes and were used as T and B lymphocytes,respectively. DCs were derived from murine BM cells andmacrophages were obtained from murine peritoneal exudate cells.Besides these primary immune cells, Jurkat T cell line andRAW264.7 cell line were also included in this experiment. Forinduction of cell activation, splenocytes and T lymphocytes werestimulated with 5 mg/ml of Con A; B lymphocytes, BM-derivedDCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were stimu-lated with 500 ng/ml of LPS; Jurkat T cells were stimulated with25 ng/mL of PMA plus 1 mM of ionomycin. All of these cells werecultured with 10 mM of BE for 24 h in the presence or absence ofthe respective activator and cell apoptosis was determined usingAnnexin V/PI staining. Because the spontaneous apoptosis levelswere different among various types of cells, the pro-apoptoticeffects of BE were indicated as increase in the percentages ofapoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure. As shown inFig. 2A, BE exposure resulted in a significantly higher increase inthe level of apoptosis in splenocytes, CD3+splenocytes, CD19+splenocytes, and Jurkat cells in the presence of activator comparedwith that in the absence of activator. However, BE, either alone orin the presence of LPS, only induced a slight and similar increaseof apoptosis in DCs, and induced almost no increase in peritonealmacrophages and RAW264.7 cells. This result suggested BE couldselectively induced the apoptosis in activated T and B lympho-cytes. We further determine the dose-dependency of BE inBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in LymphocytesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592inducing apoptosis of lymphocytes by incubating CD3+spleno-cytes, CD19+splenocytes, or Jurkat cells with increasing concen-trations of BE for 24 hours in the absence or presence of therespective activator and subsequently analyzing apoptosis. Theresults indicated BE enhanced the apoptosis of these tested cells ina dose-dependent manner within the range of 5\u201320 mM muchmore profoundly in the presence of activator than in the absenceof activator (Fig. 2B). Taken together, above results demonstratedthat activated T and B cells are more sensitive to BE-inducedapoptosis than na\u0131\u0308ve ones, whereas DCs and macrophages, eitheractivated or na\u0131\u0308ve, are insensitive to BE-induced apoptosis.BE Induces Apoptosis in Activated Lymphocytes throughMitochondrial PathwayIn order to dissect possible pathway involved in BE-inducedapoptosis in lymphocytes, we next investigated the effects of BE onthe expressions of Fas/FasL, loss of DYm, and activation ofcaspases in immunobead-purified CD3+splenocytes in the absenceor presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A. Consistent with the result inFig. 2B, BE (5\u201320 mM) markedly increased the percentage ofapoptotic (annexin V+) cells dose-dependently in the presence ofCon A, while only showing slight effects in the absence of Con A(Fig. 3 A\u2013C). At the same time, even though the presence of ConA resulted in a small increase in the expressions of Fas and FasL,they are not further affected by BE treatment (Fig. 3A, B, D, andE). However, BE treatment led to a much more profound loss ofDYm in T cells in the presence of Con A than in the absence ofCon A (Fig. 3F and G). With the loss of DYm, the release ofcytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol was markedlyincreased in T cells upon BE treatment in the presence of ConA (Fig. 3H). In addition, BE treatment also resulted in a down-regulation in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and anup-regulation in the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, in Tcells in the presence of Con A (Fig. 3I). The colorimetric assay forcaspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence of Con A,BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23 rather thancaspase-8 in T cells (Fig. 3J). These results not only confirmed theselectively pro-apoptotic effects of BE on activated T cells but alsoindicated that BE exerts it effects through mitochondrial pathwayrather than death-receptor-mediated pathway.We also tested the expressions of Fas and FasL in immunobead-purified CD19+splenocytes which were treated with increasingconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of10 mg/ml of LPS, and found that they were not influenced by BEtreatment (data not shown). However, flow cytometry analysisshowed that treatment with BE increased the percentage of cellswith low DYm (Fig. 4A and B) and active caspase-3+cells (Fig. 4Cand D) in CD19+cells much more profoundly in the presence ofLPS than in the absence of LPS. Western blotting assays showedthat the release of cytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol inB cells after BE treatment in the presence of LPS was markedincreased (Fig. 4E). BE treatment also resulted in a down-regulation in the levels of Bcl-2 and an up-regulation in the level ofBax in B cells in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4F). The colorimetricassay for caspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presenceof LPS, BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23rather than caspase-8 in B cells (Fig. 4G). These results furtherconfirmed BE selectively promotes apoptosis of activated B cellsthrough mitochondrial pathway.Administration of BE Attenuated Con A-inducedHepatitis and Enhanced Apoptosis of Lymphocytes inLiver-infiltrating MNCs and SplenocytesThe finding that BE selectively induces apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes in vitro prompted us to further investigate whether BEcould also induce lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has anti-hepatitis potential using a Con A-induced hepatitis model. Asshown in Fig. 5, intravenous administration of Con A resulted in asignificant elevation in the serum ALT level at 8 and 24 h afterCon A administration. BE treatment significantly reduced theALT concentrations at both time points (Fig. 5A). Serum levels ofIFN-c and TNF-a were also enhanced in response to Con Achallenge after 8 h, which were all suppressed by BE treatment(Fig. 5B). Histologic examination of liver sections showed that ConA challenge resulted in widespread areas of necrosis and massiveinfiltration of inflammatory cells in livers 24 h after Con Aadministration. Treatment with BE markedly attenuated thesepathologic changes (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry analysis of hepaticMNCs showed that the total numbers of liver infiltrating MNCs,CD3+T cells, and CD19+B cells were significantly lower in BE-treated mice, compared to mice treated with Con A only, 24 hoursFigure 1. BE preferentially induces apoptosis in mitogen-activated splennocytes. Murine splenocytes were treated with indicatedconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PIstaining.

(B) represents mean 6 SEM of three independent experiments. *P,0.05 versusuntreated controls.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069592.g001Baicalein Induces Apoptosis in LymphocytesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592after Con A injection (Fig. 5D). Hypothesizing that the reducednumbers of MNCs in the BE treated livers might reflect anincreased incidence of apoptosis, we analyzed the incidence ofapoptosis among the hepatic MNCs harvested at 24 h after Con Ainjection with flow cytometry and found that the frequency ofapoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs significantly increased uponBE treatment (Fig. 5E). Further flow cytometry analysis of freshlyisolated splenocytes demonstrated the percentages of apoptotic(Annexin V+) cells in splenocytes, splenic CD3+T cells, andCD19+B cell were significantly higher in BE-treated mice thanthat in mice received Con A only (Fig. 5F and G). However, wenoticed that the frequency of apoptosis in liver MNCs onlyincreased from 23.5% to 29.0% upon BE treatment (Fig. 5E),while the total cell numbers of liver MNCs dramatically decreasedfrom 21.86105 cells per liver decreased to 11.56105 cells per liverupon BE treatment (Fig. 5D). Thus the absolute number ofapoptotic MNCs was calculated to be fewer in BE-treated liverswhen compared to Con A only control. Nevertheless, it should benoted that, as cells undergo apoptosis, they are recognized andrapidly cleared in vivo by phagocytic macrophages [36,37]. Thus,the flow cytometry data in Fig. 5E did not take into considerationthe majority of the cells that had died and had been cleared in vivo,but only represented the incidence of apoptosis among liver MNCsthat were undergoing apoptosis but had not been cleared at thetime point that the cells were harvested (24 h after Con A and BEadministration). To overcome the problem of apoptotic cells beingcleared in vivo, we did ex vivo experiments in which we harvestedthe hepatic MNCs and splenocytes at early stage of BEadministration (within 8 h) and cultured them in 24-well flat-bottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophages adherence, then thenonadherent cells were collected and further cultured for 12 and24 h to investigate whether these cells would then undergoincreased apoptosis in vitro in the absence of macrophages. Theresults showed that during the in vitro culture period, the frequencyof apoptotic cells raised more readily in the macrophage-depletedlive MNCs and splenocytes obtained from mice treated with ConA and BE than in the cells from mice treated with Con A only, sothat by 24 h of in vitro culture, the increase in the frequency ofapoptotic cells in Con A+BE group became more apparentcompared with Con A only control (Fig. 6A). At this time point ofin vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells detected inmacrophage-depleted live MNCs and splenocytes, as well as inCD3+T cell and CD19+B cells subsets, were significantly higherin Con A+BE group than in Con A only control (Fig. 6B). Theseresults indicated that lymphocytes exposed to BE in vivo undergoincreased apoptosis when cultured in vitro, suggesting that in vivoexposure of lymphocytes to BE makes them more susceptible toapoptosis. These results support the notion that increased levels ofapoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction inMNCs within BE-treated livers. These data together suggestedthat BE could also promote lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and hasanti-hepatitis potential.Figure 2. BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes. (A) Different types of immune cells as indicated were incubated with10 mM of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of activator, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PI staining. Theincrease in the percentages of apoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure was calculated. Following activators were used: 5 mg/ml of Con A forsplenocytes and CD3+ splenocytes; 500 ng/ml of LPS for CD19+ splenocytes, BM-derived DCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells; 25 ng/mLof PMA and 1 mM of ionomycin for Jurkat T cells.

The directand selective pro-apoptotic effects on activated T and B cells werefurther corroborated using MACS-purified CD3+splenocytes andCD19+splenocytes. We demonstrated that BE significantlyenhanced the apoptosis in pure CD3+splenocytes stimulated withCon A, while only having little effect on naive ones. Consistently,BE was found to be much more effective in inducing Jurkat T cellsto undergo apoptosis in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. Inpure CD19+splenocytes cultures that had been treated with BEand LPS, the level of apoptosis were greater when compared tothat in cultures that treated with BE alone. These results confirmthat BE might affect activated lymphocytes to a greater degreethan na\u0131\u0308ve lymphocytes. We also noted that murine BM-derivedDCs, murine peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells wereall insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis, either activated orinactivated. These results suggested that BE was able to selectivepromote apoptosis in activated T and B lymphocytes.Apoptosis is mediated primarily through intrinsic and/orextrinsic pathways [38,39]. The intrinsic pathway involves alteringmitochondrial permeability and subsequent cytochrome c releaseand formation of the apoptosome, a catalytic multiproteinplatform that activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then cleavescaspase-3 resulting in downstream events involved in cell death[38]. The extrinsic pathway is triggered with the ligation of deathreceptors, followed by the recruitment of an adaptor molecule andprocaspase-8 to form a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex, whichlead to the autocatalytic cleavage and subsequent activation ofcaspase-8, and in turn activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis[39]. Fas is a major death receptor that mediates apoptosis ofactivated lymphocytes. Upon activation, lymphocytes can expressa higher level of Fas and are more susceptible to Fas-mediatedapoptosis than naive cells [7]. In this study, we observed that BEdid not affects the expressions of Fas and FasL on both T and Blymphocytes, either na\u0131\u0308ve or activated, but preferentially induced aloss of DYm in activated lymphocytes. BE treatment also led to therelease of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax in activatedlymphocytes. Furthermore, Caspase-9 and caspase-3 but notcaspase-8 were activated in activated lymphocytes upon BEtreatment. These results indicated that BE induces apoptosis inactivated lymphocytes via intrinsic pathway rather than Fas-mediated extrinsic pathway.BE has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties onvarious animal models [21\u201325], but the related mechanisms areonly partially understood. Previous studies have associated its anti-inflammatory activities with activation of intestinal Pregnane XReceptor [25], suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-sion [23,24], inhibition of nitric oxide production [21,40],impairment of reactive oxygen intermediates production [20],inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [20], andmodification of eicosanoid synthesis [41]. Data from current studysuggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of BE can also beattributed, at least in part, to its ability to trigger apoptosis inactivated lymphocytes. This new finding not only extends ourunderstanding on the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of BE, but also raises the possibility that BEmay be useful to eliminate activated lymphocytes that contributeto autoimmune diseases.Con A-induced hepatitis in mice is a well-established mousemodel for AIH. In this model, intravenous injection of Con Aleads to systemic immune activation, resulting in acute liver injurythat resemble the pathology of immune mediated hepatitis inhumans [10]. Activated T cells have a critical role in Con A-induced liver damage. Upon Con A challenge, T cells are initiallyactivated and infiltrate the liver tissue, where they inducehepatocyte death either by cell to cell contact or through secretionof pro-inflammatory cytokines, of which TNF-a and IFN-c are themajor ones [42,43]. In the current study, in vivo administration ofBE alleviated Con A-induced hepatitis as indicated by decreasedtransaminase levels and markedly attenuated inflammatory lesionsin liver. BE treatment also significantly suppressed Con A-mediated elevation in serum level of TNF-a and IFN-c, indicatingCon A-induced immune activation was inhibited by BE.Furthermore, BE treatment markedly reduced MNCs infiltrationin the liver and significantly lowered the absolute number ofhepatic T and B lymphocytes. The reduction in hepatic MNCscould possibly result from the decrease in MNCs recruitment intolivers and/or the increase in MNCs death and clearance withinlivers. Since BE can selectively induced apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes in vitro, we assumed that enhanced apoptosis oflymphocytes may contribute to the reduction of MNCs in livers ofBE-treated mice. Indeed, we found that BE treatment increasedthe incidence of apoptosis among hepatic MNCs and splenocytesin Con A-challenged mice. Flow cytometry assay of annexin Vexposure in splenic T and B cells further confirmed that thefrequency of splenic T and B lymphocytes undergoing apoptosiswas increased in ConA-injected mice upon BE treatment.Furthermore, our ex vivo experiments demonstrated that whenliver MNCs and splenocytes harvested from mice treated with ConA and BE were cultured in vitro for 24 h, both the frequencies ofapoptosis and the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells in total liverMNCs and spelnocytes, as well as in CD3+T cell and CD19+Bcell subsets, were significantly higher when compared to Con Aonly control. These ex vivo data indicate that lymphocytes from BE-treated mice become increasingly susceptible to apoptosis whencultured in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that higher level ofapoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction ofMNCs in liver of BE-treated mice, which concur with in vitroevidence that BE drives activated lymphocytes to apoptosis.Although we cannot exclude the possibility that BE may executeFigure 3.

Itwould be expected that the oral delivery of BE may have limitedutility since the oral bioavailability of BE is very low. Therefore,the present in vivo study only shows proof of principle, but does notshow any practical utility of the BE in clinic.Currently the only viable treatments of AIH are immunosup-pressant application and liver transplantation [1,3]. Ideally, thegoal of immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune diseaseswould be the induction of long-lasting immunological tolerance byselective deleting autoantigen-activated lymphocytes that havefailed to undergo apoptosis while leaving the normal immuneresponse to foreign antigens unaffected. Unfortunately, mostimmunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) currently used for AIH actmainly by preventing the activation and expansion of restinglymphocytes, rather than mediating the elimination of activatedafter BE treatment in the presence of LPS was examined by Western blotting.

On the contrary, some ISDs such ascyclosporin A and FK506 even inhibited apoptosis in activated Tcells by down-regulation of FasL [47]. Although dexamethasone isknown to induce apoptosis in various immune cells, it lack ofselectivity for activated lymphocytes [48]. This is why the currentISDs exert global suppressing effects on the immune system, whichpredispose patients to the development of infection and cancer.Alternatively, selective induction of apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes might effectively deplete autoreactive T and B cellswithout affecting na\u0131\u0308ve or non-activated ones to avoid interventionof normal immune responses to foreign antigens. In this context,BE would have distinct advantages over the unselective immuno-suppressive agents currently used in the treatment of AIH.However, the practical uses of baicalein in pharmaceutical fieldwill depend on the success of attempts to enhance its oralbioavailability. Fortunately, several approaches have been recentlydeveloped which could markedly improve the oral bioavailabilityof BE [49\u201351].In conclusion, BE selectively promoted apoptosis in activatedlymphocytes through intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while havinglittle effect on non-activated ones. Administration of BE alleviatesCon A-induced hepatitis in mice and increased the incidences ofapoptosis in hepatic MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3+and CD19+splenocytes, in Con A-challenged mice. Theseobservations not only reveal a novel cellular mechanism for theanti-inflammatory effects of BE, but also suggest that it hastherapeutic potential for AIH.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: YZ LS YH WZ ZH.
