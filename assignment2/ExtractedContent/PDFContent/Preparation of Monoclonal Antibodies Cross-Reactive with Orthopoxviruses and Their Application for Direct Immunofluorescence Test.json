"Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies Cross\u2010Reactive with Orthopoxviruses and Their Application for Direct Immunofluorescence TestSmallpox outbreaks have occurred from time to timefor thousands of years, but this infectious disease innature is now eradicated after a successful worldwidevaccination program.  The last naturally occurring casein the world was in Somalia in 1977.  Variola virus(smallpox virus) caused smallpox infection.  Except forlaboratory stockpiles, the variola virus has been elimi-nated.  However, there is heightened concern that thevariola virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorismor biowarfare.  Therefore, the government of eachcountry is taking precautions for dealing with a small-pox outbreak.  Smallpox is a serious, contagious, andsometimes fatal disease.  Although the only preventionis vaccination, routine vaccination among the generalpublic was stopped.  There is no specific treatment forthe smallpox disease.Confirmation of a smallpox outbreak requires diag-nosis.  Laboratory diagnostic testing for the variolavirus has been conducted by serological assays, negativestain electron microscopy (EM) identification, or isola-tion of the variola virus from a clinical specimen.Recently, diagnosis has been performed by polymerasechain reaction (PCR) (2, 4, 16, 22), restriction fragmentlength polymorphism (19), microarrays (17) and thesequencing (23) of viral DNA.  Genetic diagnosis has ahigh sensitivity and specificity, but might be costly,complicated and time-consuming.  In contrast, the sero-logical assay may be more rapid and simple than thePreparation of Monoclonal Antibodies Cross-Reactive with Orthopoxviruses and TheirApplication for Direct Immunofluorescence TestNoritoshi Kitamoto*, 1, Takayuki Kobayashi1, Yoji Kato1, Nobutaka Wakamiya2, KazuyoshiIkuta3, Tomoyuki Tanaka4, Shigeharu Ueda3, Hiroyuki Miyamoto5, and Shiro Kato31School of Human Science and Environment, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo 670\u20130092, Japan, 2Asahikawa Medical Col-lege, Asahikawa, Hokkaido 078\u20138510, Japan, 3Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka565\u20130871, Japan, 4Sakai City Institute of Public Health, Sakai, Osaka 590\u20130953, Japan, and 5Osaka Prefecture Saiseikai-Sen-nan Medical Welfare Center, Sennan, Osaka 590\u20130535, JapanReceived June 29, 2004; in revised form, December 7, 2004. Accepted December 20, 2004Abstract: Variola virus (smallpox virus), vaccinia virus (VV), cowpox virus (CPV) and ectromelia virus(EV) belong to the genus Orthopoxvirus of the family Poxviridae. To establish the possible diagnosis forsmallpox infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VV and CPV were produced. The cross-reac-tivity of seven MAbs with cells infected with various strains of the orthopoxviruses (CPV, VV and EV) wasconfirmed by an immunofluorescence (IF) test and other immunological analyses. Four and three MAbsreacted with the common antigen of all poxviruses (probably NP antigen) and the antigen involved in neu-tralization, respectively. We developed the IF test using these MAbs. The direct IF test required only 45min to perform. Smallpox infection is now eradicated, but it is important to prepare for the diagnosis ofsmallpox in an emergency. The direct IF assay using MAbs cross-reactive with orthopoxviruses is rapid,simple, specific, applicable for multiple samples, and will make it possible to screen for and detectorthopoxviruses that include variola virus with tissue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-tories or institutes.Key words: Monoclonal antibody, Smallpox, Rapid diagnosis, Cross-reactivity219Microbiol.

Several majorantigens have been shown to be induced in cells infectedwith CPV and VV, i.e., the nucleoprotein (NP) antigen(24, 29), neutralization (NT)-associated antigen (21)and A-type inclusions (ATI) (7\u20139).  We have identifiedthe polypeptides of the major antigens by immunopre-cipitation (IP) with polyclonal antibodies (5, 6) andidentified those antigens by IP and immunoblotting(western blotting, WB) with a monoclonal antibody(MAb) (11\u201313).  The NP is a so-called common antigenthat shows cross-reactivity with cells infected witheither an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV, or aLeporipoxvirus such as the Shope fibroma virus (SFV).The NT antigen shows cross-reactivity with cells infect-ed with the Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV.On the other hand, the ATI are seen in cells infectedonly with an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV or EV.In this study, we newly produced MAbs cross-reactedwith the orthopoxviruses, and examined the develop-ment of simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic screeningfor the multiple tissue impression smears infected withorthopoxviruses that include the smallpox virus.Materials and MethodsViruses and cells.  RK13 cells derived from rabbitkidney cells, HeLa cells derived from a human carcino-ma and L cells derived from mouse fibroblasts weregrown in minimum essential medium supplementedwith 5% calf serum (MEM-CS).  The strains of CPVwere the LB red, Amsterdam, 53, 58 and 60 strains, theEV strains were Ishibashi and Hampstead, the VVstrains were Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-J, and theSFV strain was OA (5, 6, 11\u201313).  The RK13 or HeLacells were infected with CPV, VV or SFV, and theHeLa or L cells were infected with EV.  Tissue samplesinfected with Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV)were kindly provided by Dr.  Kenji Hiroi (Hiroi Derma-tologic Hospital, Osaka, Japan).Production of hybridoma.  The methods for the pro-duction and culture of the hybridomas and the screeningprocedures for the antibodies have been previouslydescribed (11).  Hybridomas were obtained from thecultures of PAI myeloma cells fused with spleen cellsfrom BALB/c mice immunized with cells infected withthe LB red strain of CPV, or Ikeda strain or Lister strainof VV.  The obtained ascites fluids as previouslydescribed (12) were used as MAbs.  The subclasses ofthese antibodies were determined by immunodiffusionwith a hybridoma cell lysate and class-specificimmunoglobulin antisera as described by Volk et al.(27).Immunofluorescence (IF) test. The direct and indirect(IF) test was carried out with cells infected with eachvirus at 2 to10 PFU (plaque-forming unit)/ml culturedfor 24 hr after infection and fixed with cold acetone.For the membrane IF (MIF) test, cells infected and cul-tured were used without fixation.  The FITC (fluoresceinisothiocyanate isomer I, Becton Dicknson & Co.,U.S.A.)-conjugation with antibody can be performedusing the methods of Kawamura et al.  (10). Briefly, theantibody (ascites) was concentrated with a saturatedsolution of ammonium sulfate and dialyzed with 0.85%NaCl buffer (pH 7.0).  The FITC was dissolved with500 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5), added toproduce a ratio of 10\u201340 \u00b5g/mg of antibody solution,and immediately mixed.  The mixture was incubatedand rotated at room temperature for 2 hr.  The unreactedFITC or MAb was removed by gel filtration ofSephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden)column chromatography, and then DEAE (diethyl-aminoethyl)-cellulose ion exchange chromatography(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto).  The F/P (1:2) ratio wasdetermined by measuring the absorbance at 280 and495 nm.  This FITC-labeled MAb was used for direct IFtest.Serological analyses.  For the NT test, about 200PFU/ml of virus was incubated for 60 min at 37 C withfourfold serial dilutions of MAbs in MEM-CS.  Thevirus-antibody sample was adsorbed to RK13 or HeLacells for 60 min at 37 C. After 48 to 64 hr of incubationat 37 C, plaques were visualized by staining with0.13% crystal violet in 2% ethanol.  The titer of theantibodies was determined as the reciprocal of the high-est fourfold dilution neutralizing 50% of the PFU.  TheIP assay has been described in detail elsewhere (11).The WB techniques with MAbs by the method of Tow-bin et al. (26) with slight modifications have beendescribed in detail elsewhere (11).ResultsEstablishment and Characterization of MAbsSeven MAbs were obtained from mice immunizedwith the CPV (LB red strain)- or the VV (Ikeda or Lis-ter strain)-infected cells.  The specificities and the cross-reactivities of these antibodies with cells infected withvarious strains of CPV, VV, EV and SFV were exam-ined by IF, IP, WB and several biological and serologi-cal analyses.  The antibodies reacting with the knownmajor antigens, i.e., the common antigen of allpoxviruses, probably involved the NP and NT antigen.220 N. KITAMOTO ET ALSeven MAbs were characterized and classified intothree groups according to their IF, IP and WB analyses.Results of the reactivities of the seven MAbs directedagainst common antigens are summarized in Table 1and are described below in detail.Three MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in thegroup A reacted with the CPV strains (LB red, Amster-dam, 53, 58 and 60), EV strains (Ishibashi and Hamp-stead) and VV strains (Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-J).  MAbs C1321 and C8911 clones were derived frommice immunized with the LB red strain of CPV, and theMAb V1141 clone was obtained from mice immunizedwith the Ikeda strain of VV.  MAbs C1321 and C8911were isotype IgG1, and MAb V1141 was isotype IgG3.All of these MAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EVand VV by the IF test (Table 1), and with granular pat-terns at the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1a).  TheseMAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EV and VV byIP and WB (Table 1), and with a polypeptide band ofmolecular weight 65,000 (65 K) in the infected cells(Fig. 2).  These MAbs also reacted with the SFV of thegenus Leporipoxviridae (OA strain) in the IF test.These antibodies gave negative reactions in the NT andMIF tests, and with MCV-, measles virus (Edmonstonstrain)-, herpes simplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infect-ed cells.On the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B) reactedwith a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with two polypep-tides of 65 K and 40 K on WB (Fig. 2), and gave a pinspot-like cytoplasmic fluorescent staining pattern (Fig.1b).  The cross-reactivity of C4413 with each virus andwith the 65 K polypeptide was the same as those ofgroup A. However, the IF staining and polypeptide pat-terns of MAb C4413 appeared to be different fromthese of the clones in group A.The C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-ing activity and each NT titer was 1,024 to 4,096 (Table1).  The C3716 clone was established from mice immu-nized with the LB red strain of CPV, and the V1141and V1771 clones were established from mice immu-nized with the Ikeda strain and Lister strain of VV,respectively.  These MAbs reacted with 28 K polypep-tides on IP and on WB (Fig. 2).  These antibodies gavepositive reactions with cells infected with CPV, EV orVV, but not with SFV in the IF and WB.  The reactionwas positive in the MIF test.  These antibodies gavenegative reactions with MCV-, measles virus-, herpessimplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infected cells.  The IFstaining by these antibodies was surface and cytoplas-mic diffuse (Fig. 1c).Possibility of Rapid Diagnosis Using MAbsThe direct IF test using the FITC-labeled MAbsshortens the time needed for the procedures.  Two typesof MAbs, V1141 (anti-NP) and VL101 (anti-NT) werechosen for development of the serological detection221ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIESTable 1.

The smear of infectedcells was fixed with cold acetone for 5 min.  The FITC-labeled MAb was dropped on the smear and incubatedfor 30 min at 37 C. The smear was then washed withPBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.0) and mountedwith glycerin for fluorescence microscopic examina-tion.  This procedure takes only 45 min.  The FITC-labeled V1141 showed granular patterns at the cyto-plasm of infected cells (Fig. 1e), and cross-reactedwith cells infected with CPV, VV, EV and SFV.  Thelabeled VL101 showed a surface diffuse pattern at thecytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1f), and cross-reactedwith cells infected with CPV, VV and EV.DiscussionThree MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in group Arecognized a common antigen in all the poxviruses(probably NP antigen, although this has not beenabsolutely established), since they both reacted with the65 K polypeptide (6, 11) and cross-reacted with all thepoxvirus-infected cells (29).  We also found that the 65K polypeptide was detected by the WB of CPV virionspurified from infected cells (data not shown).  Wilton etal. (28) reported several MAbs against VV which recog-nized the core complex components and reacted withcytoplasmic inclusions (called B-type inclusions) widelyranging in size.  The possibility is that the NP proteinsare highly immunogenic antigens.  The NP antigen isassociated with the B-type inclusions, and not with ATI(9).  On the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B)reacted with a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with twopolypeptides of 65 K and 40 K on WB.  This wasexamined by peptide mapping experiments involving222 N.

Characteristic appearance of indirect (a\u2013d) and direct (e, f) immunofluorescence (IF) test after staining of CPV(cowpox virus)-infected RK13 cells with each monoclonal antibody (MAb). The cells infected with CPV (LB redstrain) were smeared and fixed with cold acetone for 5 min. For indirect IF test (a\u2013d), MAb was added as the firstantibody and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. After washing with PBS, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (CappelLab., Westchester, Penn., U.S.A.) as the second antibody was reacted for 30 min at 37 C.

The peptide pattern of the 65 Kpolypeptide reacting with C4413 was different fromthat recognized by clones of group A. The cross-reactiv-ity of C4413 with each virus and with the 65 Kpolypeptide was the same as those of group A. Howev-er, the IF staining and polypeptide patterns of MAbC4413 appeared to be different from these of the clonesin group A.The C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-ing activity.  These MAbs recognizing an envelope pro-tein of VV have been reported to show neutralizingactivity and to react with the 14 K polypeptide (27) orthe 28\u201329 K polypeptide (14, 20).  The C3716 clonewas established from mice immunized with the LB redstrain of CPV, and the V1141 and V1771 clones wereestablished from mice immunized with the Ikeda strainand Lister strain of VV, respectively.  These antibodiescross-reacted with cells infected with each strain ofCPV and VV.  Therefore, the 28 K polypeptide associ-ated with neutralization shows a high degree of proteinconservation in the Orthopoxvirus genus.The final aim of this study was to establish a diagno-sis of the smallpox infection.  The IF test using MAbswas examined for the detection of the orthopoxviruses.Although the methods using PCR and EM were alreadyavailable for detecting poxvirus, the IF test using MAbsmight be no less specific than PCR and EM.  Also, theIF test is simpler, manageable at a lower cost andapplicable for more samples than the PCR and EMdiagnoses.  In the indirect IF test, MAbs will be used asthe primary antibodies for the detection of the poxvirusantigen in fresh tissue impression smears.  This assayrequired only 2\u20133 hr to detect the viral antigen.  TheELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay),immunochromatography and microarray assays usingMAbs might also be rapid and capable ways of detect-ing the virus in tissue samples.  In preliminary study,ELISA using our MAbs will make it possible to detectthe orthopoxviruses.  However, a treated or solubilizedantigen sample has to be prepared.  In contrast, in the IFtest, only fresh tissue impression smears from skinlesions will serve this purpose.  In our preliminarystudy, we determine that the direct IF test will prove tobe sensitive and reliable against infected tissues of labo-ratory animal.  BALB/c mice were infected intramuscu-larly or intracutaneously with Lister strains of VV.Three or 4 days later, tissue impression smear sampleswere obtained from vesicular or pustular lesions andexamined with the direct IF test.  The MAbs NT1 andNP1 showed clear positive reactions as well as tissueculture infected cells.  It is important to prepare for the223ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIESFig. 2. Western blot (WB) of polypeptides from CPV (cowpox virus)- and VV (vaccinia virus)-infected RK13 cellsreacting with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The results shown are for MAbs, C1321, V1141, C4413, C3716,V1771, VL101 and ATI (as a control), and for antigen, LB red strain of CPV (C) and Lister strain of VV (V). Pro-teins in the cells were boiled for 2 min, lysed with sample buffer (about 10 to 20 \u00b5g/well) and SDS-PAGE was con-ducted in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets which were incu-bated overnight at room temperature with the indicated MAbs (at 1:1,000 dilution of ascites), and then incubated withhorseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Lab.) for 1 hr at 37 C and treated with sub-strate (4-chloro-1-naphthol). Calibration kits were used for the molecular weight determination (M); numbers on theleft side indicate the apparent molecular weight (\ufffd1,000). Each MAb reacted with all strains of the genusOrthopoxvirus, with the major polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 65 K, 40 K or 28 K.rapid diagnosis of smallpox in an emergency.  Thedirect IF test requires only 45 min to perform and multi-ple samples can be tested at one time.Relationships between poxviruses were evaluated bycomparing the genome size, number of unique genes,gene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of proteinsequences (3).  Genus Avipoxvirus is the most diver-gent.  The next most divergent is Molluscipoxvirus,whose sole member, MCV, infects only man.  Withinthe genus Orthopoxvirus, monkeypox virus, EV, CPVand VV are closely related to variola virus and are dis-tinct from SFV of the genus Leporipoxvirus. Immuno-fluorescence staining technique using polyclonal anti-bodies has been examined (15, 25).  The results indicat-ed high sensitivity for the IF test in diagnosing variolamajor, but also showed a high rate of false-positiveresults (25).  Our previous study, hyper immune mousesera to VV showed faint positive reactions with MCV,which has low homology to orthopoxviruses.  OurMAbs did not react in the least with MCV.  Theseresults suggest that MAbs are more specific fororthopoxviruses.It has been reported that MAbs reactive against eachof the five outer layer proteins neutralized infectivity(20).  Several neutralization epitopes were also mappedto within the short consensus repeat domain (18).  Fur-ther studies are necessary to define the molecular loca-tion of these epitopes recognized with our MAbs, and toexamine the reaction to synthetic peptides homologousto variola virus.  Although we actually cannot attempt todevelop human samples, it is also necessary to demon-strate that these MAbs react with infected cells withmonkeypox virus belonging to the same genus.  It isimportant to take measures to deal with the situationand to prepare for the diagnosis of smallpox in an emer-gency.  The direct IF test using MAbs is a rapid, simpleand useful routine screening for multiple samples of tis-sue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-tories or institutes.  These are the major advantages ofthe assay developed in this study.  Virus isolation, PCRor EM examination could be used as a definite diagnosisfor smallpox infection.We thank Eriko Goto, Kenzi Hiroi and Satoru Tanimoto,members of the Department of Microbiology, Wakayama Med-ical College, for their help with this work.References1) Cleveland, D.W., Fischer, S.G., Kirschener, M.W., andLaemmli, U.K. 1977.
