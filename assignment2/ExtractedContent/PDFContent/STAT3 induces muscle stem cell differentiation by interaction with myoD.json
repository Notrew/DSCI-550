IntroductionMuscle stem cells, also known as myoblasts, are normally pres-ent as quiescent satellite cells between the basement membraneand the plasma membrane of myofibrils [1]. In response to injury,exercise or in pathogenic states, they become activated, re-entercell cycle and start to proliferate actively. Eventually, these prolif-erating satellite cells irreversibly withdraw from cell cycles, differ-entiate and fuse with existing myofibrils [2]. These sequentialevents are called muscle regeneration. In this process, the differen-tiation of myoblasts is controlled by two families of transcriptionfactors, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte enhan-cer-binding factor 2(MEF2s) [3], which are regulated by a varietyof growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), leuke-mia inhibitory factor (LIF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basicfibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF), and transforming growth factor-a [4]. In addition, manysignaling pathways, such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STATsare involved in the regulation of myoblasts differentiation. LIFll rights reserved.2 (K. Ma).Sun), mkwyypxy@163.comthe paper.in writing the paper.er.ed results.belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, which is se-creted by multiple cell types and mediates a variety of biologicaleffects depending on the target tissue and cell lineage. The intra-cellular signaling pathways responsible for LIF action involve theactivation of Jak and/or Tyk kinases. Activated Jak/Tyk phosphory-lates (signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1,STAT3 or STAT5) can translocates into the nucleus and transacti-vate LIF-responsive genes.STAT proteins transduce pivotal biological effects of variouscytokines and hormones [5]. Among seven STAT family members(STAT1-4, 5A, 5B, and 6), STAT3 is activated by several cytokines,such as the IL-6 family (LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatinM, IL-11, and cardiotrophin-1), IGF-I, HGF, EGF, PDGF, and bFGF.Thus, STAT3 plays a central role in the regulation of growth, differ-entiation, and survival in many types of cells [6]. For example,STAT3 promotes cell growth through the transcriptional regulationof cyclin D1 in fibroblasts [7] and through the transcriptional reg-ulation of c-myc and Pim1 in hematopoietic cell lines [8\u20139]. Inaddition, STAT3 maintains embryonic stem cells in an undifferen-tiated state [10] and inhibits IL-6-induced neuronal differentiationin PC12 cells [11]. These data indicate that STAT3 promotes cellgrowth and suppresses cell differentiation. However, STAT3 hasbeen reported to mediate cytokine-induced terminal differentia-tion in other cell types, such as IL-6-induced macrophage differen-tiation [12], CD40 ligand-induced B-cell differentiation [13],OSM-induced differentiation of an osteosarcoma cell line [14],ciliary neurotrophic factor or OSM-induced astrocyte differentia-tion [15,16], and LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation in car-diac stem cells [17]. Therefore, the role of STAT3 in cell growthmailto:sunluguo@yahoo.com.cnmailto:mkwyypxy@163.comhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666138 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141and differentiation is divergent according to the cellular back-ground and/or the type of cytokines.However, the function of STAT3 signal pathway in regulatingmyogenesis still remains largely unknown. As a transcriptionalfactor, STAT3 mediates several biological functions including pro-liferation, differentiation, and survival of myoblasts via activatingits target genes (cyclin D1, c-fos, JunB, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) [18\u201329],either by directly binding to regulatory region of target genes orby interacting with other transcriptional factors. It has also beenreported that the intrinsic muscle-specific transcriptional factors,such as MyoD, MEF2 and SIX1, play crucial roles in skeletal muscledevelopment in coordination with exogenous growth factors dur-ing myogenesis. Thus, it is necessary to demonstrate whetherSTAT3 can induce myogenic differentiation by interacting withMyoD, MEF2 or SIX1. MyoD is known to regulate myogenic differ-entiation through its transcriptional activities and protein\u2013proteininteractions, leading to cell cycle arrest and myoblast differentia-tion at the early phase. MEF2 is also capable of directly interactingwith members of the MRFs (i.e., MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, andMRF4) to synergistically activate many muscle-specific genes[30,31]. The human SIX1, a member of the SIX classes of homeodo-main genes, is such a transcription factor functioning as a masterregulatory protein and transactivating the MEF3 site containingreporter genes, such as myogenin [32].To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therole of STAT3 in myogenic differentiation, we examined whetherthe STAT3 protein interacts with these key myogenic regulatoryfactors. We elucidated the role of STAT3 signal pathway duringmyogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells, an immortalized myo-genic cell line derived from mouse MSCs [37]. Our results con-firmed that STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation. LIFmediates muscle cell differentiation by JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Inaddition, STAT3 may also induce myogenin differentiation throughbiding to another transcription factor, MyoD. These results pro-vided a molecular basis for further understanding of the muscleregeneration mechanism.2. Methods2.1. Cell culturesMouse MSC-derived C2C12 cells (American Type Culture collec-tion, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modifiedEagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 20% fetal bovine serum (referredto herein after as growth medium or GM), 100 U/ml penicillin,and 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a 37 \ufffdC incubator with 5% CO2 forproliferation. To induce differentiation, growth medium wassubstituted by differentiation medium (Dulbecco\u2019s modifiedEagle\u2019s medium containing 2% horse serum, or DM) when cellswere near confluent to allow the cells permanently withdraw fromcell cycles, differentiate and fuse into myotube.2.2. Reagents and antibodiesLIF was purchased from Chemicon, AG490 from Biomol, HGFfrom AMS/Immunoko ntact, and bFGF from Invitrogen. Antibodiesused include the mouse monoclonal antibodies to actin (Sigma),JAK1 (Santa Cruz), STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT3 (Cell SignalingTechno logy), MHC (MF20, Developmental studies hybridomabank), MyoD (Phar Mingen), Flag (m2, Sigma).2.3. Plasmid construction and transfectionVarious expression vectors for Flag-tagged MyD, Flag-taggedSIX1 or Flag-tagged MEF2 were constructed by inserting PCR-gen-erated cDNA fragments into the mammalian expression vectors ofpcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All constructed clones were verified bysequencing. In DM 12 h, 5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto12-well plates to reach 70\u201380% confluence and were transfectedwith 200 ng of various plasmids as indicated in the figure legendsusing LipofectAMINE 2000 (Sigma) in according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions. At 48 h after transfection, cells were extractedfor coimmunoprecipitation analysis followed by Western blotanalysis.2.4. siRNA and transfectionAll Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized at Dharm-acon Inc. Sequences were as follows: for the STAT3 siRNA (human,sense), 50GAGUCCAAUGUCCU CUAUC; for the unrelated to STAT3-RNAi, 50AGACUUGACACUUCUCG CU; In GM or in DM 36 h,5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto 12-well plates to reach70\u201380% confluence. Then cells were transfected with various siR-NAs of 100 nmol/L as indicated in the figure legends using LipofectAMINE 2000. At 48 h after transfection, cells in DM 36 h were ex-tracted for Western blot analysis, while cells in GM were treatedwith LIF (20 ng/ml) for 12 h before Western blot analysis.2.5. CoimmunoprecipitationTo examine the protein\u2013protein interaction in cultured C2C12cells,C2C12 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4,150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Four mil-ligrams of anti-Flag antibody was first incubated with 300 lg ofcell extracts in RIPA buffer overnight at 4 \ufffdC with rotation; 30 llof protein A-Sepharose beads was then added, and the mixturewas incubated at 4 \ufffdC for 1 h with rotation. After extensive wash-ing with the RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted out by boilingthen subjected to Western blot analysis.2.6. Western blot analysisTo examine expression levels of myosin heavy chain(MHC),stat3, phosphorylated-STAT3, b-actin, MyoD, Flag-myoD, Flag-MEF2, Flag-SIX1 and JAK1, C2C12 cells lysates in RIPA buffer wascentrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC and the supernatantwas used for the experiment. An aliquot (50 lg) of protein wasseparated by 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)and electrotransferred onto 0.2-Am nitrocellulose membrane usingTowbin transfer buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 20% metha-nol, pH 8.3). The membrane was preincubated with PBS containing5% milk, and probed with monoclonal anti-MHC (1:1000), mono-clonal anti-actin (1:1000), monoclonal anti-STAT3, monoclonalanti-phosphorylated-STAT3 (1:1000), monoclonal anti-MyoD(1:1000), monoclonal anti-Flag, and monoclonal anti-JAK1(1:1000), in PBS containing 5% milk for 1h at room temperature.The membrane was then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween20 and incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase(HP)-conjugated secondary antibody. After several washes, the blotwas developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent(ECL, sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.3. Results3.1. STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiationTo identify signal pathway involved in differentiation process ofmyogenesis, we examined the expression of STAT3 proteins inC2C12 myoblast when the C2C12 myoblast was shifted from GMFig. 2. LIF induced rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in C2C12 cells. The expression ofphosphorylated-stat3 increased when treated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h com-pared with HGF (20 ng/ml) or bFGF (20 ng/ml) (the top panel). The expression levelsof the endogenous JAK1 protein or endogenous stat3 protein were revealed byWestern blot (WB) as indicated (the top and center panel). Vacant: no any disposalsas a vacant control.Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141 139to DM for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of STAT3 andphosphorylated-STAT3 proteins increased upon differentiation,i.e., after the cells were transferred from GM to DM. To furtheridentify the role of STAT3 in myogenin differentiation, we knockeddown the endogenous STAT3 with small interference RNA in C2C12cells cultured in DM for 36 h (Fig. 1B). Compared to the controlcells, the myogenic differentiation was markedly blocked inSTAT3-siRNA-transfected cells, as demonstrated by Western blotshowing the decreased expression of differentiation marker pro-tein\u2014myosin heavy chain (MHC). These results suggest that Stat3plays a critical role in the process of myogenesis differentiation.3.2. LIF induces rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in C2C12 cellsThe progresses of muscle regeneration are regulated by a vari-ety of growth factors such as LIF, HGF, and bFGF [33,34]. Therefore,we next examined which cytokines that activate STAT3 duringmuscle differentiation. The C2C12 myoblast cells grown in theGM were treated with LIF (20 ng/ml), HGF (20 ng/ml), or bFGF(20 ng/ml). Although the expression levels of endogenous JAK1protein or endogenous stat3 protein were comparable betweencytokine-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2; top and center panels),the levels of phosphorylated-STAT3 proteins were significantly in-creased in LIF-treated cells compared to those treated with HGF orbFGF (top panel). These results indicate that LIF activates STAT3 byinducing rapid phosphorylation of STAT3.3.3. Jak2 mediates the effect of LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylationduring myogenic differentiationTo test whether Jak2 is the down-stream protein of LIF to acti-vate STAT3 during normal myogenic differentiation, we assessedthe effect of a specific Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, on STAT3 activationby LIF in C2C12 cells that has been induced to differentiate inDM for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 3, in differentiated C1C12 cells,LIF-induced stat3 phosphorylation was repressed by pretreatmentwith AG490 in a dose-dependent manner. AG490 pretreatmentalso significantly inhibited myogenic differentiation as indicatedby decreased expression of Myosin heavy chain (MHC). Theseresults demonstrate that LIF-induced differentiation of myogenesisthrough the signal pathway of JAK2/STAT3.3.4.

We transfected C2C12 cells with Flag-six1, Flag-MEF2, or Flag-myoD when the cells were cultured in DM for12 h. Proteins were prepared from the transfected cells, and ana-lyzed by coimmunoprecipitation using a flag-specific antibodyand Western blot with an anti-stat3 antibody (Fig. 4; the toppanel). As shown in Fig. 4 (the second top panel), stat3 proteinwas detected in the cells transfected Flag-myoD, but not in thosetransfected with Flag-MEF2 or Flag-six1. The data indicate thatmyoD, but not MEF2 or six1, can directly interact with stat3 inmyogenic differentiation.4. DiscussionIt is important to understand the molecular mechanisms regu-lating muscle regeneration, a process involving proliferation, dif-ferentiation, and survival of myoblasts. STAT3, a well-knownfactor for its critical roles in transducing various and importantbiological effects [5], has been found to be expressed in muscle,but its role during muscle differentiation is poorly defined. Byusing C2C12 cell-based in vitro muscle differentiation model, wefirst proved that both the expression level and activation of STAT3increase upon C2C12 cells differentiation. We also showed thatLIF-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signal transduction pathway inducesmyogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we found that STAT3 coulddirectly interact with myoD, suggesting that myoD might be in-volved in STAT3-induced myogenic differentiation.Fig. 3. Jak2 specially mediated the effect of STAT3 during myogenic differentiation.AG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor, was able to inhibit STAT3 activation induced by LIF.After cells were pretreated with AG490 in a dose-dependent manner as indicatedfor 30 min and then treated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, the level of expression ofphosphorylated-stat3 (the top panel) decreased. And the differentiation of the cellswas determined by examining the expression of MHC protein as indicated (thecenter panel).Fig. 4. STAT3 bonded with myoD in the stage of differentiation. C2C12 cell wererespectively transfected with Flag-six1, Flag- MEF2 or Flag-myoD. Twelve hoursafter transfection, cells extracts were subjected to coimmunoprecipitated withantibodies against anti-Flag antibody. First the immunoprecipitated (IP) Flag-six1,Flag-MEF2, Flag-myoD were detected by Western blot (WB) with anti-Flag antibody(the top panel).The transfected plasmids all existed in the cells. Next, the cellslysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against stat3 (the second top panel).Stat3 protein was detected only in the cells transfected Flag-myoD. Furthermore,the cells lysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against endogenous stat3 orendogenous actin. The levels of the endogenous stat3 and endogenous actin wereequal revealed by WB (two bottom panels).140 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141The role for STAT3 in myoblast differentiation was further con-firmed by STAT3 knockdown experiment using siRNA, in whichdeliberate knockdown of endogenous STAT3 dramatically blockedmyogenic differentiation. The role of STAT3 in cell growth and dif-ferentiation is divergent according to the cellular background, thetype of cytokines that activates STAT3 and the type of nuclear pro-teins that interacts with STAT3. It has been reported that STAT3induces differentiation in some cell lines such as macrophage,B-cell, osteosarcoma cell line, astrocyte and cardiac stem cells[12\u201317], but suppresses differentiation and promotes cell growthin others [7\u201311].We observed that LIF-activated JAK2/STAT3 induces myogenicdifferentiation. However, a previous report showed that LIF-med-iated ERK phosphorylation inhibits myogenic differentiation [35].In this study, the inhibitory effect of LIF was detected only in thefirst 12 h after the cells are incubated in the DM, which is STAT3-independnt. Thus, it possible that LIF might play distinct roles indifferent stages of muscle differentiation. Cytokines may requirecritical time frame to mediate activation of signal pathway. Forexample, there is a critical time window (16\u201320 h) for bFGF toactivate ERK and to repress myogenic gene expression and differ-entiation [36]. These data raise a possibility that LIF may inhibitmuscle differentiation by ERK pathway at the early stage (within12 h), but enhance differentiation through JAK2/STAT3 pathwaylater.STAT3, as a key signal transducer and activator of transcription,has been shown to interact with various nuclear proteins andtransduce important biological effects in many cell lines. SIX1,MEF2 and MyoD are key myogenic regulatory factors inducing plu-ripotent precursor cells differentiation. So we tested whether theywere involved in stat3 mediated myogenic differentiation. The re-sults showed that stat3 could interact with myoD, but not SIX1 orMEF2 in C2C12 cells in DM for 12 h, suggesting that STAT3-MyoDbinding may be responsible for the stimulatory effect of STAT3on myogenic differentiation. Further studies are needed to under-stand how STAT3 coordinates with myoD to control myogenicdifferentiation and how they cross-talk with other signaling path-ways. Taken together, our data suggest a possibility to acceleratemuscle regeneration by modulating STAT3 pathways.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a Grant from National Nature Sci-ence Foundation of China (No. 30671091) and another Grant fromNational Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 30600098).References[1] Rawls A, Olson EN.
