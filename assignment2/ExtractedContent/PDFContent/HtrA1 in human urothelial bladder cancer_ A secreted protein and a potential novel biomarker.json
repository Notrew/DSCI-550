Bladder tissue and urine specimens from cancer patients withdifferent tumor grades and stages (n 5 68) and from individuals with cystitis (n 5 16) were collected along with biopsy speci-mens and urine from healthy individuals (n 5 68). For the first time, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that HtrA1 pro-tein is produced by bladder urothelium in both physiological and inflammatory conditions, whereas it is not detectable inurothelial cancer cells regardless of tumor grade and stage. A different HtrA1 expression between normal-looking and neoplasticbladder tissue, despite similar HtrA1 mRNA levels, was also found by western blotting, which disclosed the presence of two formsof HtrA1, a native form of ~50 kDa and an autocatalytic form of ~38 kDa. Our investigations documented the presence of the twoforms of HtrA1 also in urine. The ~38 kDa form was significantly down-regulated in neoplastic tissue, whereas significantly higheramounts of both HtrA1 forms were found in urine from cancer patients compared with both healthy subjects and patients withcystitis. Our findings suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed molecule since an early stage of bladder urothelial carcinoma devel-opment and that urinary HtrA1 protein may be considered, if successfully validated, as an early and highly sensitive and specificbiomarker for this neoplasia (the sensitivity and specificity of HtrA1 are 92.65% and 95.59%, respectively).Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the West-ern world, where it is predominantly of the transitional (uro-thelial) cell type.1 Approximately 80% of patients withurothelial bladder cancer suffer from recurrence within 1 or2 years of the initial treatment.2 Fifteen to twenty percent ofbladder tumors present as muscle-invasive disease; despiteradical cystectomy (RC) and systemic therapy, 50% of thesepatients die from metastatic disease.3,4 Currently, the goldstandard for diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer iscystoscopy combined with urine cytology. Cystoscopy is inva-sive and expensive, while cytology is scarcely sensitive and ischaracterized by poor interobserver reproducibility.5 The bio-logical, morphological and clinical alterations present inmalignant and premalignant lesions give the opportunity toaccurately identify the early stage of cancer progression, sig-nificantly enhancing cancer treatment. In recent years, consid-erable advances have been made in the study of biomarkersassociated with the molecular changes occurring during thedevelopment and progression of urothelial carcinoma.6Key words: human urothelial bladder cancer, serine protease HtrA1,urinary biomarkers, UROtsa, TCC-SUP, T24 cell linesAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the onlineversion of this article.*M.L. and E.A. contributed equally to this work.Grant sponsor: Banca Marche, Universit\ufffda Politecnica delle Marche,Futura Onlus.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.28280History: Received 24 June 2012; Accepted 23 Apr 2013; Online 27May 2013Correspondence to: Teresa Lorenzi, Ph.D., Department ofExperimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty, Universit\ufffdaPolitecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020 Torrette, Ancona,Italy, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-2206-087], E-mail:teresalorenzi@yahoo.it, t.lorenzi@univpm.it or Daniela Marzioni,Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty,Universit\ufffda Politecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020Torrette, Ancona, Italy, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-2206-087], E-mail: d.marzioni@univpm.itEarlyDetectionandDiagnosisInt. J. Cancer: 133, 2650\u20132661 (2013) VC 2013 UICCInternational Journal of CancerIJCInformation generated by such biomarkers may enable inter-vention at an earlier and potentially more curable stage of thedisease than under usual clinical diagnostic conditions or mayallow the monitoring of a therapeutic action on disease pro-gression as opposed/or in addition to the classical signs andsymptoms. Through the incorporation of appropriately vali-dated biomarkers, one can expect better clinical study designs,improving patients\u2019 prospects by reducing morbidity andmortality while curbing costs which, per bladder cancerpatient from diagnosis to death, are estimated to be the high-est among all cancers. Therefore, not only the patients butalso the healthcare systems would benefit from the use of bio-markers.6 Unfortunately, most of the markers tested to dateseem to add little to current diagnostic methods.6 Therefore,the search is still on for a stand-alone biomarker providingfor specific and sensitive early screening and long-term sur-veillance of patients with or at risk of bladder cancer.HtrA1, a member of the family of HtrA proteins, is asecreted multidomain protein with serine protease activity. Itis characterized by a highly conserved, trypsin-like serineprotease domain and at least one PDZ [PSD-95 (Postsynapticdensity protein of Mr 95kDa), Dlg (Drosophila Discs-Largeprotein) and ZO-1 (Zonula occludens protein 1)] domain.7 Italso contains an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein/follistatin/Mac25-like domain and a Kazal-type serine prote-ase inhibitor motif at its N-terminus.7 Recently, it has beenshown that HtrA1 can be expressed as a native protein formof \ufffd50 kDa and as a \ufffd35 kDa product, whose generationrequires the protease activity of HtrA1.8 Serine proteaseHtrA1 is implicated in physiological processes such as TGF-b signaling9 and in the pathogenesis of various diseases,including age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s dis-ease, osteoarthritis and preeclampsia.10\u201313 Changes in itsexpression associated with specific tumor behavior have alsobeen reported. HtrA1 down-regulation has been described inhuman ovarian cancer14 and is closely related to the progres-sion and metastasis of malignant melanoma,15 whereas itsoverexpression has been seen to suppress proliferation andmigration of tumor cells in highly invasive melanoma.15Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate that HtrA1 func-tions as a tumor suppressor in various solid tumors, such asovarian and lung cancer and mesothelioma.16\u201318These findings prompted us to investigate whether HtrA1deregulation could also be relevant to the development ofurothelial bladder cancer. To the best of our knowledge, therole of HtrA1 has never been investigated in this neoplasm.HtrA1 contains a signal sequence for secretion,7 suggestingthat it may be recovered in urine. On the other hand, bladdercancer is particularly amenable to biomarker development,since secretion of tumor-associated molecules is easilydetected in urine. In this study, we evaluated for the firsttime the expression of the serine protease HtrA1 in healthyand neoplastic bladder tissue and urine by real-time PCR,immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques, sug-gesting an early association between expression/processing ofthis protein with the presence of bladder tumor. In addition,we estimated HtrA1 concentration in urine from healthyindividuals and cancer patients by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), showing that HtrA1 may be consid-ered a specific and sensitive biomarker for urothelial bladdercancer.Material and MethodsPatientsThe procedure for this research project conforms to the pro-visions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects involvedin the investigation provided their informed consent.As reported in Table 1, the study was conducted with acohort of 68 healthy individuals (controls) [age range 51\u201375years, mean age 6 standard deviation (sd): 66.5 6 5.5] and of84 patients, of which 68 affected by urothelial bladder cancer[age range 52\u201379 years, mean age 6 sd: 68.2 6 7.0] and 16affected by recurrent bacterial cystitis [age range 42\u201379 years,mean age 6 sd: 59.1 6 11.8]. Both cancer patients and con-trol group were enrolled in the study consecutively. The 84patients presented with one of the following symptoms: grosshematuria, microscopic hematuria, urinary urgency or urinarypain (Table 1). Cystoscopy was the diagnostic procedure usedto rule out the presence of urothelial carcinoma in patientswith persistent inflammation of the bladder (i.e., recurrent bac-terial cystitis unresponsive to pharmaceutical therapy). Thedistribution of the two types of surgical procedure done inthe patients with bladder cancer, i.e., transurethral resection ofthe bladder (TURB) and RC, is reported in Table 1.Specimen collectionTissue samples. Bladder tissue from the 68 cancer patientsand the 16 individuals with cystitis was provided by theWhat\u2019s new?Four-fifths of urothelial bladder cancer patients suffer a relapse of disease within one to two years of initial treatment, a prob-lem that could be alleviated by advances in biomarker-based early stage screening. This investigation introduces one possiblebiomarker, the secreted serine protease HtrA1. While previous studies have suggested that HtrA1 may function as a tumorsuppressor in certain solid tumors, this report indicates that a reduction in its expression may be an early, highly sensitiveand specific biomarker particularly for urothelial bladder cancer. The recoverability of HtrA1 in urine would allow for a nonin-vasive means of routine screening.EarlyDetectionandDiagnosisLorenzi et al. 2651Int. J.

Tumors were gradedaccording to the WHO classification19 and staged accordingto the TNM system20 (Supporting Information Table 1). Pap-illary tumor samples with different grades of malignancy(n 5 33) were obtained from patients subjected to TURB;samples of invasive urothelial carcinoma (n 5 35), showingfocal tumor, came from RC procedures (Supporting Informa-tion Table 1). The four different types of bladder specimensare described in Table 2. Tissue samples were weighed andprepared for molecular (real-time PCR), immunohistochemi-cal, and/or biochemical (western blotting) analyses as detailedin Table 2. Tissue samples from 1st-trimester placenta (Table2) were used as a positive control for real-time PCR (Q-PCR),21 immunohistochemistry and western blotting22 (Table2). Specimens for Q-PCR and western blotting analyses wereimmediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\ufffdC,those for immunohistochemistry were fixed for 24 hr in 4%neutral buffered formalin at 4\ufffdC and embedded in paraffin.Urine samples. The urine specimens of the cancer patients,collected on the day of TURB or RC, and those from the cys-titis patients were provided by the Urology Section togetherwith urine samples from the 68 healthy individuals (Table 2).They were analyzed by western blotting and ELISA, as shownin Table 2. First-void urine was collected in sterile plastictubes on ice and immediately centrifuged at 1,500g for 15min at 4\ufffdC. Creatinine was determined in the urine superna-tants before their storage at 220\ufffdC.Experimental ProceduresQ-PCRRNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time PCRwere performed as previously described.23 The sequences ofthe Q-PCR primers targeting the HtrA1 gene are reported inSupporting Information Table 2. The reference genes SDHA(Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex Subunit A) and TBP(TATA Binding Protein) were used as the housekeepinggenes for data normalization, to correct for variations inRNA quality and quantity. Results were expressed as foldchanges in relative gene expression of neoplastic vs. normal-looking tissue.To validate our results, in order to compare HtrA1mRNA expression levels between normal and infiltratingbladder urothelial carcinoma tissues, we selected datasetsTable 1.

J. Cancer: 133, 2650\u20132661 (2013) VC 2013 UICCfrom the publically available Oncomine Cancer Microarraydatabase (Compendia Biosciences; Ann Arbor, MI, USA;www.oncomine.org).24ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry was performed as previously described.13The primary antibodies used were as follows: affinity-purifiedrabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a purified bacteriallyexpressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-HtrA1 (aa 363\u2013480)human fusion protein15 (Supporting Information Table 3) andrabbit polyclonal anti-human HtrA1 antibody (raised against asintetic peptide from C-terminal region conjugated with KLH)(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (Supporting Information Table 3),after pretreatment for 10 min at 98\ufffdC in 10 mM sodium citrate,pH 6.0. An isotype control antibody (Rabbit IgG, cat. n\ufffd I-100,Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was employed as negativecontrol (Supporting Information Table 3).HtrA1 protein staining per each bladder section at lightmicroscopy was determined by two separate observers (D.M.and M.C.) in a double-blind fashion and was scored with afour-point scale attributed as follows: 1 point (absent stain-ing), 2 points (low staining), 3 points (moderate staining)and 4 points (strong staining). When the pattern of immuno-staining for HtrA1 was nonhomogeneous, the average of thescores ascribed to the different parts of the tissue was consid-ered. The urothelium, stroma, vessels and smooth musclecells were taken into consideration for the HtrA1 expressionin normal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups.Preparation of tissue lysatesLysates were obtained as previously described.23 Protein con-centrations of the extracts were assessed with the Bradfordprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy).25Samples were immunoprecipitated for analysis of theexpression of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form, whereas they weredirectly processed by western blotting for the quantitativedetermination of the autocatalytic form.Cell lines and preparation of their whole cell lysates andconditioned media for western blottingSV-40 transformed human bladder urothelial cell line (i.e.,UROtsa cell line) was a kind gift from Dr. Scott H. Garrett(Department of Urology, West Virginia University, Morgan-town, West Virginia, USA). Human bladder transitional car-cinoma cell line (i.e., TCC-SUP cell line) was kindly providedby Dr. Axel Ullrich (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry,Department of Molecular Biology, Martinsried, Germany).The human transitional carcinoma cell line T24 (ATCCVRNumber: HTB-4TM) was purchased from the American TypeCulture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The cul-tures were maintained in DMEM medium supplementedwith 10% FBS, at 37\ufffdC in 5% CO2. Eighty percent confluentcells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, collected andlysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented withprotease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysed cellswere centrifuged at 20,000g to collect supernatant which pro-tein concentration was assessed by Bradford protein assay.Conditioned media were obtained from the confluent cellcultures after centrifugation of spent media.Preparation of urine specimens for western blottingUrine supernatants were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4and Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units\u201430,000NMWL (Millipore, Milan, Italy). The samples were normal-ized on the basis of creatinine concentrations. Concentratedurine was immunoprecipitated for analysis of the expressionof the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form and directly processed by west-ern blotting for the quantitative determination of the autoca-talytic form.ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described.23For each sample, 3 lg of monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/PRSS11 antibody (raised against the recombinant humanHtrA1, aa 23\u2013480) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (Sup-porting Information Table 3) were added to the 50% slurry ofprewashed GammaBind G Sepharose beads (GE HealthcareLife Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Two micrograms ofprotein extract or 225 ll of concentrated urine wereimmunoprecipitated.Western blottingSamples (immunoprecipitated proteins, 100 lg of tissueextract, 50 ll of concentrated urine, 150 lg of the UROtsa,TCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates and 40 ll of their conditionedmedia) were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).26 Westernblotting analysis was carried out as described before,23 usingthe monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/PRSS11 antibody (R&DSystems) or the monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody, clone AC-74 (Sigma) (Supporting Information Table 3).Levels of HtrA1 and b-actin, used as the tissue house-keeping protein, were quantified by densitometry usingChemidoc and the Quantity-One program (Bio-Rad Labora-tories). The amount of HtrA1 in tissue was expressed as theratio of HtrA1 to b-actin, and its amount in urine as densito-metric intensity.HtrA1 ELISASince western blotting analysis may not be the choice methodfor diagnostics, we tested an HtrA1 ELISA kit purchasedfrom USCN, Life Science Inc. (DBA Italia s.r.l., Milan, Italy)for sensitive and specific detection of HtrA1 protein invoided urine sample. The immunogen used for preparationof the antibody provided with the kit was the recombinanthuman HtrA1 (aa 23\u2013480) and internal negative and positivequality controls were supplied in each kit. Urine samples(100 ll) were added to wells without their previous concen-trations and creatinine was used to normalize HtrA1EarlyDetectionandDiagnosisLorenzi et al. 2653Int. J.

The measurements were conducted in dupli-cate, according to the supplied protocol.Statistical analysisHtrA1 transcription and protein levels in tissue specimenswere tested using a two-tailed t test (PRISM software, version4 for Windows: GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA).Results are presented as mean 1 sd. A p value < 0.05 wasconsidered statistically significant.Differences in urinary HtrA1 among and within groupswere evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using theSAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The dataobtained from the semi-quantitative immunohistochemicalanalysis of HtrA1 expression in bladder specimens weretested by ANOVA.As in our previous study regarding HtrA1,27 theKolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed in advance to checkthe normality of variables. Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve was plotted for HtrA1 by the SAS/STAT soft-ware to assess the accuracy of diagnostic test used to discrim-inate between two conditions which, in our study, arereferred to as cases (subjects with cancer) and healthy con-trols. The analysis consists in plotting a graph of the sensitiv-ity versus 1-specificity of the diagnostic test. An area underROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.9 \ufffd AUC \ufffd 1.0 was consideredas a very good performance of the test.28 In addition, we cal-culated the proportion of patients with positive test results orwith negative test results who are correctly diagnosed (Posi-tive Predictive Value: PPV and Negative Predictive Value:NPV, respectively). To indicate the precision of the pointestimate, we used a 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsExpression of HtrA1 mRNA in bladder tissueTo determine whether HtrA1 mRNA expression may bealtered in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, neoplastic andnormal-looking bladder specimens were analyzed by Q-PCR.None of the normal, cystitis and TURB samples were exam-ined by this technique because of the lack of enough freshtissue banking (see Table 2). When SDHA was used as thehousekeeping gene, the HtrA1 transcript was not significantlydifferent in cancer compared with normal-looking tissue(p 5 0.432) (data not shown). Similarly, when TBP was usedas the housekeeping gene, mRNA expression was similar inneoplastic and normal-looking tissue (p 5 0.422) (data notshown). Gene expression data collected from OncomineMicroarray database showed no significant difference in thevalue of HtrA1 mRNA expression in infiltrating bladder uro-thelial carcinoma compared to the corresponding normal-looking counterpart, confirming our results.HtrA1 immunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical localization studies disclosed a cyto-plasmic staining pattern that was similar in normal, normal-looking (Fig. 1a) and cystitis specimens (Fig. 1b). HtrA1immunolabeling was seen in the urothelium, particularly inthe umbrella cells lining the bladder lumen (Figs. 1a and 1b).The bladder vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Figs. 1aand 1b).HtrA1 urothelial immunoreactivity declined with increas-ing neoplasm grade (Figs. 1c\u20131g). In papillary urothelial neo-plasms with low malignant potential (Fig. 1c), the urothelialcell cytoplasm was weakly HtrA1-positive in the basal layer(Fig. 1c) and largely negative in the upper layer. In addition,the vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Fig. 1c). The urotheliumof noninvasive low-grade and high-grade papillary carcino-mas (Figs. 1d and 1e) and of invasive neoplasms (Fig. 1f) wasHtrA1-negative. HtrA1 immunostaining was very weak invessel walls (data not shown). Smooth muscle cells (data notshown) and the stroma (Figs. 1a\u20131g) stained weakly or not atall for HtrA1 in all samples. The negative controls confirmedthe specificity of the immunolabeling obtained with the pri-mary antibody. The semi-quantitative immunohistochemicalanalysis revealed significant differences of HtrA1 expressionin the urothelium and vessels among normal, cystitis, TURBand RC groups (in both the urothelium and vessels p <0.0001) (Fig. 1g). On the other hand, HtrA1 expression instroma and muscle cells was not significantly different amongnormal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups (in stroma p 5 0.14and in muscle cells p 5 0.06) (Fig. 1g).Expression of HtrA1 protein in bladder, UROtsa, TCC-SUPand T24 cell lines and their conditioned mediaAs for Q-PCR, normal, cystitis and TURB samples were notanalyzed by western blotting because of the lack of enoughfresh tissue banking (see Table 2). Representative blots of RCspecimens are shown in Figure 2. Immunoblotting with anti-HtrA1 antibody disclosed two highly specific bands of \ufffd50kDa and \ufffd38 kDa (Fig. 2a), representing the predicted nativeand autocatalytic forms of HtrA1, respectively. The intensityof each band was quantified by densitometry in all tissuesamples. The \ufffd50 kDa band was not significantly different innormal-looking and neoplastic tissue (p 5 0.320) (Figs. 2aand 2b), whereas the \ufffd38 kDa band was strongly reducedand in some cases barely detectable in all cancer specimens(Fig. 2a). Based on densitometry, the autocatalytic form wasabout fourfold lower in neoplastic than in normal-lookingtissue, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.001)(Fig. 2b).Blot of lysate from UROtsa, TCC-SUP and T24 cells andof their conditioned media is shown in Figure 2c. The anti-HtrA1 antibody detected only one band of \ufffd50 kDa, corre-sponding to the HtrA1 native form, both in UROtsa celllysate and in its conditioned medium. On the contrary,HtrA1 was absent in TCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates as wellas in their conditioned media.Expression of HtrA1 protein in urine by Western blottingFigure 3a shows representative blots of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1form detected in urine from patients with bladder cancer,EarlyDetectionandDiagnosis2654 HtrA1 expression in human bladder cancerInt.

In fact, the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 bandwas detected in all cancer patients (TURB and RC), while itwas very weak and at times nearly absent in healthy individ-uals and in patients with cystitis (Fig. 3a). Densitometricanalysis showed an about eightfold increase in the levels ofthe native form in urine from cancer patients compared withhealthy subjects and patients with cystitis. These differenceswere highly significant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3b). A representa-tive western blot of the \ufffd38 kDa HtrA1 form is shown inFigure 3c. In the same urine specimens, the \ufffd38 kDa formwas found to be overexpressed, albeit not homogeneously, incancer patients compared with healthy subjects and patientswith cystitis, where it was largely absent (Fig. 3c); the differ-ences were highly significant (p 5 0.0002) (Fig. 3d).Expression of HtrA1 protein in urine by ELISA and itsdiagnostic performanceThe detection of urinary HtrA1 protein and the determina-tion of its expression levels in urine from patients with uro-thelial cancer compared with healthy individuals and patientswith cystitis were obtained by the use of the HtrA1 ELISAkit. The analysis showed higher levels of HtrA1 in urinefrom cancer patients compared with healthy subjects andpatients with cystitis. These differences were highly signifi-cant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4a).HtrA1 levels were normally distributed in patients withcancer (p 5 0.18), in healthy controls (p 5 0.13) and inpatients with cystitis (p 5 0.77). The global performance ofour diagnostic test is summarized by the area under the ROCcurve (Fig. 4b). Our results showed that AUC is equal to0.9839 (C.I. 0.97\u20130.99), highlighting a very good global per-formance of the diagnostic test. The sensitivity (SE) and spec-ificity (SP), using a cutpoint of 1.48 (HtrA1), were 92.65%(C.I. 86.44\u201398.85%) and 95.59% (C.I. 90.7\u201399.7%), respec-tively. The positive and negative predictive values were:PPV 5 95.45% (C.I. 90.42\u201399.7%) and NPV 5 92.86% (C.I.86.82\u201398.89%).DiscussionOur immunohistochemical results demonstrate for the firsttime that HtrA1 protein is produced by the bladder urothe-lium both in physiological conditions and in inflammatorypathologies such as cystitis, whereas it is not found in uro-thelial cancer tissue regardless of tumor grade and stage.These data suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed moleculesince an early stage of urothelial carcinoma development.The downexpression of HtrA1 detected in neoplastic urothe-lium was not so evident in the other bladder tissue compo-nents. The normal-looking and neoplastic bladder specimensfrom RC patients did not exhibit significant differences inHtrA1 mRNA by real-time PCR. This finding, together withimmunohistochemical data, let us to suppose that HtrA1transcription is not affected in urothelial carcinoma, but thatHtrA1 protein translation is blocked in the pathological uro-thelium. Western blotting performed in the specimens fromRC patients disclosed the coexistence of two HtrA1 proteinforms: a native form (\ufffd50 kDa) and its autocatalytic product(\ufffd38 kDa). Recent data show that the protease active formof HtrA1 is represented by its auto-proteolytic product, sug-gesting for it a crucial role in proapoptotic activity.8,16,29Since reduction of apoptosis is a recognized event contribut-ing to cancer progression,30,31 also in bladder urothelium,32the auto-proteolytic protein form may be viewed as a mole-cule with anti-cancer properties. Moreover, HtrA1 functionsas an inhibitor of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b signal-ing9 and seems to be able to bind and inhibit signaling of awide range of TGF-b family proteins9 as well as to degradeTGF-b1 in vitro.33 TGF-b1 is considered to be crucial in uri-nary bladder carcinoma tumorigenesis34 and it is also associ-ated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis,migration and metastasis in many types of malignanttumor.35 TGF-b1 is absent in the epithelial cells of normalbladder tissues while a strong expression of the protein isshown in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma.36Thus, HtrA1 and TGF-b1 expression patterns seem to beinversely correlated in normal and neoplastic bladder tissue.Since the inhibitory action of HtrA1 on TGF-b signalingwholly depends on its protease activity,9 also in this case theautocatalytic form may conceivably have greater anti-cancerproperties than the native one. The \ufffd38 kDa HtrA1 formwas highly significantly down-regulated in neoplastic com-pared with normal-looking tissue, whereas the expression ofthe native form was similar across all specimens. The differ-ence of 38 kDa HtrA1 form expression between normal-looking and bladder cancer specimens from RC patientsusing western blotting was weaker than it was expected onthe basis of immunohistochemistry. This less marked differ-ence of HtrA1 expression was due to the analysis of full-thickness bladder samples, i.e., inclusive of urothelium (nega-tive for HtrA1 in cancer) and of all other bladder tissueFigure 1.

Taking into account theseresults, it is plausible that HtrA1 protein is mainly expressedin its auto-proteolytic (active) form in normal urothelium, inorder to be more promptly available to counteract the poten-tial risk of cancer related to urinary cytotoxic compounds. Itsdecreased levels observed in neoplastic urothelial tissue, dueto a block of protein translation, could be one effector ofcancer development. This is consistent with the notion thatHtrA1 functions as a tumor suppressor, as already describedin human ovarian cancer14 and in malignant melanoma15where the molecule is downexpressed. The loss of HtrA1expression in urothelial carcinoma cells and, on the otherhand, its presence in normal urothelial cell line UROtsa iscongruent with the tumor suppressor role of HtrA1.HtrA1 autocatalytic form generation may be augmentedby upregulation of HtrA1 protein, as described in ovariancancer cells under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents(cisplatin, paclitaxel).8 The expression of HtrA1 influencesthe tumor response to chemotherapy by modulatingchemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity8 and HtrA1 is a potentialprognostic factor of clinical response to cisplatin-based chem-otherapy for patients with ovarian or gastric cancer.8,37 Con-sidering our findings concerning the association betweenHtrA1 autocatalytic form and urothelial bladder cancer, itwould be possible to hypothesize that HtrA1 could representa valuable tool to predict chemotherapy response also inpatients with this neoplasm. However, it would be necessaryto plan a new study based on the analysis of the prognosticfactors.We found that HtrA1 immunolocalization is particularlystrong in the upper portion of the urothelium, suggestingrapid release, and that the normal human urothelial cell lineUROtsa produces and constitutively secretes HtrA1 nativeform into the growth medium, showing that urotheliumcould be the potential source of HtrA1 in urine. It is notablethat normal mammalian urothelium can function not only asa permeability barrier but also as a possible supply of urinaryproteins that may play important physiological or pathologi-cal roles in the urinary tract.38 We can assume that theFigure 3.

Cancer: 133, 2650\u20132661 (2013) VC 2013 UICC50 kDa HtrA1 form in normal urothelium has two fates, i.e.,to be secreted into the urine as it is and to originate the 38kDa form by auto-proteolysis. Moreover, the lack of HtrA1production and secretion in the medium from urothelial car-cinoma cells prompt us to suppose that neoplastic urotheliumdoes not influence at all urine composition. Surprisingly, ourwestern blotting investigations documented a very strongpresence of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form in urine from patientswith different grades and stages of bladder cancer and sincean early stage of urothelial carcinoma growth. Statistical anal-ysis demonstrated that HtrA1 (50 kDa form) in this group issignificantly higher than in both healthy individuals andpatients with cystitis. Probably, normal urothelium is forcedby the flanking tumor tissue to produce more HtrA1 thanusual, possibly in the attempt to contain tumor progression,leading to an increase of secreted HtrA1 native form. Alsothe level of the \ufffd38 kDa form in urine from cancer patients,although inhomogeneous, was higher than in healthy subjectsand in individuals with inflammatory conditions, where itwas largely absent. This protein form has lost the secretionsignal sequence, thus its recovery in urine from patients withurothelial bladder cancer could be related to autoproteolysisof the native form rather than to its secretion from bladdertissue.

In particular, wedocument for the first time, using different experimentalapproaches, that expression of the \ufffd38 kDa form of HtrA1protein is strongly reduced in urothelial cancer tissue regard-less of tumor grade and stage. The most significant finding ofour study is that detection of HtrA1 in urine may representan innovative, simple, specific and sensitive approach to theearly diagnosis of bladder malignant transformation. Urinecytology and many of the currently developed urine basedbiomarkers approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), including detection of chromosomalaneuploidy and deletion using fluorescence in situ hybridiza-tion (UroVysion), have limited sensitivity for recognition oflow stage and grade tumors.39 A recent study provides thedemonstration that NMP22 and CYFRA 21-1, widely usedover the past decade, are effective markers for detecting blad-der cancer40 and there are also several emerging urinemarkers, as DNA methylation markers,41 tested extensivelyand looking quite promising, that have not yet been appliedclinically because of lack of validation. HtrA1, in our study,shows a very good diagnostic performance (ROC-AUC ofHtrA1 is 0.9839) and thus, if successfully validated testingHtrA1 assay in larger cohorts and with fewer confounders, itcould improve the predictive ability of current biomarkers,alone or in combination with them, providing a noninvasiveand practical tool for the routine screening of bladder cancerrisk in large population groups. We recognize some limita-tions of our study. We show gender disparity between cancerpatients and subjects with cystitis, meaning that the ratiobetween females and males is about 1:3 for patients with uro-thelial carcinoma and 3:1 for infection group. However, it isrecognized in literature that bladder cancer is 3 to 4 timesmore frequent in men than in women and that urinary tractinfections occur more commonly in women than men.Another limitation of the study consists in the fact that whilecarrying out a consecutive enrollment of all subjects, matchedcontrol cohort by age (6 1 year) and gender was not used.AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Dr. Alessandro Conti (Universit\ufffda Politecnicadelle Marche, Italy) and Dr. Carlo Vecchioli (Presidio Ospedali RiunitiMurri-Jesi, Italy) for providing some of the specimens.
