"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  873-880,  2013Abstract. Zyxin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that has been implicated in the regulation of actin assembly and is mainly located at focal adhesions. However, the biological roles of Zyxin in cancer cells are incompletely understood. We analyzed the functions of Zyxin in cell migration and the inva-sive potential of OSCC. Zyxin expression was examined using eight OSCC cell lines with two different cell morphologies (6\u00a0epithelial\u00a0type\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type).\u00a0To\u00a0knockdown\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0expression, OSCC cells were transfected with Zyxin siRNA and control siRNA. The cell lines were studied by western blot analysis, immunocytochemical analysis and cell migration and invasion assay. Epithelial type OSCC cells showed a high level of E-cadherin expression and a low level of Zyxin expres-sion. N-cadherin as well as Zyxin were strongly expressed in fibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells.\u00a0Expression\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0LPP\u00a0and\u00a0TRIP6,\u00a0members\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0human\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0family,\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0differ\u00a0between\u00a0epithelial\u00a0type\u00a0and\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type.\u00a0Knockdown\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0expression\u00a0by\u00a0siRNA\u00a0in\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells\u00a0was associated with cell morphological changes from spindle (fibroblastic)\u00a0to\u00a0polygonal\u00a0(epithelial)\u00a0shape\u00a0and\u00a0significantly\u00a0inhibited cell growth as well as cell migration and inva-sion.\u00a0Expression\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0Rac1\u00a0and\u00a0Cdc42\u00a0were\u00a0weaker\u00a0in\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0siRNA-treated\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0 type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells\u00a0 than\u00a0 in\u00a0control siRNA-treated cells, but the expression of RhoA did not\u00a0differ\u00a0significantly.\u00a0Treatment\u00a0of\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells with Rac1 inhibitor decreased the expression of Zyxin mRNA and protein.

We found loss of E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin expression on\u00a0transition\u00a0from\u00a0epithelial\u00a0type\u00a0to\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type.\u00a0Reduced\u00a0E-cadherin expression in OSCC cells is associated with more aggressive\u00a0 tumor\u00a0 behavior\u00a0 and\u00a0 worse\u00a0 outcomes\u00a0 (30,31).\u00a0Moreover, cadherin switching (i.e., the loss of E-cadherin expression\u00a0and\u00a0gain\u00a0of\u00a0N-cadherin\u00a0expression)\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0crucial\u00a0event of EMT in human cancers, which correlates with histologic differentiation, invasion pattern and lymph node metastasis.\u00a0Head\u00a0and\u00a0neck\u00a0cancer\u00a0cells\u00a0also\u00a0show\u00a0cadherin\u00a0switching associated with EMT features and EMT cancer cells\u00a0show\u00a0increased\u00a0invasiveness\u00a0(32).\u00a0However,\u00a0molecular\u00a0relations among cell morphology, cell motility and EMT in OSCC cells are incompletely understood.Zyxin, a focal adhesion-associated LIM protein family, harbors\u00a0 distinct\u00a0 actin\u00a0 polymerization\u00a0 activity\u00a0 (33)\u00a0 and\u00a0 is\u00a0located primarily at focal adhesions and regulates actin cyto-skeleton\u00a0dynamics,\u00a0cell\u00a0movement,\u00a0and\u00a0signal\u00a0transduction\u00a0(34,35).\u00a0When\u00a0we\u00a0reduced\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0expression\u00a0levels\u00a0in\u00a0fibro-blastic type OSCC cells by treatment with Zyxin siRNA, cell growth\u00a0was\u00a0inhibited\u00a0significantly\u00a0as\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0control\u00a0siRNA-treated cells. To clarify why Zyxin siRNA treatment inhibited\u00a0 the\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0 type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells,\u00a0cell\u00a0cycles and apoptosis induction were examined. However, cell cycles were unaffected, and the apoptosis index was not increased by Zyxin siRNA treatment. We therefore speculated that the involvement of cell growth factor was decreased by nutrient\u00a0availability,\u00a0hypoxia,\u00a0heat\u00a0shock,\u00a0DNA\u00a0damage\u00a0and\u00a0osmotic\u00a0stress\u00a0(36).Cells with inhibited Zyxin expression display reduced adhesive properties, reduced migration, reduced capacity to\u00a0build\u00a0robust\u00a0actin\u00a0stress\u00a0fibers\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0chemical\u00a0stimulus, and disturbed focal adhesion accumulation of actin regulators in the Zyxin family. Shinto et al\u00a0(37)\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0stable expression of the oncoprotein associated with scirrhous gastric cancer cells resulted in decreased Zyxin levels and a corresponding increase in motility. Furthermore, Amsellem et al\u00a0(38)\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0knockout\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0in\u00a0Ewing's\u00a0sarcoma\u00a0cells is associated with enhanced cell motility. However, knockdown\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0by\u00a0siRNA\u00a0in\u00a0SKOV-3\u00a0cells,\u00a0a\u00a0human\u00a0ovarian cancer cell line, had no influence on cell migra-tion\u00a0(39).\u00a0To\u00a0date,\u00a0these\u00a0disparate\u00a0effects\u00a0have\u00a0not\u00a0been\u00a0fully\u00a0elucidated,\u00a0but\u00a0may\u00a0result\u00a0from\u00a0specific\u00a0cellular\u00a0features.When Rho family protein expression was examined in Zyxin\u00a0knockdown\u00a0cells,\u00a0 reduced\u00a0 expression\u00a0of\u00a0Rac1\u00a0 and\u00a0CDC42 was found. This finding was consistent with the results\u00a0of\u00a0Pratt\u00a0et al\u00a0(40),\u00a0who\u00a0suggested\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0Ajuba/Zyxin\u00a0family of LIM proteins leads to activation of Rac during cell migration. These results suggest that Zyxin is a potential EMT\u00a0marker\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0overexpression\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0promotes\u00a0cell growth and invasion via up-regulation of Rac1, CDC42 or both in OSCC cells. Although we have not yet found an inhibitor of CDC42, EHT1864 decreased Zyxin mRNA and protein in HOC-313. Our results suggest a mechanism by which reduced Zyxin expression might contribute to tumor regression by affecting cytoarchitecture and motility.AcknowledgementsThis\u00a0 study\u00a0 was\u00a0 supported\u00a0 by\u00a0 JSPS\u00a0 KAKENHI\u00a0 Grant\u00a0no.\u00a022592249\u00a0(to\u00a0K.N.)\u00a0and\u00a0Grant-in-Aid\u00a0for\u00a0Young\u00a0Scientists\u00a0(B)\u00a023792399\u00a0(to\u00a0E.S.).References\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0 Pereira\u00a0MC,\u00a0 Oliveira\u00a0 DT,\u00a0 Landman\u00a0 G\u00a0 and\u00a0 Kowalski\u00a0 LP:\u00a0Histologic subtypes of oral squamous cell carcinoma: prog-nostic relevance.
