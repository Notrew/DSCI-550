We identified an extracellular subtilase from Arabidopsis, SBT3.3, the overexpression of which enhancesinnate immune responses while the loss of function compromises them. SBT3.3 expression initiates a durable autoinductionmechanism that promotes chromatin remodeling and activates a salicylic acid(SA)-dependent mechanism of priming ofdefense genes for amplified response. Moreover, SBT3.3 expression-sensitized plants for enhanced expression of the OXI1kinase gene and activation of MAP kinases following pathogen attack, providing additional clues for the regulation ofimmune priming by SBT3.3. Conversely, in sbt3.3 mutant plants pathogen-mediated induction of SA-related defense geneexpression is drastically reduced and activation of MAP kinases inhibited. Moreover, chromatin remodeling of defense-related genes normally associated with activation of an immune priming response appear inhibited in sbt3.3 plants, furtherindicating the importance of the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase in the establishment of immune priming. Our results alsopoint to an epigenetic control in the regulation of plant immunity, since SBT3.3 is up-regulated and priming activated whenepigenetic control is impeded. SBT3.3 represents a new regulator of primed immunity.Citation: Ram\u0131\u0301rez V, Lo\u0301pez A, Mauch-Mani B, Gil MJ, Vera P (2013) An Extracellular Subtilase Switch for Immune Priming in Arabidopsis.

They counteract microbial infections via activa-tion of an innate immune system in a timely, accurate, andeffective manner following pathogen recognition. The innateimmune response is thought to act na\u0131\u0308vely to individual pathogenencounters and is dependent on the recognition of broadlyconserved molecular features, known as microbe-associatedmolecular patterns (MAMPs), by plasma membrane proteinsknown as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR perception ofMAMPs at the cell surface leads to a pattern-triggered immuneresponse called PTI [1]. PTI is characterized by the rapidgeneration of ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species(ROS), phosphorylation cascades, and a transcriptional repro-graming that favors defense responses over routine cellularrequirements [2]. The defense programme is ultimately controlledthrough the build-up of specific signalling hormone blends, ofwhich salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are particularlyimportant, and eventually establish a broad systemic alert statethroughout the plant.Plants develop heightened activation of the innate immuneresponse state resulting from the initial infection manifested in theform of enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broadspectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) orcross-protection exhibits memory characteristics after the firstencounter with a pathogen - training effect - and appearsevolutionarily conserved, even outside the plant kingdom. Neteaet al. [3] coined the term \u2018\u2018trained immunity\u2019\u2019 to differentiate itfrom \u2018\u2018innate immunity\u2019\u2019 (as it is induced only secondarily in hoststhat have previously encountered a primary infection), or from\u2018\u2018adaptive immunity\u2019\u2019 (as this implies specificity through T and Bcells). In plants, two distinct types of this resistance form have beendescribed: systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and inducedsystemic resistance (ISR) [4,5]; both represent a functionalimmune acclimation requiring the defense response regulatorNPR1.Particularly relevant in IR responses is the observation thatdefence genes, in both the local (infected) and distal tissue, respondto much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid androbust manner than controls, thus revealing a \u2018\u2018priming\u2019\u2019phenomenon. In fact, priming has long been known as acomponent of IR responses in plants [6,7] and mammals [8\u201310],and more recently in invertebrates, which like plants lack adaptiveimmunity [11]. Similarly, Arabidopsis mutants attenuated inpathogen defense (i.e. npr1) are also compromised in priming[12,13]. Organic and inorganic compounds can also induce thisform of resistance in plants [14]. Among these, azelaic acid [15],SA, and its functional analogue benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-car-bothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) [16], or the non-protein aminoPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445acid b-aminobutyric acid (BABA) [17] have attracted markedinterest as they potentiate pathogen-specific defense mechanisms,and induction of a primed state. However, very little is knownabout the molecular mechanism(s) and signals that set a primingstate in motion, or the identity of molecular components thatpertain to the maintenance of a long lasting immune primed state,such as SAR.Conrath et al. [18] hypothesized that IR or cell priming could bebuilt on the accumulation of dormant or inactive signallingproteins, integral in signal amplification that becomes operativefollowing a challenge with another pathogen, thereby initiatingsignal amplification leading to a faster and stronger activation ofdefense responses. However, the identity of such signallingcomponents remains elusive. Interestingly, Beckers et al. [12] haveshown that during development of BTH induced resistance inArabidopsis, priming is associated with accumulation of inactiveproteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 andMPK6. Exposure to the challenges of biotic and abiotic stressorsresults in stronger activation of the two kinases in primed plantsrelative to non-primed plants, which is linked to enhanced defensegene expression. Priming of defense gene expression was reducedin mpk3 or mpk6 mutants, showing that pre-stress deposition of aMPK cascade is a critical step in priming plants for a full defenseresponse induction during IR [12].Essential IR response components must rely in a plant\u2019scapacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanismsinvolved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, theimportance of chromatin remodeling and covalent histonemodifications is emerging [19]. Jaskiewicz et al. [20], reportedthat during primed BTH immunity, increased acetylation ofhistone H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylation of histone H3 atLys-4 (H3K4me3) was detected at promoter regions of several SA-responsive genes encoding transcription factors (i.e. WRKY6,WRKY29, and WRKY52). Similarly, constitutively increasedH3K4me3 and H3K9ac mark setting in chromatin of the SA-dependent PR1 gene was initially reported in sni1 (suppressor of nrp1-1, inducible 1) mutant [21]. The settling of these histonemodifications lead chromatin into a suitable state for efficientSA-responsive gene induction when needed. The results alsoindicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remod-eling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in theplant stress responses [19]. On the other hand RNA Polymerase Vis an enzyme critical in the epigenetic RNA-directed DNAmethylation (RdDM) pathway and is involved in regulating bothDNA methylation and histone modifications [22]. In this context,Lo\u0301pez et al. [23] reported that RNA Polymerase V defectivemutants carry a constitutive priming phenotype where SA-relateddefense genes are poised for enhanced activation via similarH3K4me3 and H3K9ac histone modifications in their promoters.These results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control asan additional layer of complexity in plant immunity and IRregulation [23]. Furthermore, DNA methylation has beenimplicated in the transmission of a priming state or stress memory,endowing progeny of pathogen-inoculated plants with heightenedresistance (transgenerational IR), suggesting plants can inheritpriming sensitization [24,25].In the present study, we report on identification and charac-terization of the inducible Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 tocharacterize additional cellular components mediating initiationand or/maintenance of primed immunity. This extracellularproteolytic enzyme serves a signaling role in establishing immunepriming. The mechanism subsequently activates chromatinremodeling and defense genes become poised for enhancedactivation following pathogen attack. Our study provides strongevidence that SBT3.3 is a primary switch in immune priming, andit may represent one of the missing components in systemic IRestablishment.ResultsThe Arabidopsis subtilase gene SBT3.3 is up-regulated inthe csb3 mutantThe Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance csb3 (constitutivesubtilisin3) mutant [26] was isolated during a search for negativedisease resistance regulators in a mutant screening that evaluatedconstitutive expression of GUS activity driven by the 59 promoterregion of a pathogen-induced subtilase gene (P69C) from tomatoplants [27]. Arabidopsis possess fifty-six highly similar genesencoding subtilases [28], therefore constitutive expression of theArabidopsis gene homologous to P69C would be similarly up-regulated in the csb3 mutant. Constitutively expressed genesdifferentially expressed in the csb3 mutant with respect to wild-typeplants were identified by microarray analysis of RNA transcriptsusing ATH1 Affymetrix chips. The microarray analysis (NCBIGEO Series number GSE35507) identified one hundred down-regulated genes and 367 up-regulated genes in the csb3 mutant(Supplemental Table S1 and Figure S1). Among the genes up-regulated $2-fold (p values,0.05) in the csb3 mutant, weidentified 23 genes that could be linked to disease resistance andSA-mediated responses based on published results (SupplementalTable S2). It was notable that among them one encoded asubtilase: SBT3.3 (At1g32960). Moreover, public microarray datamining showed that SBT3.3, out of the 56 paralogous subtilasesfrom Arabidopsis, with the exception of At1g32940, is the oneshowing strongest response to pathogen attack and to pathogen-related stress signals (Supplementary Figure S2).Coincident with what has been described in the tomatogenome, where the P69C subtilase clusters with three additionalP69C-like ORFs (i.e. P69A, P69D, P69C, and P69B) [29], theSBT3.3 subtilase gene was similarly embedded in a genomiccluster encompassing three additional subtilases (i.e. SBT3.5,Author SummaryFollowing a first encounter with a pathogen, highereukaryotes develop enhanced resistance to subsequentinfections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type ofinduced resistance (IR) exhibits memory characteristicsafter the first encounter with a pathogen \u2014trainingeffect\u2014 and appears evolutionarily conserved. IR responsecomponents must reside in a plant\u2019s capacity to reprogramgene expression. Among the mechanisms involved inimmune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the im-portance of chromatin remodelling is emerging. Recentstudies indicated a causal link between priming andchromatin remodelling, pointing to a histone memory forinformation storage in the plant immune response. Theseresults emphasized the importance of epigenetic controlas an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity.However, the nature of the components for activating thistype of immunological memory remains elusive. Here, in asearch aiming to identify cellular factors integral inregulating immunity in Arabidopsis, we found that theSBT3.3 gene, encoding an extracellular subtilase enzyme, ispivotal for establishing plant immune priming. Moreover,based on molecular and genetic evidences, our resultsindicate that SBT3.3 expression is under epigenetic controlthus highlighting the importance of this mechanism ofgene regulation in the control of plant immunity and IR.SBT3.3 and Immune PrimingPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445SBT3.4, SBT3.3 and SBT3.2) in Chromosome 1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, itseems very likely that the Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase, couldrepresent the evolutionarily conserved ortholog of the P69Csubtilase from tomato, and the promoter activation was the cluefor identifying the csb3 mutant.The SBT3.3 gene encodes a 777 amino acid preproenzyme(Fig. 1B and Supplemental Figure S3) containing a N-terminal 25amino acid signal peptide followed by an 86-amino acidpropolypeptide (aa 26 to 111), and a 666-amino acid maturepolypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 71237 Da. Themature polypeptide comprises eight potential asparagine-linkedglycosylation sites (NXS/T). On the basis of sequence similaritieswith other subtilases, including P69C [30], the amino acid residuesSer-555, Asp-145, and His-223 were identified as residues of thecatalytic triad (Fig. 1B).Expression pattern of SBT3.3 following pathogeninoculationTo mode of SBT3.3 gene regulation in plant immunity wasassessed by inoculating Col-0 leaves with the bacterial pathogenPseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PsDC3000), carrying or not theavirulence gene AvrRpm1, and temporal gene expression patternswere determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). SBT3.3was barely detectable in mock-inoculated plants, but stronglyinduced during the PsDC3000 immune response (Fig. 1C).However, inconsistent with observations for SA-regulatedmarker genes (i.e. PR-1 and PR-2), SBT3.3 induction wastransient, peaking at 48 hpi (hours post inoculation) andabruptly decaying thereafter. The strongest induction wasobserved following inoculation with the avirulent strainPsDC3000 (AvrRpm1) (Figure 1C); induction was again transient,peaking at 12 h.p.i, and decayed thereafter. SBT3.3 expressionpreceded PR-1 and PR-2 gene induction, suggesting that thesignals that set in motion transcriptional reprogramming ofthese two types of gene responses might differ. Expression of PR-1 and PR-2 genes in the distal non-inoculated leaves was alsoobserved for SBT3.3, although distal expression was not as highas that attained in local leaves (Fig. 1C). High and rapid (withinan hour) induced SBT3.3 expression was also promoted bybacterial PAMP flg22 application to Col-0 plants (SupplementalFig. S4), providing additional support for the associationof SBT3.3 expression with early innate immune responseactivation.SBT3.3 functions in disease resistanceThe importance of SBT3.3 in plant immunity was investi-gated by characterizing the response of two independent T-DNA insertion lines for SBT3.3 (sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2; Fig. 1A)to PsDC3000 infection (Fig. 2A). We also characterized theresponse of two independent T-DNA lines available for one ofthe linked subtilase genes (i.e. SBT3.4) within the same genomiccluster (sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2; Fig. 1A). The enhanced diseasesusceptibility mutant npr1-1 was incorporated into the experi-ments as a control. Disease performance was assayed bymeasuring bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A).The two control mutant lines, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 behaved asinoculated Col-0 plants, indicating that SBT3.4 is not essentialto activate immune responses. However, npr1 plants, and eitherone of the two sbt3.3 mutants, supported significant increases inbacterial growth. The enhanced disease susceptibility wasaccompanied by development of disease symptoms in the formof visible chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A). Theresults suggest that SBT3.3 positively regulates disease resistanceto PsDC3000.Changes in the susceptibility of sbt3.3 plants to biotrophicpathogens were further investigated by inoculating plants with avirulent strain of the obligate oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidop-sidis (isolate Noco) (Fig. 2B). Disease severity was assessed at7 d.p.i in lactophenol trypan-blue-stained leaves. The leaves wereFigure 1. SBT3.3 genome organization and induced expressionfollowing P. syringae DC3000 infection.

Both, sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2 mutant plants exhibited a significantly higher degree ofcolonization by the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants(Fig. 2B), becoming heavily covered with sporangiophores, whichelicited appearance of chlorosis and eventual leaf collapse(namely Class V). The observed enhanced disease susceptibilityof sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2 plants to H. arabidopsidis was corroboratedby directly counting of spore production in inoculated plants(Supplemental Fig. S5). These results confirmed that loss ofSBT3.3 function also enhanced plant susceptibility to H.arabidopsisdis, further substantiating its value in establishing aneffective plant immune response.SBT3.3 is required for expression of SA-responsive genesCompromised expression of SA-responsive genes is observed inmutants defective in resistance to biotrophic pathogens (i.e. npr1;[31]). Consequently, we considered the possibility that theincreased susceptibility towards pathogens observed in SBT3.3defective mutants might be similarly accompanied by a compro-mised expression of SA-responsive genes. Therefore, induction ofPR-1 accumulation was examined by Western blot in sbt3.3, npr1,and Col-0 plants following inoculation with PsDC3000. The PR-1protein, as expected, was nearly absent in npr1 plants, even at48 hpi with PsDC3000 (Fig. 2C), while PR-1 accumulation wasnotable in Col-0 following inoculation. Interestingly, sbt3.3-1 andsbt3.3-2 plants exhibited results similar to the npr1 mutant, showingFigure 2.

These results were confirmed atthe transcriptional level by measuring PR-1 transcript level by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2D). As for NPR1 being required for full immunity,our results suggest that SBT3.3 is required for full expression ofdownstream SA-responsive genes. This helps explaining whymutants defective in SBT3.3 are compromised in diseaseresistance (Figure 2A and B).SBT3.3 expression is SA-independent and responds toH2O2The same mRNA preparations shown in Figure 2D were usedto quantify SBT3.3 transcript accumulation following inoculationwith PsDC3000 in Col-0 and npr1 plants (Fig. 2E). RNApreparations from sbt3.3 plants (here used as a control) served todemonstrate that in the mutant induced SBT3.3 expression wasdrastically down-regulated due to the T-DNA insertion. In markedcontrast with the substantial reduction observed for PR-1activation (Figure 2D), SBT3.3 expression in npr1 plants wasidentical to that attained in Col-0 plants. Furthermore, in sid2-1mutant plants (defective in SA synthesis) induction of SBT3.3expression upon inoculation with PsDC3000(AvrRpm1), remainedunchanged with respect to Col-0 plants (Fig. 3A). This differs withthe compromised expression of PR-1 occurring in sid2 plants(Fig. 3A). These contrasting differences indicated that forpathogen-induced SBT3.3 expression, SA synthesis and itsperception through NPR1 are dispensable.Since oxidative burst and concurrent H2O2 accumulationpreceded SA build-up during basal immunity activation [32]and SBT3.3 induction appeared as an early event preceding PRgene induction by SA (Fig. 1C\u2013D), we hypothesized that H2O2could mediate SBT3.3 induction. In fact, spraying Arabidopsisleaves with a 1 mM solution of H2O2 elicited a rapid SBT3.3induction which was notable at 1 to 3 hours after treatment(Fig. 3B). Similarly, expression of the OXI1 gene, which encodes akinase highly induced under oxidative stress conditions [33] wastriggered by H2O2 (Fig. 3B). However, under similar inductiveconditions expression of the SA-regulated gene PR-1 remainedunchanged (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the cat2 mutant defective in thedismutation of H2O2 and exhibiting enhanced H2O2 accumula-tion, revealed increased SBT3.3 expression compared to Col-0(Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that SBT3.3 activationmight result from early H2O2 production during the immuneresponse.SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulates extracellularlyPlant subtilases are synthesized in the form of preproproteinprecursors, translocated via a signal peptide into the endomem-brane system, and activated through further cleavage of thepropeptide [34]. Most plant subtilases are considered glycopro-teins that predominantly accumulate extracellularly [30,34,35].SBT3.3 subcellular localization was determined by fusing mono-meric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry) to the C-terminus ofthe full length SBT3.3, and the construct, driven by 35S promoter,expressed in Nicotiana benthaminana leaves using agro-infiltration.Localization of the fusion protein was confirmed by confocalmicroscopy. Results showed that SBT3.3-mCherry fluorescencewas uniformly distributed in the pericellular apoplastic space(Fig. 4A). Similar pericellular localization was observed intransgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a 35S::SBT3.3-GFP geneconstruct (Supplemental Fig. S6). The mCherry-tagged subtilasewas co-expressed with either a construct bearing the plasmamembrane integral protein PIP1 fused to YFP, or alternativelywith a free cytosolic YFP protein to more precisely define itslocalization. SBT3.3-mCherry was localized externally to thecytoplasm, as revealed when co-expressed with a free cytosolicYFP (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SBT3.3-mCherry was found to besandwiched between the PIP1-YFP-tagged plasma membranemarker of adjacent cells (Fig. 4B) and thus unambiguouslylocalized to the extracellular matrix. SBT3.3 extracellular local-ization was also confirmed upon expression of a SBT3.3-GFPprotein fusion in the presence of FM4-64, a plasma membranespecific fluorescent dye (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, expression of anSBT3.3noSP-GFP gene construct in which the N-terminal 25amino acid signal peptide of SBT3.3 has been deleted, revealedthat the SBT3.3noSP-GFP protein fusion was not secreted to theextracellular matrix and was retained in the cytoplasm, asdelineated by the co-localization with FM4-64 (Fig. 4D). Theseresults indicate that SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulated in theplant extracellular matrix, and secretion depends on the presenceof its signal peptide.Figure 3. SBT3.3 gene expression is SA-independent andrapidly induced by H2O2.

[36] demonstrated that following agro-infiltration with a GFP-tagged phytaspase, an Arabidopsis celldeath-associated subtilase of similar size to SBT3.3; two proteins of,110 and ,120 kD corresponding to the mature and the pro-protein phytaspases, respectively, accumulated in crude extracts[34]. Following expression of SBT3.3-GFP, two similar proteinbands of ,110 and ,120 kD were detected in Western blots usingan anti-GFP antibody (upper panel; Fig. 4E). The differencebetween the theoretical mature 98,2 kD SBT3.3-GFP fusion andthe observed mature 110 kD proteins must be due to posttrans-lational modifications. In fact, glycosylation was early proposed toregulate activity of plant subtilases [37,38]. We performedWestern blots of the same leaf extracts and developed thenitrocellulose filters with Concanavalin A (Con A) coupled tohorseradish peroxidase to identify if SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Theseanalyses revealed that Con A recognized the 120/110 kD doublet(Fig. 4E) in extracts expressing the SBT3.3-GFP construct, thusconfirming that SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Interestingly, Con A alsorecognized a band of ,70 kD that only accumulated followingSBT3.3-GFP expression (Figure 4E). This ,70 kD band wasreminiscent of a glycosylated 69 kD P69 subtilase conserved in theSolanaceous species [27,30]. To verify this possibility, Westernblots were developed with anti-P69C antibodies [30]. Resultsrevealed that the ,70 kD Con-A reacting band was recognized byanti-P69 antibodies (Fig. 4E) indicating that SBT3.3-GFP signaledtobacco cells to activate expression of an endogenous P69 subtilasehomologue. Interestingly, when we extended this analysis to otherdefense-related proteins, i.e. by using antibodies against the PR-1aisoform from tobacco, we observed that overexpression of SBT3.3-GFP similarly triggered SA-responsive PR-1a protein accumula-tion (lower panel; Fig. 4E). We subsequently created a missensemutant in the SBT3.3-GFP \u2018\u2018catalytic triad\u2019\u2019 (S555A; SBT3.3m-Figure 4.

Expression of the missensemutant in N. benthamiana no longer promoted local accumulationof the corresponding endogenous P69 subtilase, or the PR-1aprotein (Supplemental Figure S7). All of these observations areconsistent with a model in which Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilaselocal expression autonomously triggers immune-like responses in aheterologous system, and the serine proteolytic activity of thesubtilase is necessary for this effect. As occurs in SBT3.3OEX1plants (see below), expression of the SBT3.3-GFP gene construct intransgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred enhanced disease resis-tance to PsDC3000 and is in contrast with the lack of effectobserved for the SBT3.3m-GFP construct (Supplemental FigureS8). Moreover, the same SBT3.3-GFP gene construct is able toabrogate the characteristic enhanced disease susceptibility pheno-type of sbt3.3 plants, conferring enhanced disease resistance toPsDC3000 to the stably transformed sbt3.3 mutant plants(Supplemental Figure S9). This further indicates functionality ofSBT3.3-GFP fusion protein in promoting immune responses inArabidopsis.SBT3.3 artificial expression in transgenic Arabidopsistriggers expression of the endogenous geneThe above observations indicated that SBT3.3 promotes theexpression and accumulation of a homologous subtilase (i.e. P69)in N. benthamiana. We studied a stable transgenic Arabidopsisline constitutively expressing SBT3.3 under the control of the 35Spromoter (SBT3.3OEX) by measuring activation on the corre-sponding endogenous SBT3.3 gene to test if the same phenom-enon could be reproduced in Arabidopsis. Antibodies againstSBT3.3 were not available; therefore we instead performed RT-qPCR measurements using 2 different pairs of oligonucleotides.One of those pairs discriminates between the endogenous SBT3.3mRNAs (endoSBT3.3), transcribed from its own gene, and the otherpair was designed to measure the whole amount of SBT3.3mRNAs (SBT3.3). In Col-0 plants, as expected, both SBT3.3 andendoSBT3.3 transcript expression was very low (Fig. 4F). Incontrast, in the transgenic SBT3.3OEX line, SBT3.3 transcriptaccumulation was prominent (Fig. 4F), and importantly, this wasalso followed by a high endoSBT3.3 transcript accumulation. Thiseffect gives support to the hypothesis that SBT3.3 expression isable per se to signal its own gene activation. This induction appears\u2018\u2018self\u2019\u2019 controlled, since endogenous PR-1 transcript levels intransgenic plants do not exhibit significant variation with respectto Col-0 plants (Fig. 4F). However, in agro-infiltrated tobaccoleaves we observed that SBT3.3-GFP expression promotesaccumulation of both the endogenous P69 subtilase homolog,and the SA-dependent PR-1a protein. This difference can only beexplained by noting that in the experiments with N. benthamiana, A.tumefaciens is inevitably present, which in turn may supply PAMPsin collaboration with SBT3.3, triggering a downstream SAsignaling pathway, and in turn SA-defense related gene activation.If this mechanism operated effectively, then SBT3.3 would berequired to facilitate early immune signaling preceding defenseresponse activation.SBT3.3 overexpression confers enhanced diseaseresistance to PsDC3000 and H. arabidopsidisTwo independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines that overex-press SBT3.3 were inoculated with PsDC3000 and diseaseresponse recorded to further assess the role of SBT3.3 subtilasein plant immunity (i.e. SBT3.3OEX1 and SBT3.3OEX2). Theenhanced disease resistance line overexpressing the NPR1regulator (NPR1-H, [39]), one of the SBT3.3 defective mutants(i.e. sbt3.3-1), and Col-0 were included in this experiment forcomparison. Figure 5A shows that the two SBT3.3OEX linesexhibited significant enhanced disease resistance responses toPsDC3000 compared to Col-0. This enhanced resistance was ofa magnitude similar to that attained by NPR1-H plants. Incontrast, the sbt3.3-1 mutant reproduced the expected increaseddisease susceptibility previously shown in Figure 2.The SBT3.3 overexpressing lines exhibited an enhanced diseaseresistance phenotype when exposed to H. arabidopsidis (Fig. 5B).The two lines overexpressing SBT3.3 exhibited a significantlylower colonization of the oomycete than the control Col-0 plantsor the highly susceptible sbt3.3-1 mutant (Fig. 5B). The observedenhanced disease resistance of sbt3.3-1 to H. arabidopsidis wascorroborated by directly counting of spore production ininoculated plants (Supplemental Fig. S5). The observed height-ened resistance against these two pathogens indicated that SBT3.3functions as a positive plant immunity regulator. Furthermore,when the SBT3.3 overexpression phenotype was assayed in an nrp1or sid2 mutant background, the enhanced disease resistance toPsDC3000 was abrogated (Fig. 5C). These results indicate thatSBT3.3, as a positive plant immunity regulator, operates upstreamof the SA pathway.SBT3.3 expression confers enhanced activation of MPKkinasesElevated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activationis genuinely linked to IR development [12], and in general toinnate immune responses [40,41,42]. Therefore, our next objec-tive was to demonstrate if the enhanced resistance phenotypemediated by the sole SBT3.3 subtilase expression could elicitelevated MPKs activation. We subsequently employed anantibody recognizing the phosphorylated residues within theMAPK activation loop (the so called pTEpY motif, where pdenotes the phosphorylated residue). Western blot analysis ofprotein extracts derived from healthy Col-0 plants or from twoSBT3.3OEX lines revealed positive immunoreactive signals in twopolypeptides corresponding to MPK6 and MPK3 [42]. Followingdensitometric scanning of Western blots, the two immunoreactivebands appeared moderately more intense in the overexpressionlines relative to Col-0 control lines (Fig. 5D\u2013E). Inoculation withPsDC3000 promoted a further activation-associated dual TEYphosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6, which was higher in thetwo SBT3.3OEX lines than in Col-0 plants (Fig. 5D\u2013E). Inaddition, MPK4/MPK11, which migrated as a single band onSDS-PAGE [42], became activated only following bacterialinoculation, and activation was again more intense in the twoSBT3.3OEX lines. Therefore, dual phosphorylation of the TEYamino acid motif within the MPK activation loop, which isrequired for kinase activity appeared increased in plants expressingSBT3.3. However, despite these differences at the protein level, nosignificant differences were detected with respect to transcriptaccumulation induction for these MPKs between Col-0 andSBT3.3OEX lines (Fig. 5F).OXI1 is a serine/threonine kinase of the AGC protein kinasefamily required for oxidative burst-mediated signaling in Arabi-dopsis; its expression was consistent with that of SBT3.3, and wasinduced by H2O2 ([33]; and Fig. 3B). OXI1 was required forMPK3 and MPK6 activation and for basal resistance to H.arabidopsidis [33]. In view of these observations, we hypothesizedthat the imposed SBT3.3 expression might sensitize cells to bringearlier or higher OXI1 expression levels following pathogeninfection, and in turn provide an explanation for the higheractivation observed in MPKs. We measured OXI1 comparativeSBT3.3 and Immune PrimingPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 8 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445transcript level between Col-0 and two SBT3.3OEX lines followingPsDC3000 infection by RT-qPCR. Results indicated the twoSBT3.3OEX lines expressed OXI1 to higher levels than Col-0(Fig. 5G). This offers a viable explanation as to why MPKsexhibited increased activation in SBT3.3OEX plants followingpathogen attack, even in the absence of differential geneexpression relative to Col-0. Moreover, in sbt3.3 mutant linesMPKs activation following inoculation with PsDC3000 wasdrastically reduced in comparison to Col-0 (Figure 5H). Thisobservation reinforces the consideration that SBT3.3 appears tofunction as a positive regulator of the pathway leading toactivation of MAP kinases. Interestingly, MPKs activation wasnot altered in the enhanced disease susceptibility nrp1 mutant(Figure 5H) and neither was the expression of the SBT3.3 genealtered in this same mutant (Figure 3F). This served as a controltowards the specific requirement of SBT3.3 for MAKs activationand suggest that this specific signal module operates upstream ofthe NPR1 regulator.SA-mediated defense genes are poised for enhancedactivation in plants overexpressing SBT3.3The above results prompted us to search if SA-dependent geneswere poised for increase activation following SBT3.3 expression.Therefore, we inoculated Col-0 plants, and one SBT3.3OEX linewith PsDC3000, and compared PR-1 expression patterns.Interestingly, after pathogen inoculation induction of PR-1 geneexpression showed a notorious enhancement in SBT3.3OEX plantswhen compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the genes encodingthe transcription factors WRKY6, WRKY53, and WRKY35,mediating transcriptional regulation of SA-related genes, includingPR-1 [43], themselves induced by pathogen infection [44], showedsimilar enhanced induced expression in SBT3.3OEX plants(Fig. 6A). Thus, SBT3.3 mediated poising of defense genes forenhanced activation following perception of a pathogenic cue,invoking a role for SBT3.3 in priming immune responses.Poising SA\u2013related genes and primed immunity concur inplants defective in the RdDM pathway, such as mutants affected indifferent subunits of the RNA Pol V (i.e. nrpd2) [23], and alsofollowing pharmacological treatment with the priming agent BTH[20]. In both cases, chromatin histone activation marks appearedenriched in SA-related gene promoters. Consequently, wehypothesized that following expression of SBT3.3 SA-relateddefense genes could be poised for enhanced activation bydifferential histone modification. By using chromatin immunopre-cipitation (ChIP), we analyzed H3 Lys4 trimethylation(H3K4me3) and H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the PR-1,WRKY6 and WRKY53 gene promoter region in both Col-0 plantsand SBT3.3OEX plants. The enhanced disease resistant mutantnrpd2, defective in RNA PolV activity and compromised in theRdDM pathway [23], was included as a control. On the PR-1promoter, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks increasedmore than two and three-fold, respectively in SBT3.3 overex-pressing plants when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6B). The twoactivation marks were similarly increased in nrpd2 plants, with onlysome differences in intensity (Fig. 6B). As for PR-1, the histonemarks also showed increases in the WRKY6 and WRKY53promoters in SBT3.3 overexpressing plants, and to a lesser extentin nrpd2 plants, relative to Col-0 plants (Fig. 6B). Therefore,chromatin marks normally associated with active genes abound inthe promoter regions of SA-related genes in SBT3.3 overexpress-ing plants, although gene activation does not occur in these plants.The marks appear to serve as an on-switch for priming, and helpsexplain why the same genes show enhanced induction inSBT3.3OEX plants upon pathogenic attack (Fig. 6A).SBT3.3 expression increases H3K4me3 activation marks inits own promoterResults showed the sole expression of SBT3.3 in transgenicArabidopsis plants was able to promote activation of theendogenous gene (Figure 4F). Therefore, SBT3.3 per se mightbe signaling chromatin remodeling of its own promoter as itdoes for the PR-1 gene promoter (Fig. 6B). ChIP for H3K4me3and H3K9ac marks at the SBT3.3 promoter region in SBT3.3overexpressing plants revealed that the H3K4me3 mark wasnotably increased compared to Col-0 plants, and moreover, theenhancement in H3K4me3 marks was mirrored in nrpd2 plants(Fig. 7A). However, H3K9ac marks in the SBT3.3 genepromoter did not increase in the SBT3.3 overexpressing plantsand the nrpd2 mutant when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 7A). Theseresults contrasted with the common increase of both activationmarks in the PR-1 gene (Fig. 6B), and suggested the existence ofspecific histone codes regulating gene expression. Alternatively,because the increase in H3K4me3 activation marks observed inthe SBT3.3 gene promoter between nrpd2 and SBT3.3OEXplants were matched, we reasoned that nrpd2 plants might alsocarry constitutive SBT3.3 gene expression. SBT3.3 transcriptlevel determination by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and nrpd2 plantsshowed the mutant constitutively expressing SBT3.3 (Fig. 7B).These results suggest that SBT3.3 expression is under negativeepigenetic control, and expression is relieved following inhibi-tion of RdDM. In fact, treatment of Col-0 seedlings withsulfamethazine (SMZ), a chemical suppressor of epigenetic genesilencing (i.e. RdDM) that derepress silenced genes [45],relieved SBT3.3 and promoted transcript accumulation(Fig. 7C), to levels similar to those attained in nrpd2 plants.These observations therefore support the contention of anepigenetic control towards SBT3.3, and indicate that SBT3.3acts as a positive regulator of a priming phenomenon for moreefficient deployment of immune responses. In addition, a lowconcentration (100 mM) pharmacological treatment with of thepriming agent BTH administered to Col-0 plants promoted theenhanced deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks in thePR-1 gene promoter, and to a minor extent also in WRKY6 andWRKY53 gene promoters (Fig. 7D), as was observed in previousstudies [20,23]. Similarly, BTH also induced H3K4me3activation marks, and to a less extent also of H3K9ac marks,in the SBT3.3 gene promoter in Col-0 plants. Thus, as a primingagent, BTH not only induced chromatin remodeling of SA-related genes similar to the RdDM-defective and enhancedresistance mutant nrpd2; it also mimicked SBT3.3 chromatinremodeling triggered by the SBT3.3 itself.The importance of SBT3.3 in mediating activation ofchromatin remodeling during priming induction was furtherevaluated in SBT3.3 defective plants. Figure 7D, F and G showthat BTH-mediated increases of H3K4me3 and H3K9acactivation marks in the PR-1, WRKY6 and WRKY53 genepromoters was partially impeded in sbt3.3 plant whencompared to Col-0 plants. For the SBT3.3 gene promoter(Fig. 7E), the reduction in histone activation marks followingBTH treatment of sbt3.3 plants was most dramatic. This severereduction was most notorious in the case of H3K4me3activation marks for which a full inhibition was observed inBTH-treated sbt3.3 plants when compared to BTH-treated Col-0 plants (Figure 7D). All the above observations therefore implythat the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase is an integral componentmediating establishment of primed immunity, and moreover, itappears to be targeted for negative epigenetic control of thissame mechanism.SBT3.3 and Immune PrimingPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445DiscussionPriming, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon where cellsrespond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a morerapid and robust manner, is an important component of thevarious forms of IR described in mammals [8\u201310], plants [6,18]and invertebrates [11]. Despite the importance of priming, thesignal component(s) mediating this sensitized state remain elusive.The sensitized state is in part explained by presumably dormant orsilent component characters, which accumulate during priming,and are required only after pathogenic challenge [18]. In thisrespect, pre-stress deposition of two MPK family members ofsignaling enzymes, MPK3 and MPK6, has been described to playan important role for priming in Arabidopsis [12]. However, itremains undetermined whether or not activation of additionalfactors operating upstream of the two MPKs is required toestablish priming.Reverse genetic analysis was applied to identify the ArabidospsisSBT3.3 gene, encoding a serine protease of the subtilisin clan,which is pivotal in control of a priming mechanism that leads tosensitization for activation of SA-dependent defense responses andIR. SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plantselicited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. However, thisenhanced resistance was not preceded by a high constitutiveexpression of SA-responsive genes as occurs in different diseaseresistant mutants, which in general carry associated dwarfism, suchas in cpr1, edr1 or csb3 [26, and references therein] to mention afew. Instead, the SBT3.3-mediated resistance can be explained byaccelerated and heightened activation of SA-responsive genes,only elicited by pathogen inoculation, therefore mimicking a wildtype plant activated for priming. This phenotype is blocked in asid2 mutant background, which lacks SA, and is also blocked in thenpr1 mutant affected in signaling downstream of SA. SBT3.3 thusfunctions as a positive regulator of innate immunity operatingupstream of the SA pathway. Consistent with the gain-of-functionphenotype, SBT3.3 suppression impairs induction of SA-respon-sive genes and causes enhanced susceptibility to infection bypathogens.Interestingly, SBT3.3 expression is rapidly demanded duringactivation of innate immunity preceding the activation of SA-responsive genes. However, in contrast to PR genes, SBT3.3expression does not require the SA pathway through the NPR1regulator. Moreover, SBT3.3 activation responds very rapidly toH2O2, a common ROS species generated very early during PAMPrecognition by PRR leading to activation of innate immuneresponses. Consistent with other early induced and SA-indepen-dent genes [46], H2O2 might be the first signal for earlytranscriptional reprogramming of SBT3.3. Congruently, Daudi etal. [47] showed that knocking down the Arabidopsis cell wallperoxidases PRX33/PRX34, required for apoplastic H2O2generation during innate immune responses, leads to changes inthe cell wall proteome with depletion of various PAMP-elicitedFigure 6.

LocalizedSBT3.3 expression in the heterologous N. benthamiana system led toexpression of the endogenous P69 homologue. Similarly, its stableexpression in transgenic plants also led to activation of theendogenous SBT3.3 gene by what appears to be a self-inductionmechanism, which adds further novelty to the SBT3.3 activationmode. We hypothesize that to a subsequent initial activation by apathogen, the expressed SBT3.3 subtilase could initiate a signalingprocess, which would lead to its own expression, at least to acertain threshold level, as if forming a regulatory positive feedbackloop circuit. Maintenance of this expression threshold level shouldbe sufficient to keep cells in a sustained sensitized mode. Theautonomous and sustained SBT3.3 expression pattern shouldconsequently be the basis to explain the memory-based charac-teristics of priming and IR, manifested only secondarily in hostsafter a primary infection. Thus, SBT3.3 appears key in regulatingthis type of training effect leading to IR. Interestingly, MPK3 andMPK6 activation, and to a lesser extend also MPK4/MPK11,were enhanced in SBT3.3OEX plants following infection withPsDC3000, and conversely, this activation was compromised insbt3.3 plants. These results are congruent with increased OXI1expression in SBT3.3OEX plants, a kinase required for MPK3 andMPK6 activation [33], and indicates that following SBT3.3expression, plants respond faster to pathogenic stimuli. Becausethe MPK3 and MPK6 activation is critical for priming [12], andactivation requires OXI1 expression [33], our data suggestSBT3.3 positively modulates immune responses upstream of theMAPK kinase pathway, and confirms that accumulation ofdefense signaling components, such as SBT3.3 itself, prior to asecondary pathogen challenge is essential for priming and inducedresistance.Similarly, the observation that sole SBT3.3 expression poisesSA-responsive defense genes for enhanced activation followingperception of a pathogenic cue provides further support to SBT3.3as an integral component in mounting primed immunity. ChIPassays revealed this poising effect for enhanced gene expressiontriggered by SBT3.3 was mediated by selective increases of histoneactivation marks on the promoter region of SA-responsive genes.Since similar histone activation marks have been found to appearin SA\u2013related genes when wild type plants are treated with thepriming agent BTH [20], our data therefore strongly support amodel where SBT3.3 positively mediates OXI1-mediated MPKactivation, and concurrent chromatin remodeling at SA-respon-sive genes as specific hallmarks for primed immunity. Further-more, the observation that immune priming, and similarchromatin remodeling of SA-responsive genes is mirrored inplants defective in the RdDM pathway [23] provides support for ahypothesis that the observed SBT3.3-mediated priming mecha-nism might be under similar epigenetic control. Moreover, the factthat SBT3.3 gene expression is constitutively up in the nrpd2mutant favors this interpretation. Furthermore, (1) the observationthat histone activation marks are established in the promoter of theSBT3.3 gene and in the promoters of SA-dependent genes byindividual SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic plants; (2) thereproducibility of similar chromatin remodeling of the SBT3.3gene promoter in nrpd2 plants; (3) its similar remodeling in Col-0plants following BTH treatment; (4) and the observation that suchchromatin remodeling is strongly abrogated in sbt3.3 plants,further substantiates the importance of SBT3.3 gene activation asa prerequisite for establishment of immune priming.Figure 7.

Onesimple explanation is via SBT3.3-mediated protein substrateprocessing that co-localizes extracellularly. This substrate couldexist in a soluble form, or be an extracellular domain (ectodomain)of a larger protein, likely functioning as a receptor located in theplasma membrane. After proteolytic shedding of the ectodomainby SBT3.3, the receptor could become activated and initiate adown stream immune signaling process. This mechanism has beenidentified as common in activating a variety of signaling processesin animal through the involvement of protease-activated receptors(PARs), a group of receptors mediating different cellular processesincluding proinflammatory responses, and is also a commonprinciple in various diseases [49]. Moreover, the proteolyticprocessing mechanism of an extracellular substrate is reminiscentof that mediating activation of innate immunity in invertebratesthrough the transmembrane Toll receptor, or Toll-like receptors(TLRs) in humans; PRR-type receptors consisting of a leucine-richrepeat (LRR) ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and acytosolic signaling domain [Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)], whichbecomes activated only after the binding of a proteolyticallyprocessed peptide ligand (i.e. spa\u0308tzle) by complex cascades ofCLIP-domain serine proteases [50] or less common followingspecific cleavage of the receptor ectodomain by extracellularproteases [51,52]. Alternatively, SBT3.3 processes the extracellu-lar substrate and the cleaved polypeptide can be released andfunction as a ligand recognized by a nearby specific extracellularreceptor, which in turn can initiate a downstream signaling.Tornero et al., [30] reported SBT3.3 homologous P69C subtilasecan specifically process LRP in disease tomato plants, anextracellular LRR-containing protein of unknown function, andthe first subtilase substrate identified in plants. This suggestingSBT3.3 could similarly be involved in the cleavage and activationof LRR-containing proteins, including PRR-type receptors, whichin turn may activate innate immune responses. The recent findingthat the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK)-VI.2, a member of theLRR-containing superfamily of RLKs proteins existing inArabidopsis, is required for immune priming acting upstream ofMPK-mediated signaling [53] can give further support to thishypothesis.The results of the present study identified SBT3.3 as adeterminant host factor mediating activation of primed immuneresponses. Our immediate future challenge is to identify the targetsubstrate processed by this subtilase and elucidate the mechanismtransducing the substrate into a signal for immune primeactivation.Materials and MethodsPlants growth conditionsArabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown ina growth chamber (19\u201323uC, 85% relative humidity,100 mEm22sec21fluorescent illumination) on a 10-hr-light and14-hr-dark cycle. All mutants are in Col-0 background; nrpd2-2,npr1-1 and sid2-1 plants were previously described [23,26,54].sbt3.3-1, sbt3.3-2, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 mutants and SBT3.3OEX1and SBT3.3OEX2 overexpression lines were obtained from thePlant Subtilase Database Consortium (PSDB) (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcawp/psdb.html).Gene constructs and transgenic linesFor the SBT3.3-GFP overexpressing construct, a full lengthcDNA for SBT3.3 was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNApolymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and specific primersincluding Gateway adapters: BP SBT3.3 FW and BP SBT3.3 RVand recombined into pDONR207 using BP ClonaseMixII kit(Invitrogen). For the SBT3.3m-GFP construct,pDONR207+SBT3.3 vector was amplified using Phusion HotStart II polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with SBT3.3m FW andSBT3.3m RV phosphorylated primers including a T663to G663mutation. The PCR product was then digested with DpnIrestriction enzyme (Fermentas), purified by Zymoclean DNARecovery Kit (Zymo Research) and religated using T4 Ligase(Fermentas). For SBT3.3noSP-GFP construct pDONR207+SBT3.3vector was amplified with SBT3.3noSP FW and SBT3.3 RVprimers and recombined into pDONR207 as described above.After sequencing, all constructs were recombined with pB7FWGdestination vector using LR ClonaseMixII kit (Invitrogen) andintroduced into Arabidopsis (Col-0) via Agrobacterium transformation.The sid2-1 SBT3.3OEX and npr1-1 SBT3.3OEX lines weregenerated by the genetic crossing of the sid2-1 and npr1-1 mutants,respectively, with a 35S:SBT3.3 transgenic line containing a singleinsertion of the transgen. The sbt3.3 SBT3.3-GFP and sbt3.3SBT3.3m-GFP lines were generated by direct genetic transforma-tion of sbt3.3-1 plants with SBT3.3-GFP and SBT3.3m-GFP geneconstructs, respectively. The selected lines were those expressinghigher levels of the corresponding transgene as determined by RT-PCR of RNA preparations. For PCR-based detection of the sid2-1mutant allele the primers used were sid2-1 Fw and sid2-1 Rv GCAGTC CGA AAG ACG ACC TCG AG and CTA TCG AATGAT TCT AGA AGA AGC), followed by Mun I digestion of theensuing fragment (the mutant allele sid2-1 cannot be digested). ForPCR-based detection of the npr1-1 mutant allele, the primers usedwere npr1-1 Fw and npr1-1 Rv (59-ATGTCTCGAATGTACA-TAAGGC-39 and 59-CTCAGTTTCCTAATAGAGAGG-39).Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leavesAlmost fully expanded leaves were infiltrated with a suspensionof Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 bearing the relevant construct in10 mM MES pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM acetosyringone atan OD600 = 0.5. After 3 days, fluorescence was analyzed ininfiltrated leaves by confocal microscopy. For co-infiltration,Agrobacterium cultures grown separately and processed as indicatedabove, were adjusted to an O.D. = 0.5, and mixed prior toinfiltration. Agrobacterium expressing the viral silencing suppres-sor P19 was included in all infiltrations.Fluorescence microscopyGFP/YFP fluorescence in inoculated plants was monitoredusing Nikon SMZ800, and Leica MZ16F microscopes.Gene expression analysisTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and furtherpurified by lithium chloride precipitation. For reverse transcrip-tion, the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit(Fermentas Life Sciences) was used. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)amplifications and measurements were performed using an ABIPRISM 7000 sequence detection system, and SYBR-Green(Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). ACTIN2 was chosen as thereference gene. The primers used to amplify the different genesand DNA regions, and the PCR conditions employed forgenotyping T-DNA insertions, and RT-PCR and qRT-PCRexperiments are provided in the supporting information file TextS1. RT-qPCR analyses were performed at least three times usingsets of cDNA samples from independent experiments.SBT3.3 and Immune PrimingPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445Microarray hybridization and data analysisAffymetrix microarrays (Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array)containing 22,810 probe sets were used. Labeling and hybridiza-tion on the ATH1 microarrays were performed according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Global analysis ofgene expression was performed by using Affymetrix MAS5.0.SAM analysis (Significance Analysis of Microarrays softwarepackage) was conducted for A. thaliana triplicate samples betweencsb3 plants and control plants using a q value#0.05 and a foldchange cutoff $2 to identify the genes differentially expressed inthe mutant. We searched GO enrichment information for thedifferently expressed probe sets using EasyGO (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/easygo/ category_treeBrowse.html).We applied x2analysis for the biological process search, and thecutoff for false discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted using a p value of0.0001. GeneChip data set are available in a MIAME-compliantformat through GEO (accession no. GSE35507).Bacterial and oomycete bioassaysBacterial strains were grown overnight and used to infect 5-week-old Arabidopsis leaves by infiltration and bacterial growthdetermined following [23,54]. Twelve samples were used for eachdata point and represented as the mean 6 SEM of log c.f.u./cm2.H. arabidopsidis WACO9 sporangia were obtained by washingsporulating Col-0 leaves in 10 mM MgSO4, collected bycentrifugation, and resuspended in 10 mM MgSO4 to a finaldensity of 56104 sporangia per mL as described [25]. Three-week-old seedlings were challenge inoculated with H. arabidopsidis byspraying with 10 mM MgSO4 containing 56104conidiospores permL. Inoculated plants were maintained at 17uC and 100% relativehumidity. Disease symptoms were scored for about 200 leaves pertreatment at 7 days after challenge. For determining leafcolonization, infected leaves were stained with lactophenoltrypan-blue and examined microscopically at 7 days afterinoculation, as described [25] and scored on each leaf in thefollowing classes: I, no colonization; II, low tissue colonization(,25% of leaf area colonized); III, medium tissue colonization(25\u201350% of leaf area colonized); IV, high tissue colonization(.50% of leaf area colonized). Sporulation was expressed asintensity of pathogen sporulation on each leaf: I, no sporulation;II, ,50% of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; III, .50%of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; and IV, heavilycovered with sporangiophores, with additional chlorosis and leafcollapse. When indicated, oomycete spore counting was per-formed as previously described [26].Chromatin immunoprecipitationChromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation were performedas described [55]. Chip samples, derived from three biologicalreplicates, were amplified in triplicate and measured by quanti-tative PCR using primers for PR-1, WRKY6, WRKY53 and Actin2as reported [21]. The rest of primers are described in Text S1 file.All ChIP experiments were performed in three independentbiological replicates. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitationof modified histones from 2 g of leaf material were antiH3K4m3(#07-473 Millipore) and antiH3K4ac (#07-352 Millipore).Western blotProtein crude extracts were prepared by homogenizing groundfrozen leaf material with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplementedwith 5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), andprotein phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche). Protein con-centration was measured using Bradford reagent; 25 mg of totalprotein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide w/v) andtransferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filter was stained withPonceau-S after transfer, and used as a loading control.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Pie chart categorizing genes which aredifferentially expressed in Col-0 and csb3 plants.
