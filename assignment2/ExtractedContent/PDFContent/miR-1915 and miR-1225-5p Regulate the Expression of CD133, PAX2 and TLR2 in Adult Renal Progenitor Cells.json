Consortium, Valenzano, Bari, Italy, 3 Department of Science, Biologicaland Environmental Sciences and Technologies, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy, 4 Schena Foundation, European Research Center for Kidney Diseases, Valenzano, Bari,ItalyAbstractAdult renal progenitor cells (ARPCs) were recently identified in the cortex of the renal parenchyma and it was demonstratedthat they were positive for PAX2, CD133, CD24 and exhibited multipotent differentiation ability. Recent studies on stem cellsindicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of gene expression,may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically expressed inpluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues, suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal. We compared miRNAexpression profiles of ARPCs with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and renal proximal tubular cells (RPTECs) findingdistinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs. In particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated theexpression of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133 and PAX2, and important genes involved in the repairmechanisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2. We demonstrated that the expression of both the renal stem cell markers CD133 andPAX2 depends on lower miR-1915 levels and that the increase of miR-1915 levels improved capacity of ARPCs todifferentiate into adipocyte-like and epithelial-like cells. Finally, we found that the low levels of miR-1225-5p wereresponsible for high TLR2 expression in ARPCs. Therefore, together, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p seem to regulate importanttraits of renal progenitors: the stemness and the repair capacity.Citation: Sallustio F, Serino G, Costantino V, Curci C, Cox SN, et al.

This trend was observed within various medical segments,including nephrology [1\u20133]. In particular many researchersfocused their attention on the possibility of using adult renalstem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) for regenerative purposes. Thesecells exhibited multipotent differentiation ability by generatingtubular epithelial-like, osteogenic-like, adipocyte-like, and neuro-nal-like cells. When injected into mice with glycerol-induced acuterenal injury, these CD133+/CD24+ ARPCs contributed totubular regeneration [1,4\u20136].ARPCs, first identified in the renal interstitium and then inBowman\u2019s capsule, are positive for PAX2, CD133 and CD24[4,5,6\u20138]. Their expression profiles and their phenotypicalcharacteristics are very similar [7] but some specific propertiesas the inclination of tubular cells to proliferate upon tubular injuryin patients with acute or chronic tubular damage were different[6,7,9]. Moreover, markers allowing distinction between glomer-ular and tubular progenitor subpopulations have been recentlyidentified [6].Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), aclass of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation ofgene expression, may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal anddifferentiation [10]. MicroRNAs are specifically attractive candi-dates for regulating stem cell identity, which includes self-renewaland cell fate decisions, as their ability to simultaneously regulatemany targets provides a means for coordinated control of geneaction. Although direct evidence for a functional role for miRNAsin stem cell biology is just emerging, exciting hints regarding theirinvolvement based on expression patterns, predicted targets, andover-expression studies suggest that miRNAs may be one of thekey regulators [11]. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specificallyexpressed in pluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues,suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal [12,13].Expression level of several miRNAs has been correlated to thetime of stem cell differentiation, suggesting that these miRNAscould be used as markers to monitor stem cell identity anddifferentiation [12\u201314]. Furthermore, discovery of both stem celldifferentiation-related miRNAs and their potential target mRNAgenes may provide further insights about their functional roles instem cell maintenance and differentiation. To date, relatively littlePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296is known about functions of miRNAs in the kidney and inparticular in ARPCs.In this study we compared miRNA expression profiles of renalprogenitors with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and ofrenal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and founddistinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs.In particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the expres-sion of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133and PAX2, and important genes involved in the repair mecha-nisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2.ResultsIsolation and Characterization of ARPCsCD133-positive ARPCs were isolated, by magnetic sorting,from glomerular and tubular fractions of healthy cortex of kidneyremoved for renal carcinoma. Both ARPCs isolated fromglomeruli (gARPCs) and from tubular compartment (tARPCs)were positive for CD133, CD24, PAX2, BMI-1, Oct-4 and CD44(Figure 1A\u2013F, J\u2013L), previously described as markers of adult renalprogenitors [3\u20135,6,15]. However, gARPCs were positive for theCD106 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, VCAM1) expression(Figure 1M), whereas tARPCs did not express the CD106 marker(Figure 1N). However, CD34, CD105, and CD45 membraneproteins were not detectable (data not shown).Identification of Differentially Expressed miRNAs intARPCs, gARPCs and MSCs Compared to RPTECsTo identify miRNAs typically expressed in ARPCs, we analyzedtheir global expression profile in 5 different tARPC and gARPCclones by microarray technology and compared them withRPTEC and MSC global miRNA expression. Among 1205human miRNAs represented on the microarrays, we found 327miRNAs that resulted expressed between different cell types. The2-D hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysisshowed that miRNA expression profile was different amongMSCs, RPTECs and ARPCs, whereas it was very similar betweengARPCs and tARPCs (Figure 2A and 2B), even if statisticalanalysis identified some little differences. In fact, applying theBenjamini-Hochberg statistical method and selecting genesmodulated with a fold change of 2, we identified 21 miRNAsdiscriminating tARPCs from RPTECs, 41 miRNAs discriminatinggARPCs from RPTECs, 24 miRNAs discriminating tARPCs fromMSCs, 31 miRNAs discriminating gARPCs from MSCs and 30miRNAs discriminating MSCs from RPTECs (Table 1). When wecompared miRNAs modulated in tARPCs and gARPCs in respectto RPTECs with a fold change of 2, we found 14 miRNAs thatwere jointly modulated. However, 7 miRNAs were specificallymodulated in tARPCs and 27 in gARPCs (Table 2). Moreover,comparing miRNA expression of MSCs with that of tARPCs andgARPCs, we found 5 miRNAs varying in ARPCs in comparison toRPTECs that were also modulated in MSCs; 6 miRNAs were incommon between gARPCs and MSCs and 19 miRNAs wereexclusively modulated in MSCs (Figure S1 in File S1).Identification of miRNA TargetsTo study the molecular mechanisms in which miRNAs areinvolved, we performed a bioinformatic analysis to predict targetgenes of the modulated miRNAs. To reduce the number of falsepositives, we used 4 different algorithms and potential targets wereselected overlapping results and selecting gene targets predicted byat least 2 of them. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysiswe found several genes, of great interest for the stem cell biology,that were potentially targeted by some of modulated miRNAs. Inparticular, among miRNAs modulated respect to RPTECs, wefound miR-1225-5p and miR-1915 that were down-regulated intARPCs and gARPCs and predicted to regulate genes involved inthe stemness property of ARPCs, as CD133 and renal embryonictranscription factors PAX2 and PAX8, that are markers of adultrenal progenitors, the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, the toll-likereceptor 2 (TLR2), IL-8, HOXA1, some WNT genes and otherchemokines and growth factors (Figure 3, Table S1). All thesegenes have been previously found upregulated in ARPCs and havean important role in specific biological function and stemnesscharacteristics of ARPCs [1,4\u20135,7\u20139,16].Validation of miRNA Expression and in silico Analysis ofmiRNA TargetsTo validate expression results of miRNAs whose putative targetgenes were more connected with stem cell biology, we performedreal-time PCR (q-RT-PCR) for miR-1225-5p, miR-1915, miR-371-5p and miR-196a on miRNAs isolated from ARPCs of anindependent set of 5 tARPCs, 5 gARPCs clones and 3 RPTEClines. The expression of all analyzed miRNAs was significantlylower in stem/progenitor cell lines, confirming microarray results(Figure 4).To deepen the biological interaction among miRNAs andamong genes targeted by miRNAs that were found modulated inARPCs, we performed a new bioinformatics analysis on pathwaysand biological processes in which target genes of miRNAs wereinvolved. We considered target genes of miRNAs that were jointlymodulated in tARPCs and gARPCs respect to RPTECs andgenes-miRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Amongsignificant canonical pathways we found WNT/b-catenin signal-ling, ERK5 signalling, growth hormone signalling and glutamatemetabolism (Figure S2A in File S1), however among significantbiological processes we found cellular growth proliferation, cellularand organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-cellsignalling and interaction (Figure S2B in File S1). Moreover,merging miRNAs with ARPC modulated genes resulting from thegene expression profile published in our previous work [7] (GEOSeries Accession Number GSE8611), we found that miRNAs werestrongly interconnected with the expressed mRNAs with aninverse pairs expression relationships (Table S2) and two specificsignificant networks, involving the WNT/B-catenin and Frizzledsignalling, were identified (Figure S3 and S4 in File S1). Then, westudied the biological interaction among miRNAs modulated inMSCs and genes targeted by miRNAs, again taking advantage ofour previous gene expression data. We considered only genes-miRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Amongsignificant canonical pathways we found Inhibition of matrixmetalloproteases, WNT/b-catenin signalling, PTEN signalling,regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Figure S5A inFile S1). Among significant biological processes we found cellularmovement, cellular growth proliferation, cell death and survival,cellular and organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-cell signalling and interaction (Figure S5B in File S1). miRNAs andgenes more contributing to these biological processes formed twosignificant networks represented in Figure S6 and S7 in File S1.miR-1915 Regulates both the CD133 and PAX2Expression in tARPCsThe CD133 is known as the most important marker of renalprogenitor cells, however the genetic basis of its expression in stemcells are unknown. Our in silico analysis showed that the miR-1915downregulation in ARPCs in respect to differentiated renal tubularcells could be the cause of the CD133 overexpression. To confirmmiRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296that the miR-1915 was able to modulate the expression of theCD133 mRNA, we performed transient transfection experimentsusing an independent group tARPC clones. We increased theamount of the endogenous miR-1915 within cells, transfectingshort RNA sequences that mimic the action of the miRNA, inorder to simulate the situation found in RPTECs, that have higherlevels of miR-1915. tARPCs, transfected with 25 nM miR-1915mimic, showed a 1.5 fold reduction of endogenous CD133 mRNAlevels (p,0.01, Figure 5A). Since the same miRNA was found bybioinfomatic analysis to target also PAX2 mRNA, we checkedwhether miR-1915 mimic lowered also its levels and found thattransfection with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic caused a 1.5 fold PAX2mRNA levels reduction too (p,0.0003, Figure 5B). Moreover,transfecting tARPCs with the 50 nM miR-1915 mimic twice at adistance of three days, on the sixth day from the first transfectionwe obtained a large reduction of CD133 protein surfaceexpression (8% vs 96% of mock transfection control, Figure 5C).The transiently transfection of renal progenitors with 100 nMmiR-1915 mimic led also to strong decrease of endogenous PAX2protein expression (2 fold, p,0.02 Figure 5D) on the sixth dayfollowing miRNA mimic induction. All together our resultsshowed that miR-1915 regulated the expression of both CD133and PAX2, the two most important stemness markers of ARPCs.miR-1915 Upregulation Favors tARPC DifferentiationTo study whether miR-1915, affecting CD133 and PAX2expression, influenced also renal progenitor differentiation capac-Figure 1.

However, no significant difference was found in ZO-1 markerexpression between mimic-transfected and mock-transfectedtARPCs after 20 days of culture in epithelial differentiationmedium (Figure 6L, N,O and Figure S8B in File S1). Nevertheless,we found an increase of both ZO-1 and CK-19 expression intARPCs transfected with the miR-1915 mimic and cultured for 20days in maintenance medium respect to mock transfected cells(Figure 6F, H, J and 6K, M, O, respectively and Figure S8 in FileS1). Moreover, we found also increased levels of aquaporin 1 andaminopeptidase A transcripts in mimic-transfected tARPCsfollowing epithelial differentiation (Figure S9 in File S1).miR-1225-5p Regulates TLR2 Expression in tARPCsOur bioinformatics analysis identified a putative miR-1225-5pbinding element in the 39 UTR of TLR2 transcript, a key gene ofdamage signalling found up-regulated in ARPCs and that can giverise to repair processes in acute renal tubular damage [7,16]. Toexamine whether miR-1225-5p downregulation led to TLR2overexpression in tARPCs, we increased the miRNA levelstransfecting renal progenitors with the miR-1225-5p mimic tosimulate the higher levels of this miRNA in RPTECs. We foundthat the transfection with 25 nM miR-1225-5p mimic led, after 24hours, to a reduction of 1.3 fold of the TLR2 mRNA expression(p,0.01, Figure 7A). Moreover, the increase of the miR-1225-5plevels (50 nM) completely prevented the TLR2 protein expression,compared to mock-transfected cells, 3 days after transfection(Figure 7B\u2013C). All together these results show that, in tARPCs,TLR2 mRNA is regulated by miR-1225-5p.DiscussionmiRNAs may be one of the key regulators of the stem cellidentity, including self-renewal and cell fate decisions, thanks totheir ability to simultaneously regulate many targets that providesa means for coordinated control of gene action [10\u201314]. Here wefound distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed bothin tARPCs and gARPCs. Among them, we found some miRNAswhose target genes overlapped with genes that were modulated incomparison to RPTECs in our previous works and whoseexpression resulted inverse respect to modulated genes [7\u20138,16].Some of these miRNAs were predicted to target genes involved inthe regulation of WNT/B-catenin signals, such as FZD5,SLC6A6, and HOXA9 (Figure S2 and S3 in File S1).In stem cells WNT signals are transduced to the canonicalpathway for cell fate determination and to the noncanonicalpathway for control of cell movement and tissue polarity. Targetgenes of WNT signaling cascades are determined in a context-dependent manner due to expression profile of transcriptionfactors and epigenetic status [17\u201318]. Canonical WNT signals aretransduced through Frizzled family receptors and LRP5/LRP6coreceptor to the b-catenin signaling cascade. WNT, fibroblastgrowth factor (FGF), Notch, Hedgehog, and transforming growthfactor b/bone morphogenetic protein signaling networks areimplicated in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by regulatingself-renewal of normal stem cells as well as proliferation ordifferentiation of progenitor (transit-amplifying) cells, regulatingthe balance between stem and progenitor cells [17\u201318]. Specifi-cally, Fzd5 can regulate WNTs, interpreting WNT signals duringembryonic mesoderm and neural induction [19\u201320]. Moreover, itis known that HOXA9 shows positive regulation of genes in theWnt pathway important for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal[21].Among many miRNAs modulated in ARPCs, we focused inparticular on two of them, the miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p, thatwere interesting since together were predicted to target severalmarkers typical ARPCs, such as CD133, PAX2, PAX-8, CD44[1,4\u20135,7] and several genes found over-expressed in ARPCs, suchas TLR2, inhibin, cyclin D1, BMP receptor 2, IL-8 and MCP-1[7\u20138,16]. We demonstrated that in renal progenitors theexpression of both the stem cell markers CD133 and PAX2depends, at least in part, on lower miR-1915 levels.CD133, a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein, is a marker foradult stem cells in various tissues and tumor types. Stem cellspecificity is maintained by tight regulation of CD133 expressionat both transcriptional and post-translational levels but very little isknown about its regulation and its molecular function [22\u201324].However, PAX2, a transcription factor critical for kidneydevelopment [25] is another important marker of ARPCs that isalso re-expressed in tubular cells damaged by renal toxins [26\u201327].Moreover it has been shown that Activin/Inhibin A signalingcan regulate the expression of PAX2 and can induce an immaturephenotype in tubular cells [28].We found that the increase of levels of miR-1915 improvedcapacity of tARPCs to differentiate into adipocyte-like andepithelial-like cells, suggesting that the down-regulation ofCD133 and PAX2 expression led renal progenitors to be moreprone to differentiation.Another important key gene of ARPCs is TLR2 since theengagement of the receptor that it codifies can activate renalprogenitors leading to increase secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1chemokines and enhancing differentiation capacity of renal stem/progenitor cells [7]. Moreover, the TLR2 plays an important rolein the acute tubular cell injury: it can work as a sensor of theFigure 3. Principal genes predicted to be targeted by miR-1225-5p and miR-1915.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068296.g003miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296damage and drive tARPCs to repair damaged RPTECs bysecretion of Inhibin-A and microvesicle-shuttled Decorin andCyclinD1 [16]. We showed that the low levels of miR-1225-5p intARPCs were responsible for high TLR2 expression and foundthat the same miRNA was predicted to regulate other importantgenes found overexpressed in ARPCs, such as PAX-8, IL-8,BMPR2, IGF1, Inhibin-A, CyclinD1 and WNT1 [7\u20138,16].Therefore, together, the miR-1915 and the miR-1225-5p seemto regulate important traits of ARPCs: the stemness and the repaircapacity. Their relevance was supported by the bioinformaticanalyses showing that these two miRNAs have multiple targetgenes that are all highly interconnected and that were all foundup-regulated in renal progenitors.Further studies will be necessary to determine whether themodulation of these two miRNAs could enhance, in vivo, theregenerative capacity of ARPCs for therapeutic purposes.Materials and MethodsRenal Tissue-derived Primary Cell CulturesFresh human renal cortical tissue was harvested from patientsdiagnosed with renal carcinoma. All patients gave signed consentfor the use of their tissue for research purposes at the time ofradical nephrectomy. The study was carried out according to theprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by ourinstitutional ethics review board (Independent Ethical Committeeof Policlinic Hospital of Bari). Portions of normal-appearing cortexwere isolated surgically and examined histologically to excludepresence of carcinoma. Isolation of renal fractions was achieved asreported elsewhere [7\u20138,15\u201316], recovering both glomerular andtubular fractions. Briefly, cortex renal fractions were dissected bythe passage through a graded series of meshes steel sieves toremove the fibrous component. The cellular fraction was thenpassed through a 120-mesh sieve to isolate the capsulatedglomeruli from the tubular fraction. After several washes, thetwo isolated fractions were cultured separately in EGM-MVmedium (Lonza) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich).After 4\u20135 days, cultures were washed twice with Hanks\u2019 buffer toremove non-adherent cells and after about 1 week in culture, cellviability and number were checked. CD133-positive cells werethen isolated by magnetic cell separation technology (MACS) bymeans of CD133Ab-conjugated magnetic microbeads (MiltenyiBiotec). The eluted cells were resuspended and maintained inEGM-MV medium supplemented with 20% FBS and incubated at37uC with 5.0% CO2. After cell expansion, ARPC markers werechecked by cytofluorimetric determination and by cell immuno-fluorescence microscopy. Cytofluorimetric analysis was performedusing a Partec Flow-Max cytofluorimeter (Partec). Each determi-nation was performed on 105cells. The following antibodies wereused: PE-conjugated anti-CD133/2 (293C3), FITC-conjugatedanti-CD34, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (all from MiltenyiBiotec); FITC-conjugated anti-CD105 and FITC-conjugated anti-Figure 4.

FITC-conjugatedmouse IgG1 (Serotec) was used as an isotype control. In allcytofluorimetric determinations performed using Miltenyi anti-bodies, nonspecific sites were blocked with the FcR blockingreagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Immunofluorescence experiments wereperformed using the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-human CD133/1 mAb (clone AC133; Miltenyi Biotec), mouseantihuman CD133/2 mAb (Miltenyi Biotec), rabbit anti-humanPAX2 pAb (Covance, Princeton, NJ), mouse anti-human CD105mAb (Abcam), mouse anti-human CD24 mAb (Dako), mouse anti-human CD44 mAb (Chemicon), mouse anti-human Bmi1 mAb(Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human Oct-4 pAb (Abcam).The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 555goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, andAlexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (all from MolecularProbes).Other Cell CulturesMSCs and RPTECs were purchased from Lonza andmaintained in the recommended medium, REGM and MSCGM,respectively (Lonza). Primary RPTECs stain positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (g-GTP) and for alkaline phosphatase andcan form tubules on matrigel.miRNA IsolationTotal RNA was extracted from a minimum of 106cells/lineusing the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol. DNase treatment was carried out toremove any contaminating DNA (RNase-Free DNase Set,Qiagen).Total RNA, including small RNA fractions, was then eluted inRNase-free water. The RNA concentration was determined withNanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). ThemiRNAs quality was assessed by using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer(Agilent Technologies), and only samples with RNA integritynumber .8.5 were used.Figure 5. miR-1915 regulates CD133 and PAX2 in ARPCs.

Probe sets were sorted aftersignificant P-value and were adjusted to account for multipletesting using the FDR method of Benjamini-Hochberg. Todetermine the features that were differentially expressed betweentwo types of cells with a stronger statistic, we applied a filter withFDR,0.01 and a fold change .2. Two-dimensional hierarchicalclustering and PCA were performed using Genespring software(Agilent Technologies). To assess biological relationships amonggenes, we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA,Ingenuity System; http://www.ingenuity. com). IPA computes ascore for each network according to the fit of the set of suppliedfocus miRNAs/genes. These scores indicate the likelihood of focusgenes to belong to a network versus those obtained by chance. InIPA, the Expression Pairing tool was then applied to display themicroRNA-mRNA pairs, and to filter down the pairs with inverseexpression relationships.miRNA targets were predicted by means of miRBase 17.0(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) [29], TargetScan 5.2 (http://www.targetscan.org/) [30], PicTar (http://pictar.org) [31] and RNA221.0 (http://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22v1.0) [32] algorithms. Thealgorithms interrogated the databases by searching for thepresence of conserved 8mer and 7mer sites that match the seedregion of each miRNA at 3\u2019-UTR, 5\u2019-UTR or coding sequences.The scanning algorithms were based on sequence complementar-ity between the mature miRNA and the target site, binding energyof the miRNA\u2013target duplex, and evolutionary conservation of thetarget site sequence and target position in aligned homologousgenes. Potential targets were chosen overlapping results from thefour algorithms and selecting gene targets predicted by at least 2 ofthem and based on a score cutoff computed by a weighted sum ofa number of sequence and context features of the predictedmiRNA:mRNA duplex. Bioinformatic analysis to study thepotential binding sites of miRNAs in CD133 target mRNA wascarried out by the RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de) [33]. In general, the program finds the energeticallymost favorable hybridizations of a small RNA to a large RNA by athorough statistical analysis of minimum free energies (MFEs).We evaluated statistical significance with the Student\u2019s t test forcomparisons between 2 mean values. Pearson\u2019s correlation test wasused to study continuous variables. All values were expressed asthe mean6SD of data obtained from at least three independentexperiments. Results were considered statistically significant atp,0.05.Quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA, including small RNA fractions, was reversetranscribed with miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen)following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT PCR) for the quantification of miRNAs was carried out withmiScript Primer Assays and miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit fromQiagen. Real-time PCR amplification reactions were performed intriplicate in 25 ml of final volume via SYBR Green chemistry oniCycler (Bio-Rad).Normalization was performed with a small nucleolar RNA U6endogenous control. Comparative real-time PCR was performedin triplicate, including no-template controls. Relative expressionwas calculated using the 22DCtmethod.For CD133, PAX2 and TLR2 expression analysis, total RNAwas reverse transcribed with QuantiTect Reverse TranscriptionKit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantita-tive RT-PCR amplification reactions were performed in triplicatein 25 ml final volumes using SYBR Green chemistry on an iCycler.Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTectPrimer Assay and the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR mix(Qiagen). Genes were amplified according to the manufacturer\u2019sdirections. The b-actin gene amplification was used as a referencestandard to normalize the target signal. Relative expression wascalculated using the 22DCtmethod.miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p Mimic TransfectionFor each transfection, tARPCs and gARPCs were cultured at1*105cells per well in a 6-well plate with EGM-MV with 20%FBS at 37uC in 5% CO2. The transfection of miRNA mimic wascarried out using TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus) inaccordance with manufacturer\u2019s procedure. All miRNA mimicswere purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Intransfection experiments a mock-transfection control was per-formed by putting cells through the transfection procedure withoutadding miRNA. The validated nonsilencing siRNA sequenceAllStars Negative Control siRNA (50 nM, Qiagen) and the Syn-hsa-miR-1 miScript miRNA Mimic (25 nM, Qiagen) were used asnegative control and positive control, respectively, for the setup ofmiRNA mimic transfections. Each transfection experiment wasdone in triplicate. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24hours for total RNA extraction. For the protein analysis, cells weretransfected twice at a distance if 3 days and the protein expressionwas assayed 6 days after the first transfection.Flow Cytometric AnalysisThe CD133 protein surface expression, after transfection, wasdetermined by flow cytometric analysis. ARPCs were washed andresuspended in FACS buffer and incubated with PE-conjugatedanti-CD133/2 (293C3) (Miltenyi Biotec). Non-specific sites wereblocked with the FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Cellswere analyzed on a \u2018\u2018EPICS XL\u2019\u2019 Flow Cytometer (BeckmanCoulter). The area of positivity was determined using an isotype-matched mAb, a total of 104events for each sample were acquired.Western Blot AnalysisThe amount of PAX2, after transfection, was determined byWestern blotting analysis. Total protein extracts were preparedwith RIPA lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1.5% NonidetP-40, 1 mM sodiumorthovanadate, plus proteinase inhibitors. The protein concentra-tion was determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). 80 mg ofeach protein lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE andtransferred to polyvinyldene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Milli-pore). The membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat milk powderdiluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (T-PBS) for 2 h atroom temperature (RT) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti\u2013PAX2 antibody (Novus Biologicals) in blocking buffer overnight at4uC. Finally, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodyof horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (SantaCruz). Immunocomplexes were detected with ECL method (GEHealthcare). The same membranes were stripped and reprobedwith anti- b-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma).Images of autoradiography were acquired using a scannerEPSON Perfection 2580 Photo (EPSON) and quantified by ImageJ 1.34 Software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

The immune complexes were identifiedafter the incubation of the cells with the specific secondaryantibodies (Alexa Flour 488 and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouseIgG, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells werewashed in PBS after each step, counterstained with To-pro-3(Molecular Probes), mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomeda), and sealedwith nail varnish. Negative controls were obtained by incubatingcells with the blocking solution and then omitting the primaryantibody. The stained cells were viewed under the Leica TCS SP2(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscopeusing x40 and x63 objective lenses. Fluorescence levels werequantified and expressed as area fraction (%).DifferentiationTo evaluate the effects of the miR-1915 on ARPCs differen-tiation, the ARPCs were transfected with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic(Dharmacon) at the first day of differentiation and every 7 days.The undifferentiated and untransfected cells were used as negativecontrols.The extrarenal differentiation experiments were performedusing the adipogenic induction/maintenance medium and osteo-genic differentiation medium (Lonza), according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions. For adipogenic differentiation, 3 cycles ofinduction/maintenance were performed. Each cycle consisted ofculturing ARPCs in induction medium for 3 d and in maintenancemedium for 1\u20133 d. After 3 complete cycles, the cells were culturedfor seven more days in adipogenic maintenance medium,replacing the medium every 2\u20133 d. At the end of the treatmentthe lipid vacuoles were stained with Oil red-O (Sigma). Briefly,cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehydefor 15 min, rinsed with PBS and incubated with Oil red-O for30 min.Epithelial differentiation was obtained by culturing ARPCs incommercially available REGM medium (Lonza) supplementedwith 50 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (Sigma) for 20 days.Tubular cells were identified by the expression of CK-19 and ZO-1 in immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human ZO-1 poly-clonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-human CK-19 mAb (Novus Biologicals).Supporting InformationFile S1 Figure S1.
