"Poison Domains Block Transit of Translocated Substrates via theLegionella pneumophila Icm/Dot SystemWhitney M. Amyot,b,c Dennise deJesus,b,c Ralph R. Isberga,bHoward Hughes Medical Institute,a Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology,b and Graduate Program in Molecular Microbiology, Sackler School of GraduateBiomedical Science,c Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USALegionella pneumophila uses the Icm/Dot type 4B secretion system (T4BSS) to deliver translocated protein substrates to the hostcell, promoting replication vacuole formation. The conformational state of the translocated substrates within the bacterial cell isunknown, so we sought to determine if folded substrates could be translocated via this system. Fusions of L. pneumophila Icm/Dot-translocated substrates (IDTS) to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or ubiquitin (Ub), small proteins known to fold rapidly,resulted in proteins with low translocation efficiencies. The folded moieties did not cause increased aggregation of the IDTS anddid not impede interaction with the adaptor protein complex IcmS/IcmW, which is thought to form a soluble complex that pro-motes translocation. The translocation defect was alleviated with a Ub moiety harboring mutations known to destabilize itsstructure, indicating that unfolded proteins are preferred substrates. Real-time analysis of translocation, following movementduring the first 30 min after bacterial contact with host cells, revealed that the folded moiety caused a kinetic defect in IDTStranslocation. Expression of an IDTS fused to a folded moiety interfered with the translocation of other IDTS, consistent with itcausing a blockage of the translocation channel. Furthermore, the folded protein fusions also interfered with intracellulargrowth, consistent with inefficient or impaired translocation of proteins critical for L. pneumophila intracellular growth. Thesestudies indicate that substrates of the Icm/Dot T4SS are translocated to the host cytosol in an unfolded conformation and thatfolded proteins are stalled within the translocation channel, impairing the function of the secretion system.Legionella pneumophila is a pathogen of amoebae that grows inan intravacuolar niche in these cells (1\u20134). Upon aerosol-ization of contaminated water supplies, inhalation of L. pneu-mophila and subsequent internalization by alveolar macro-phages lead to disease (2, 5, 6). The bacterium replicates withina membrane-bound vacuole in macrophages that is identical tothe replication compartment found in amoebae (7). Formationof the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) requires a func-tional type IV secretion system (T4SS) known as the Icm/Dotcomplex (8, 9), which transports a massive collection of effec-tors into the host cytosol. To date, over 275 of these proteinsubstrates have been identified (10\u201319). Shortly after internal-ization of the bacteria into either macrophages or amoebae,mitochondria and markers of the endoplasmic reticulum arerecruited to the LCV to establish a vacuole that allows replica-tion before the cell lyses, releasing bacteria into the extracellu-lar milieu for a second round of infection (20\u201322).Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are utilized by a wide varietyof Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to translocate effec-tor molecules across the bacterial membrane. This diverse groupof secretion complexes is defined by ancestral relatedness to bac-terial conjugation machines that are able to translocate nucleicacids, proteins, and nucleoprotein complexes (23\u201326). T4SS canbe broadly classified into two subgroups based on similarity to thearchetypal Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 (VirB/D4)complex (24). Type IVA systems (T4ASS) share significant simi-larity to the VirB/D4 system and can be found in pathogens suchas Helicobacter pylori and Brucella abortus (24, 25). The type IVBsystems (T4BSS) are distinct from the VirB/D4 system and are bestrepresented by Legionella species and Coxiella burnetii (24, 25, 27,28). Although sequence similarities may be limited between theT4ASS and T4BSS members, there is evidence for functional con-servation between these two subclasses as both appear to have coreprotein components that form a complex spanning the inner andouter membranes of Gram-negative organisms (29\u201331). In addi-tion, each has a coupling ATPase complex, which is thought to actas a receptor for translocated substrates, transferring them toother components of the secretion system as a first step in transitto target cells (32).In L. pneumophila, the earliest steps in the translocation pro-cess involve interactions between the Icm/Dot-translocated sub-strate (IDTS) and the IcmS/IcmW chaperone (33, 34), which is asoluble heteromeric component of the (IcmS/W) apparatus. AsIcmS/W associates with the coupling ATPase complex DotL/DotM/DotN, it is likely that this five-member multiprotein com-plex presents translocated substrates to core secretion systemcomponents that span the bacterial envelope. Inactivating muta-tions in IcmS or IcmW result in highly reduced efficiencies oftranslocation of most IDTSs although a subset appears to translo-cate into host cells independently of this chaperone. It is likely thatstructural determinants control the dependence on IcmS/W fortranslocation of a protein and that IDTSs are capable of interact-ing directly with the secretion system in the absence of the chap-erone. The critical components of the translocated substrates thatallow Icm/Dot recognition are still somewhat obscure although itis clear that each IDTS contains a carboxyl-terminal signal of lessReceived 2 May 2013 Returned for modification 2 June 2013Accepted 13 June 2013Published ahead of print 24 June 2013Editor: A.

Both short polar amino acids and a glutamate-richregion appear to be common sequence determinants for this sig-nal (13, 19, 35). The proteins that recognize this signal and targetthe protein to the complex are not known.In many secretion systems, there are determinants other thanthe recognition signal that are required for successful movementthrough the membrane. In Escherichia coli, chimeric proteins thatfused secretion signal sequences onto normally cytoplasmic pro-teins resulted in \u201cjamming\u201d of the secretion apparatus, presum-ably by entry of an impassable substrate into the secretion channel(36). Similarly, translocation of proteins from the cytosol intomitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes can all be blocked byintroduction of tightly folded protein moieties into coding se-quences, consistent with there being a secretion-competent con-formation required for translocation (37\u201339). The necessity of asecretion-competent conformation, however, does not appear ev-ident in many systems, such as the bacterial twin-arginine trans-location (Tat) pathway and the eukaryotic peroxisomal importpathway, in which the insertion of folded domains has no effect ontranslocation (40\u201342).Specialized bacterial secretion systems that deliver proteins totarget cells provide a very special problem for maintaining a secre-tion-competent conformation. The translocated substrates ofthese systems are often synthesized and stored prior to contact ofbacteria with their secretion targets, and a large bolus of proteinmust be injected via these systems quickly. In spite of these issues,there is evidence that a tightly folded moiety interferes with trans-location of type III secretion substrates, either because it is rejectedby the complex or jams the apparatus (43, 44). There is also someevidence that in the case of some proteins, the secretion apparatusitself can unfold a substrate, converting a nontranslocatable forminto a secretion-competent conformation (45, 46). In contrast,little is known regarding the tertiary structure of T4SS substrates,and structural analysis of the T4ASS core complex does not nec-essarily demand that substrates be unfolded prior to entering intothe channel (30, 47). In this study, we investigate whether the L.pneumophila Icm/Dot system can tolerate substrates containingdomains known to poison secretion by other translocation appa-ratuses. The results obtained are consistent with the presence ofconformational states that interfere with efficient translocation.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains, plasmids, and cell culture. All bacterial strains andplasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. All PCR primers used inthis work are available from the authors. Growth medium for L. pneumo-phila was as described previously (8, 48). For L. pneumophila, chloram-phenicol was used at a concentration of 20 \ufffdg/ml. For E. coli strains,antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 40 \ufffdg/ml; ampicillin, 100 \ufffdg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 30 \ufffdg/ml.L. pneumophila strain Lp02 (thyA-hsdR rpsL) (49), a thymine (Thy)-auxotrophic derivative of the Philadelphia-1 isolate, was used as the wildtype in experiments. Lp03 (Lp02 dotA03) was used as a translocation-deficient control where indicated (49). The icmS deletion mutant (Lp02\ufffdicmS) was generated as previously described (50).All CyaA fusions were constructed by cloning IDTS open reading frames(ORFs) into pJB2581 (51). Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusions wereconstructed by inserting the coding sequence of Mus musculus dhfr (GenBankNM_010049.3) into pJB2581, in between the cyaA and IDTS sequences unlessotherwise indicated. Fusions were generated using splicing by overlap exten-sion PCR (SOE-PCR). Ubiquitin fusions were constructed similarly to thosewith DHFR, using the 67-amino-acid monomer of ubi4p from Saccharomycescerevisiae S288c (NM_001181859.1). FLAG-tagged fusions were constructedby adding FLAG sequence (ATG-GATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG)to the amino terminus of IDTS ORFs by PCR and cloning into pJB908.The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IcmS/IcmW plasmid (pJB5809) wasa generous gift of J. Vogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.The U937 cell line (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was passaged and differenti-ated as described previously (8). HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) weregrown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 4.5g/liter D-glucose (catalog number 11995; Invitrogen-Gibco) supplementedwith 10% heat-inactivated HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS; ThermoScientific). Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) wereprepared from the femurs of female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) ac-cording to a previously published protocol (52) and cultivated in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with glutamate (Invitrogen-Gibco) and 10%heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco). All manipulations with animals were ap-proved by the Tufts University IACUC, and the research approach wasapproved the Tufts University Institutional Biosafety Review Board.CyaA translocation assay. Translocation assays using CyaA proteinfusions were adapted from previous protocols (51). Unless otherwise in-dicated, L. pneumophila was grown overnight in AYE [N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered yeast extract] broth with appropri-ate additives to exponential phase (A600 of \ufffd2.2 to 2.4, with less than 10%of the bacteria motile). CyaA protein expression was induced with 200\ufffdM isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for anadditional 3 to 5 h until late exponential phase (A600 \ufffd3.2 to 3.6 with morethan 50% motility). A total of 2.5 \ufffd 106 phorbol ester-differentiated U937cells were incubated in 24-well plates and challenged with L. pneumophilastrains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After a 1-h incubationwith bacteria (unless otherwise indicated), U937 cells were washed threetimes with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracts were pre-pared by the addition of 200 \ufffdl of lysis buffer (50 mM HCl, 0.1% TritonX-100) and incubation on ice for 10 min. Lysates were collected, boiled for5 min, and then neutralized by the addition of 12 \ufffdl of 0.5 M NaOH.Protein was precipitated by adding 400 \ufffdl of cold 95% ethanol (EtOH)and incubated at \ufffd20\u00b0C for at least 5 min. Insoluble material was removedby centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were dried andresuspended in assay buffer, and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentrationwas measured in extracts diluted 1:500 using a GE Healthcare Life Sci-ences Biotrak cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit(RPN225). Data were normalized to the amount of the housekeepingprotein isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) or the Icm/Dot system proteinDotF to determine bacterial load, and data were expressed as a ratio of thecyclase reaction rate relative to the steady-state levels of CyaA reporterfusions in each well, as determined by Western blotting of bacterial ly-sates. Data are presented as fmol/well/[fusion protein].Antibodies used in this work. For detection of cyclase fusions byWestern blotting probing, anti-CyaA (3D1) mouse monoclonal IgG(Santa Cruz) was used at a concentration of 1:15,000 diluted in 5% milkwith a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)secondary antibody used at a concentration of 1:10,000. For detectionusing the FLA-9000 developer, anti-CyaA was used at a concentration of1:5,000 diluted in NAP (non-animal protein) Blocker (GBiosciences)with a Cy5-goat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:10,000 or Cy3-goat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:5,000 (Invitrogen). Serumspecific for Bacillus subtilis isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was gener-ously provided by A. L. Sonenshein, Tufts University Medical School,Boston, MA.Real-time assay of translocation rate. A GloSensor cAMP assay(TM076; Promega) was adapted for the real-time analysis of translocationusing L. pneumophila harboring CyaA fusions. Two days prior to infec-tion, 293T cells were resuspended at a density of 1.5 \ufffd 105 cells/ml in asolid white 96-well plate (Costar 3917) and incubated overnight. The nextday, cells were transfected with pGloSensor20F cAMP plasmid (E1171;Promega) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/\ufffdl, as well as with a plasmidAmyot et al.3240 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgexpressing Fc\ufffdRIIA at a concentration of 18.75 ng/\ufffdl, using FuGENE HD,according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 24 h of incubation, themedium was carefully removed from the 293T cells and replaced with 200\ufffdl of GloSensor cAMP reagent (E1290; Promega) equilibration medium(88% CO2-independent medium [Invitrogen 18045], 10% FBS, 2 to 3%[vol/vol] freshly thawed cAMP reagent) supplemented with 100 \ufffdg/mlthymidine and 200 \ufffdM IPTG, as necessary. The cells were incubated for 1h further at 37\u00b0C prior to challenge at an MOI of 10 with bacteria that werediluted in opsonizing medium (CO2-independent medium, 10% FBS, 100\ufffdg/ml Thy, 200 \ufffdM IPTG, and anti-Legionella antibody [1:1,000]). Thewells containing the opsonized bacteria were subjected to 5 min of cen-trifugation at 1,000 rpm and immediately placed in a luminescence platereader preheated to 37\u00b0C. Luminescence measurements were taken every2 min for up to 1 h. As a positive control, forskolin, an activator of adenylylcyclase, was added at a concentration of 10 \ufffdM. Data were recorded asrelative light units, after the subtraction of background from wells thatwere not incubated with the cAMP reagent.Determination of DHFR enzymatic activity. DHFR activity of theCyaA-IDTS fusions was measured with a colorimetric assay based on theNADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolicacid. For measurement of DHFR activity, 100-ml overnight cultures of L.pneumophila expressing IDTS fusions to murine DHFR were pelleted,resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mMEDTA, 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 200 \ufffdg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail[Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed by threefreeze-thaw cycles, alternating 1- to 2-min incubations in liquid nitrogen,TABLE 1 Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmid Genotype or relevant characteristic(s)a Oligonucleotide(s)Referenceor sourceStrainsL. pneumophilaLp01 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR 8Lp02 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR thyA mutant 8Lp03 Lp02 dotA03 8Lp02 \ufffdicmS 62E. coliDH5\ufffd \t\ufffd 80dlacZ\ufffdM15 \ufffd(lacZYA-argF)U169 recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rK\ufffd mK\ufffd)supE44 thi-1 gyrA relA1PlasmidspJB908 pMMB66EH oriRSF1010 oriT bla td\ufffdi 66pJB2581 cyaA in pJB908-td\ufffdi, Cmr 49pCyaA-DHFR pJB2581 dhfr\ufffd 35, 36 This studypCyaA-MavU pJB2581 mavU 63, 58 This studypCyaA-DHFR-MavU pCyaA dhfr mavU 63, 64, 65, 58 This studypCyaA-MavU(C50) pJB2581 mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This studypCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50) pCyaA dhfr mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This studypCyaA-MavU(C186) pJB2581 mavU(212-end) This studypCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C186) pCyaA dhfr mavU(212-end) 63, 58, 71, 72 This studypCyaA-MavU(C118) pJB2581 mavU(280-end) This studypCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C118) pCyaA dhfr mavU(280-end) 63, 58, 73, 74 This studypCyaA-MavU(C78) pJB2581 mavU(320-end) This studypCyaA-DHFR-Mavu(C78) pCyaA dhfr mavU(320-end) 64, 58, 75, 76 This studypMavU pJB908 mavU 99, 58 This studypCyaA-SidG pJB2581 sidG 60, 54b This studypCyaA-DHFR-SidG pCyaA dhfr sidG 60, 54b This studypJB-CyaA-RalF pJB2581 ralF 66, 67 This studypCyaA-DHFR-RalF pCyaA dhfr ralF 66, 67 This studypCyaA-LidA pJB2581 lidA 25, 31 This studypCyaA-DHFR-LidA pCyaA dhfr lidA 25, 31, 17, 18, 20, 21 This studypCyaA-SidC pJB2581 sidC 7, 10 This studypCyaA-DHFR-SidC pCyaA dhfr sidC 7, 10 This studypCyaA-VIpD pJB2581 vipD 22, 24 This studypCyaA-DHFR-VipD pCyaA dhfr vipD 22, 24 This studypCyaA-Ub pJB2581 ubi4p 93, 95 This studypCyaA-Ub(G3,13) pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) 94, 95 This studypCyaA-Ub-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p ralF 93, 95, 66, 67 This studypCyaA-Ub(G3,13)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) ralF 94, 95, 66, 67 This studypCyaA-Ub(V76)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(V76) ralF 108, 95 This studypFLAG-SidG pJB908 FLAG-sidG 104b, 43 This studypFLAG-SidG(Cterm) pJB908 FLAG-sidG(936-end) 43 This studypFLAG-MavU pJB908 FLAG-mavU 110 This studypFLAG-RalF pJB908 FLAG-ralF 109 This studypJB5809 pGST-IcmS/W J.

Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at15,000 \ufffd g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Total protein in the extracts was quantifiedusing a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols.For each reaction, 100 \ufffdl of protein extracts (0.5 to 1.0 mg of totalprotein) was incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mMNaCl, 5 mM \ufffd-mercaptoethanol) containing 100 \ufffdM \ufffd-2=-NADPH(Sigma) and 100 \ufffdM dihydrofolic acid (Sigma). In each reaction mixture,100 \ufffdM trimethoprim (TMP) or 100 \ufffdM methotrexate (MTX) wasadded. The substrate (dihydrofolic acid) was then added, the reactionsolution was mixed by inverting the cuvette several times; the A340 wasmeasured immediately and every 15 s thereafter for 3 min. Purified mam-malian DHFR (1.5 \ufffd 10\ufffd3 units) was used as a positive control. Specificactivity in \ufffdmol/min/mg of protein is calculated by the following formula:units/mg protein \ufffd [(\ufffdOD/minsample) \ufffd (\ufffdOD/minblank)]/\u03b5(mM\ufffd1cm\ufffd1)V (mg protein/ml), where \u03b5 is 12.3, V is the volume of enzyme (ml),and mg protein/ml is the enzyme concentration of the original sample. Tonormalize specific activity to the DHFR present in the fusions, steady-state levels of DHFR were determined by Western blotting to obtain pro-tein amounts. Quantification by densitometry compared to a standardcurve made from serial dilutions of pure DHFR on the same immunoblotwas used to determine protein concentrations.Cyclase assay on bacterial cultures. A total of 1 \ufffd 108 bacteria of eachculture were pelleted at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 190 \ufffdl of lysisbuffer (60 mM Tris [pH 8], 10 mM MgCl2, 50 \ufffdM CaCl2, 50 \ufffdg/mlDNase, 200 \ufffdg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) andincubated on ice for 45 min. Samples were lysed by three freeze-thawcycles, alternating 1 to 2 min incubations in liquid nitrogen, and a 37\u00b0Cwater bath. In both lysed and unlysed samples, cell debris was cleared bycentrifugation at 15,000 \ufffd g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. For the reaction mixture,100 \ufffdl of supernatant was mixed with 1 mM ATP in 50 mM Tris and 50\ufffdM CaCl2; 10 \ufffdM calmodulin (CaM) was added to each tube, and reac-tion mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 to 30 min before reactions werestopped with 2\ufffd stop buffer (100 \ufffdM HCl\u2013 0.2% Triton X-100) andboiling for 5 min, followed by neutralization with 12 \ufffdl of 0.5 M NaOH.Protein was precipitated with 400 \ufffdl of ice-cold 95% EtOH and incubatedat \ufffd20\u00b0C for at least 5 min. Extracts were dried under vacuum and mixedwith assay buffer, and cAMP concentration was measured as for all cyclaseassays. Data were normalized to the expression of CyaA fusions as deter-mined by steady-state levels of lysates on a Western blot and displayed asfmol/[fusion protein].Quantification of protein aggregation. Overnight cultures of L. pneu-mophila harboring fusion proteins were grown as for cyclase assays. Atotal of 2.5 \ufffd 109 bacteria were pelleted at 10,000 \ufffd g for 5 min, resus-pended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA [pH8.0], 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 200 \ufffdg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor cock-tail [Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed asdescribed for bacterial cyclase assays. Cellular debris was separated by aslow centrifugation at 3,000 \ufffd g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in500 \ufffdl 2\ufffd sample buffer and saved. Total protein samples were obtainedby mixing 80 \ufffdl of supernatant with 20 \ufffdl of 5\ufffd sample buffer. To pre-cipitate proteins, 800 \ufffdl of supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at\ufffd100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h. Pellets (aggregated proteins) were resuspended in400 \ufffdl of 2\ufffd sample buffer, and 160 \ufffdl of supernatant was mixed with 40\ufffdl of 5\ufffd sample buffer. All samples were boiled, and the equivalent of2.5 \ufffd 107 cells for each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. CyaA-IDTSprotein in each sample was detected using antibody against CyaA andquantified by densitometry. Percent aggregation was expressed as theamount of protein in the pellet fractions relative to the total protein.Copurification of the IDTS and IcmS/W complex. E. coli DH5\ufffd wastransformed with the plasmid pJB5809, encoding GST-IcmS-IcmW (J.Vogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and a second plasmid thatencodes a FLAG-tagged IDTS. A plasmid expressing GST without IcmS/IcmW was used as a control. Overnight cultures (500 ml) were grown inLB medium supplemented with kanamycin and carbenicillin. Protein ex-pression was induced by the addition of 0.5 M IPTG, and cells were incu-bated at 30\u00b0C for 3 h with slow shaking. Cultures were harvested by cen-trifugation at 10,000 \ufffd g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspendedin 10 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 1 mM dithio-threitol (DTT), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), followed by lys-ing with a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at15,000 \ufffd g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and cleared lysates were incubated with 0.5ml of glutathione beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Columns were washed three timeswith cold wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, andprotease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Bound GST-IcmS/IcmW and asso-ciated proteins were eluted with four 0.75-ml aliquots of 10 mM reducedglutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Elutions were combined and con-centrated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. All fractions weremixed with 2\ufffd sample buffer and probed after Western blotting, witheluate fractions enriched 20\ufffd.Translocation assayed by bacterial fractionation. DifferentiatedU937 cells were plated in a six-well tissue culture dish at a density of 1.5 \ufffd107 cells/well. L. pneumophila strains were cultured as for other transloca-tion assays and used to challenge U937 cells at an MOI of 5. After 1.5 h,wells were washed three times with warm medium to remove nonassoci-ated bacteria. Cells were lifted by pipetting up and down in 2 to 3 ml ofPBS, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm, resuspended in 200\ufffdl of PBS containing 0.5% digitonin and protease inhibitor cocktail(Roche), and incubated for 20 min with rotation at room temperature.The detergent lysate was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant, representing the detergent soluble fraction, wasmixed with 5\ufffd sample buffer and boiled. Pellets were further solubilizedin 2% SDS and mixed with 2\ufffd sample buffer.Intracellular growth assay. Bone marrow-derived macrophages(BMDM) from A/J mice were replated on glass coverslips in a 24-wellplate at 2 \ufffd 105 cells per well. Postexponential phase L. pneumophila wasused to challenge cells at an MOI of 1, and plates were subjected to cen-trifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm to promote bacterial association withcells. After 2 h, cells were washed with RPMI medium, and growth wasallowed to proceed for an additional 12 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS,fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and blocked in 4% goat serumin PBS. After samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, bac-teria were stained by anti-L. pneumophila rat serum and secondary anti-rat Texas Red (1:500) (Invitrogen).

The fusion of se-creted proteins to DHFR, a rapidly folding enzyme that can bestabilized in its folded conformation with folate analogs, is com-monly used to monitor whether proteins can be secreted or trans-located in a folded state (33, 37\u201339, 43, 53). To analyze if translo-cation via the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot type IVB secretionsystem can occur in the presence of folded substrates, fusions ofseveral Icm/Dot-translocated substrates (IDTSs) to the carboxylterminus of the murine DHFR were constructed. We chose fourdifferent substrates to analyze. RalF and SidG were interrogatedbecause there is considerable information regarding the nature ofthe C-terminal translocation signals of these proteins as well as theeffects of the mature protein sequences on translocation efficiency(34, 54). MavU was chosen because in a previous study we foundthat its C-terminal signal was one of the most effective targetingsequences identified among the IDTSs, so we wanted to determineif a high-efficiency signal could overcome deficits caused by thepresence of a folded domain (13). Finally, we wanted to investigatewhether the introduction of a folded domain internal to an IDTScould have different effects from placing the domain upstreamAmyot et al.3242 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgfrom the complete coding sequence. For this reason, we usedLidA, because in previous studies we had identified importantjunctions between domains in the protein that we thought wouldlikely tolerate added sequences (55).To detect translocation, each construction was tagged with thecalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase enzymatic domain en-coded by the Bordetella pertussis cyaA gene (Fig. 1A; Table 1).Production of cAMP by these constructions requires transloca-tion into eukaryotic cells as bacteria do not express calmodulin(56). Expression of these CyaA constructs was induced by theaddition of IPTG to cultures of the wild-type L. pneumophilastrain Lp02, and the bacteria were used to challenge the humanmacrophage-like cell line U937. The translocation efficiency ofeach protein fusion into target U937 cells was quantified as intra-cellular cAMP produced by the CyaA-IDTS fusions, normalizedto relative steady-state levels of the fusion within each strain (seeMaterials and Methods) (13).Each of the IDTSs tested exhibited translocation defects whenfused to DHFR (Fig. 1B), with each DHFR fusion showing trans-location levels that were between 8-fold (for DHFR-MavU) and40-fold (for DHFR-LidA) lower than the comparable fusions lack-ing the DHFR moiety. In the case of DHFR-LidA, it appeared thatDHFR totally blocked translocation; its translocation efficiencywas no greater than that observed with a mutant strain (dotA)containing a defective type IV system unable to translocate IDTS(Fig. 1B).Interestingly, the CyaA protein that was not fused to any IDTSstill translocated at levels \ufffd5-fold higher in a wild-type strain thanin a dotA mutant background (Fig. 1B), and this level was higherthan what we observed with wild-type strains harboring theDHFR-LidA fusion. The CyaA construction had a short tail addedto its carboxyl-terminal end to facilitate construction of the fu-sions, and this may have acted as a cryptic signal since the identicalconstruction lacking this short carboxyl-terminal sequenceshowed translocation levels as low as those of the dotA control (J.Vogel, personal communication). This leakage through the Icm/Dot complex was abolished when CyaA was fused to DHFR, indi-cating that the DHFR moiety alone is inhibitory to translocationthrough the Icm/Dot complex even when a cryptic translocationsignal is present in a protein (Fig. 1B).There was considerable translocation of the protein having aDHFR fusion to MavU, presumably due to the extremely effectiveC-terminal signal, so we tested whether the relatively high levels oftranslocation were due to protein structure or the nature of thesignal. To this end, serial amino-terminal deletions of the L. pneu-mophila IDTS MavU (Lpg1798) were constructed to selectivelyremove domains in the protein. MavU is a 398-amino-acid pro-tein predicted to contain a Rho-GTPase-activating protein(RhoGAP) domain and a coiled-coil region (Fig. 2A). Therefore,truncations were made immediately downstream of the RhoGAPdomain (Fig. 2, C186), flanking the predicted coiled-coil domain(C118 and C78), and just upstream of the predicted disorderedcarboxyl terminus (C50) (Fig. 2A; Table 1). CyaA fusions to thesetruncated proteins were all similarly expressed, and all exhibitedtranslocation efficiencies that were similar to the translocationefficiency of the full-length MavU (Fig. 2B and C, black bars).Translocation of each of the truncated proteins fused to DHFRwas then determined relative to the amount of full-length steady-state protein found on gels (see Materials and Methods). All ofthese DHFR fusion proteins were translocated at similar levels andshowed similar levels of defects, consistent with the idea that aspecific protein structure cannot ameliorate DHFR-mediatedtranslocation defects (Fig. 2C). The observation that translocationof CyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50), encoding only the C-terminal 50amino acids of MavU, was similar to that of the full-length MavU-DHFR fusion indicates that the sensitivity of an IDTS to translo-cation inhibition resulting from insertion of the DHFR moietydoes not depend on the size of the hybrid protein but may beconnected to the efficiency at which the C-terminal signal canallow recognition by the Icm/Dot translocation system.The DHFR moiety in IDTS fusions is enzymatically active. Inmany of the previous studies examining the effects of protein fold-ing on secretion, a DHFR inhibitor such as methotrexate (MTX),which inhibits both mammalian and bacterial proteins, was nec-essary to stabilize the DHFR in a folded conformation (37). AsDHFR blocked IDTS translocation in the absence of MTX, wetested whether the inhibitor would cause further depression oftranslocation and whether the enzyme was folded in an activeconfirmation, consistent with its ability to block translocation. Asexpected, MTX had no effect on the growth in culture of the thymutant strain used in these studies (data not shown). Further-FIG 1 Insertion of DHFR interferes with translocation. (A) Schematic repre-sentation of CyaA-IDTS fusion proteins used in translocation assays. For fu-sions containing the DHFR moiety, DHFR was fused to the carboxyl terminusof CyaA immediately upstream of an IDTS or translocation signal. (B) Thepresence of DHFR inhibits translocation. Translocation levels of the IDTSwere quantified by measuring intracellular cAMP levels resulting from CyaA.The wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 (black and gray bars) or the trans-location-defective dotA strain (striped bar) expressing the indicated CyaA pro-tein fusions was used to challenge U937 cells. After 1 h, intracellular cAMPlevels were determined by ELISA in cell lysates (see Materials and Methods).The values represent the mean cAMP determined in seven separate experi-ments (21 independent infections), normalized to the amount of the T4SSprotein DotF and steady-state levels of CyaA in the vector-alone control absentthe IDTS, as determined by immunoblotting of bacterial lysates.

This raised the possibility that the DHFR moiety was notassuming the conformation of the native active protein in theseprotein fusions. Therefore, to determine whether DHFR placedwithin the chimeric proteins was in its native folded form, wetested if the derivatives were enzymatically active.DHFR activity of the CyaA-IDTS fusions was measured using acolorimetric assay that detects the NADPH-dependent reductionof dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid (Fig. 3A) (see Materialsand Methods). Cell lysates of L. pneumophila expressing CyaA-DHFR-IDTS fusions were incubated with NADPH and dihydro-folic acid, and the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate was measured(see Materials and Methods). To determine the specific activity,the rate of hydrolysis as a function of protein concentration wasdetermined by quantitating the amount of fusion protein ex-pressed for each sample (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 3B).Trimethoprim was added to eliminate the endogenous L. pneu-mophila DHFR activity as, unlike MTX (57), this antibiotic inhib-its the prokaryotic protein specifically and has no effect on themammalian DHFR present in the fusions (Fig. 2C). The specificactivities of DHFR in the protein fusions were comparable tothose of purified DHFR, consistent with proper folding of thismoiety (Fig. 2C). As expected, no activity was seen in a CyaA-IDTS fusion that did not have DHFR, and the enzymatic activity inFIG 2 Serial truncations of MavU fused to DHFR exhibit equivalent defects intranslocation competence. (A) A schematic of MavU fusions to CyaA andDHFR (top) and of the MavU protein with the RhoGAP domain (light gray),coiled-coil domain (white box), and predicted disordered carboxyl terminus(black) (bottom) is shown.

(B) Immunoblot of L. pneumo-phila soluble extracts from strains overexpressing CyaA-MavU (lane 1) or twodifferent cultures of CyaA-DHFR-MavU proteins (lanes 2 and 3). Antibodyagainst DHFR was used to determine expression of the CyaA-DHFR-IDTS orendogenous DHFR. Densitometry of the CyaA-DHFR-IDTS bands allowedfor quantification of protein concentration for determining specific activity.(C) DHFR fusion proteins are enzymatically active. Bacterial cultures weregrown in the presence of IPTG to induce expression of the indicated proteinfusions. Cells were lysed, and the soluble protein extracts were combined with100 \ufffdM NADPH, 100 \ufffdM dihydrofolic acid, and either 50 \ufffdM TMP or MTXto inhibit endogenous bacterial DHFR activity or all DHFR activity, respec-tively. Purified human DHFR was used as a positive control. Activity wasnormalized to DHFR protein levels as determined by Western blotting. P val-ues are determined by Student\u2019s t test, comparing DHFR activity of fusions inthe presence of TMP to the purified human DHFR control.Amyot et al.3244 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgall reactions was abolished by MTX (Fig. 2C). The data are con-sistent with a folded protein moiety causing defective substratetranslocation.DHFR does not interfere with cyclase activity or increase ag-gregation of the chimeric proteins. One complication of usingCyaA fusions is that the assay is contingent on the enzymatic ac-tivity of the CyaA moiety being unaffected by the IDTS sequence.Therefore, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the pres-ence of DHFR inhibits adenylate cyclase activity. A modified, invitro version of the CyaA translocation assay was established toquantify the enzymatic activity of CyaA-DHFR-IDTS fusions rel-ative to the respective CyaA-IDTS. L. pneumophila cultures weregrown to late exponential phase, induced to express the CyaAconstructs, and lysed. The supernatants of the bacterial lysateswere incubated for 30 min in the presence of calmodulin and theadenylate cyclase substrate ATP, and the resulting cAMP produc-tion was measured via ELISA (see Materials and Methods). Nosignificant difference was observed in the CyaA activities of any ofthe protein fusions, regardless of DHFR, confirming that DHFR isnot inhibiting the activity of the marker enzyme (Fig. 4A). Similardata were seen when the incubation period was shortened to 5min, indicating that the longer reaction time did not overload thesystem (data not shown). Background levels of cAMP producedby L. pneumophila not expressing any CyaA fusion and a reactionmixture lacking calmodulin confirmed that adenylate cyclase ac-tivity was due to the B. pertussis CyaA. The culture supernatantfrom a strain that was not lysed also did not produce significantlevels of cAMP, consistent with previous research showing thatIcm/Dot secretion occurs only after contact with a host cell (58).These data are consistent with the DHFR moiety having no effecton cyclase activity, with the caveat that it is possible that aftertranslocation into host cells, the folding properties of the translo-cated substrate may differ significantly from that observed in bac-terial extracts.We next determined if DHFR hinders translocation by causingaggregation of the fusions. To compare aggregation of DHFR fu-sions and IDTS alone, we lysed cells and compared the relativeamounts of soluble and pelleted protein after high-speed centrif-ugation. The presence of substrate proteins in postcentrifugationfractions was visualized via immunoblots probed with anti-CyaA(Fig. 4B) (see Materials and Methods). The percentage of aggre-gation was determined as the amount of CyaA fusion protein thatprecipitated after high-speed centrifugation relative to the totalprotein retrieved, as quantified by densitometry of the immuno-blots. In all strains tested, no significant difference in aggregationwas seen between the IDTS fusions in the presence or absence ofDHFR, demonstrating that DHFR does not cause protein aggre-gation (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a majority of the protein remainedsoluble after centrifugation in the strains expressing RalF andMavU fusions, but in the strains expressing SidG fusions, nearly allprotein recovered from the high-speed centrifugation was seen inthe pellets. Although a relatively small amount of soluble SidGprotein appears to be available, our results show that SidG is stillreadily translocated. These results are consistent with the modelthat the DHFR moiety does not cause aggregation and that aggre-gation does not correlate with decreased translocation.Interference of IDTS translocation by ubiquitin requiresfolding of the interfering moiety. Although the data presentedargue that the DHFR moiety was folded and did not interfere withthe reporter readout, we could not analyze the consequences ofconditional folding of an interfering moiety. Therefore, we ana-lyzed ubiquitin (Ub) fusions to IDTSs as mutant Ub derivativesexist that are poorly folded, allowing us to compare folded andunfolded internal domains. As with DHFR, ubiquitin (Ub) is acompact, rapidly folding protein that can serve as a disruptivedomain for secreted substrates in multiple systems (43, 59, 60).Furthermore, simple mutations can be used to destabilize the pro-tein and yield an unfolded control for secretion assays (43, 59). Tothis end, we constructed a fusion of RalF tagged with CyaA to a Ubprotein in which two residues in the hydrophobic core (Ile3 andIle13) are replaced with Gly (UbG3,13) to destabilize the proteinconformation (Fig. 5A) (59).Interestingly, we found that the CyaA-RalF fusion to wild-typeUb was cleaved in the cytosol of L. pneumophila (Fig. 5B). Thismay be due to a deubiquitinating protease (DUB) that was pre-dicted bioinformatically to be encoded by L. pneumophila(Lpg2907; MavW) (13, 61). In contrast, the UbG3,13 protein wasnot cleaved, consistent with the interpretation that these muta-tions prevent folding of the Ub domain. As cleaved Ub fusionproteins would be uninformative in our experiments, we con-structed an additional Ub construct by replacing the terminal res-idue (Gly76) with a Val residue (UbV76). This mutation alters thesite of proteolytic cleavage by DUBs without perturbing the fold-ing of Ub (62).CyaA-RalF fused to the folded, uncleavable UbV76 demon-strated very low translocation efficiency (Fig. 5C), resulting incAMP levels similar to those of the dotA strain. In contrast, thefusion protein having the unfolded UbG3,13 derivative was trans-located at a small but significantly (P \ufffd 0.02) higher efficiencythan CyaA-RalF alone. Taking these results together with theDHFR data, we conclude that the extent to which an IDTS main-tains a region with a folded conformation inversely correlates withits translocation efficiency.The DHFR-MavU fusion protein exhibits a kinetic defect intranslocation. The above analysis shows that accumulation of thefusion proteins is lowered by the presence of a poison domain butdoes not investigate whether there is premature termination of secre-tion or whether the domain slows the rate of translocation. To carryout real-time, kinetic analysis of translocation to answer this ques-tion, we adapted the GloSensor cAMP assay (see Materials and Meth-ods). The system uses a modified Photinus pyralis luciferase that con-tains a cAMP-binding domain. Binding of cAMP causes aconformational change that allows the luciferase to interact with itssubstrate to produce light. For our purposes, monolayers of 293Tcells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the modifiedluciferase and the Fc\ufffdRIIA receptor (to facilitate uptake of IgG-op-sonized L. pneumophila) were preincubated with the luciferase sub-strate and then challenged with L. pneumophila strains harboringIDTSs fused to CyaA. Intracellular cAMP resulting from transloca-tion of the adenylate cyclase was monitored by the luminescent out-put over the course of the infection (see Materials and Methods). Thekinetic analysis agreed strongly with the endpoint cAMP assay.DHFR fusions to RalF and SidG, as well as the CyaA gene itself, re-sulted in a substantial kinetic delay in luminescence signal (decreasedrate of transfer as represented by depressed slope and increased time-to-half-maximal signal). (Fig. 6A and B). In each case, the time tohalf-maximal luminescence for the wild-type proteins fused to Cyawas approximately 5 min (Fig. 6A to C). In contrast, for the DHFRfusions to RalF and SidG, the time to half-maximal luminescence wasat least 30 min (Fig. 6A and B). The MavU-DHFR fusion, however,Substrate Determinants of Legionella Type IV SecretionSeptember 2013 Volume 81 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3245http://iai.asm.orgexhibited a more modest kinetic delay, with a time to half-maximalluminescence of approximately 18 min although the total accumula-tion of luminescence was clearly lower than that of the wild type(Fig. 6C). Similar results were obtained with the quantitative end-point CyaA translocation assay using individual time pointsover the course of infection (Fig. 6D). Both assays are consis-tent with an initial kinetic delay caused by DHFR fusion toMavU of about 15 to 20 min. This indicates that for at leastFIG 4 Translocation deficiency is not due to loss of adenylate cyclase activity or aggregation of fusion proteins. (A) Adenylate cyclase activity is unaffected byDHFR. Bacterial lysates were incubated in the presence of ATP and calmodulin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to allow for the production of cAMP. Samples were harvested andassayed as described in Materials and Methods. (B) Aggregation of IDTS protein fusions does not correlate with translocation defects of DHFR-IDTS fusions. L.pneumophila wild-type strains expressing the fusions were lysed, and cell debris was cleared by low-speed centrifugation. The resulting supernatant fraction was subjectedto centrifugation at 90,000 \ufffd g for 1 h to precipitate any aggregated protein. Supernatant and pellet fractions after centrifugation were analyzed by Western blotting withanti-CyaA and anti-ICDH antibody probes. D, low-speed pellet; T, low-speed supernatant; S, high-speed supernatant; P, high-speed pellet. (C) The intensity of the fusionproteins in panel B was determined by densitometry, and protein expression is graphed as a percentage of the total protein after high-speed centrifugation.Amyot et al.3246 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgsome IDTSs, a folded moiety within the protein interferes withthe efficiency of its passage through the Icm/Dot channel, low-ering the yields of translocated product due to depressed ratesof translocation and possibly delayed initiation of transit.Low-level translocation of DHFR-MavU requires IcmS. TheIcmS/W adaptor complex is necessary for translocation of a largesubset of L. pneumophila effectors (63, 64). Previous work indi-cated that the IcmS/W complex binds to several different IDTSs,and in the case of SidG, this appears to alter the conformationalstate of the protein (34). Furthermore, IcmS is necessary for thestability of the T4BSS coupling protein DotL and binds directly toDotL (32, 64). Therefore, if folded DHFR precludes IcmS frombinding the IDTS fusions, the folded moiety could restrict thesubstrate from forming a translocation-competent conformationwith IcmS/W.To investigate whether the presence of DHFR precludes IcmSfrom facilitating translocation, we first compared translocation ofDHFR-MavU in the wild type (Lp02) to an icmS deletion mutantof L. pneumophila. The translocation efficiency of DHFR-MavUwas more than 10-fold lower in the \ufffdicmS strain than in the wildtype, similar to the magnitude of defect found with the parentalMavU fusion (Fig. 7A). This indicates that the IcmS/IcmW com-plex is still necessary and capable of facilitating translocation ofthe DHFR fusion and is consistent with DHFR interfering withtranslocation at some level other than IcmS/W interactions.To further determine if DHFR prevented association of theIcmS/W complex with IDTSs, we determined the relative fractionof fusions that coassociate with the chaperone in the presence orabsence of the DHFR moiety (Fig. 7B). Either CyaA-MavU orCyaA-DHFR-MavU was coexpressed in E. coli with a GST-IcmS/IcmW complex (see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). Lysateswere incubated with immobilized glutathione resin, bound pro-teins were eluted with reduced glutathione, and CyaA-taggedproteins bound to GST-IcmS/IcmW were detected by immuno-blotting. There was no significant difference in binding to GST-IcmS/W between CyaA-MavU and CyaA-DHFR-MavU (Fig. 7B).In contrast, little fusion protein was associated with the resin inthe absence of coexpression of the GST-IcmS/W complex or ifGST alone was coexpressed with the fusions (Fig. 7B). We thusconfirm that the folded DHFR moiety does not interfere with theinteraction of IcmS/W with IDTSs.IDTS fused to folded DHFR or Ub interferes with Icm/Dotsecretion channel function. It is well documented that secretionsignals fused to secretion-incompetent proteins often result inblockage of the translocation channel, resulting in a severe atten-uation of channel function (36). Most relevant to this study, in-troduction of DHFR and Ub to type III secretion system-translo-cated substrates in Yersinia enterocolitica has been shown tointerfere with transport of other proteins through this channel(43, 65). As the DHFR and Ub fusions interfered with transloca-tion in the Icm/Dot T4SS, we tested whether these constructionscould occlude translocation of other IDTSs or slow the rate oftranslocation to the extent that there would be defective intracel-lular growth due to a blockage the Icm/Dot system, which isknown to be essential for intracellular growth.To determine if introducing a folded moiety into RalF causestranslocation inhibition, we monitored export of an endoge-nously expressed IDTS, SidC, in strains overproducing RalF fu-sions having either folded or unfolded domains inserted. U937cells were challenged for 1.5 h with L. pneumophila that expresseseither RalF or one of the RalF fusions (Fig. 8A and B), and cellswere lysed with digitonin. The detergent-soluble and -insolublefractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting to identify ex-ported and bacterium-associated SidC, respectively (55) (see Ma-terials and Methods). Strains expressing either the UbV76 orFIG 5 Folded ubiquitin inhibits translocation of fused Icm/Dot substrates.U937 cells were challenged with the wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 or atranslocation-defective dotA strain expressing CyaA-tagged RalF fused to ei-ther ubiquitin, a nonfolding variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13), or a variant thatcannot be cleaved by DUBs (UbV76).

Therefore,overproduction of the translocation-incompetent proteins inter-feres with function of the Icm/Dot translocon.To determine if interference with translocation also inhibitsintracellular bacterial replication, an intracellular growth assay ofL. pneumophila overexpressing RalF fused to DHFR, UbG3,13, orUbV76 was performed. Monolayers of bone marrow-derived mac-rophages from A/J mice were challenged with wild-type L. pneu-mophila expressing the reporter protein fusions for 14 h, which isapproximately one round of infection. Cells were fixed, and thenumber of bacteria in individual Legionella-containing vacuoles(LCVs) was determined by microscopy. In strains harboring RalFalone or RalF fused to the unfolded UbG3,13 variant, approxi-mately 60% of LCVs were large vacuoles with 11 or more bacteria,consistent with efficient growth in the presence of these proteins.In the strain expressing the DHFR fusion, the presence of DHFRrestricted growth, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage ofvacuoles that had small numbers of bacteria (1\u20133), with a corre-sponding decrease in vacuoles having more than 11 bacteria (Fig.8C). The growth defect was most pronounced in the strain ex-pressing the folded ubiquitin (UbV76), with the percentage of largevacuoles of 11 or more bacteria decreasing approximately 4-foldcompared to the strain expressing the unfolded Ub fusion (Fig.8C). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the percent-age of small and medium-sized vacuoles, consistent with de-creased growth in the presence of this fusion. This phenotype isindicative of a partial blockage of the translocon by folded pro-teins, reducing the rate of translocation of IDTSs needed for bac-terial replication. Therefore, occlusion of the channel by the in-troduction of a folded domain interferes with the ability of L.pneumophila to grow intracellularly.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that translocation of substrates of the Icm/Dot T4SS into host cells is depressed by the presence of moietiesthat assume folded conformations. Fusion proteins of DHFR andUb to IDTSs demonstrate a defect in translocation compared totheir unfolded counterparts (Fig. 1 and 5). Furthermore, there wasa small but significant increase in translocation of the IDTS RalFfused to a destabilized variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13) relative toRalF alone, consistent with an unfolded region stimulating trans-location (Fig. 5). If the unstructured moiety increases the amountof unfolding of the entire IDTS, translocation competence may bedefined by the ability of the IDTS to maintain an unfolded con-formation.Many IDTSs are translated prior to infection, as indicated bythe fact that protein synthesis inhibitors do not affect transloca-tion rates (58). If we consider this in context with our data, theFIG 6 The DHFR-IDTS fusion proteins exhibit kinetic defects in transloca-tion. Results of real-time translocation assays of CyaA and Cya-DHFR moi-eties fused to IDTS RalF (A), SidG (B), and MavU (C) are shown.

RLU, relative light units.Amyot et al.3248 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgsystem would likely require one or more chaperone proteins toperpetuate an unfolded, translocation-competent state of the ef-fectors. These may be heat shock proteins or uncharacterizedchaperones but also could include the adapter protein complexesof IcmS/W and IcmS/LvgA (64). These small proteins are hypoth-esized to resemble the type III secretion system chaperones whichact to hold proteins in a partially unfolded conformation for de-livery to the translocon ATPase for subsequent unfolding and se-cretion (45, 46, 66). Consistent with a role for these proteins form-ing a pretranslocation complex, IcmS/W can associate withFIG 7 DHFR does not preclude interaction of the IcmS adapter protein withthe IDTS protein fusions.

The INand E lanes from each sample were analyzed on a single blot but were loaded onnoncontiguous lanes, as noted by gaps between lanes.FIG 8 Folded protein fusions cause a partial blockage of the Icm/Dot translocon.(A) Translocation of SidC is decreased in strains harboring folded fusions. Secre-tion of IDTSs in strains overexpressing folded protein fusions was visualized bydetergent fractionation of infected cells (see Materials and Methods). U937 cellswere challenged with Legionella expressing CyaA-RalF fusions to DHFR, a foldedUb (UbV76), or the unfolded Ub (UbG3,13). After 1.5 h, cells were washed and lysedwith 0.5% digitonin, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated bycentrifugation. Translocation of the IDTS SidC into the cytoplasm of infected cells(digitonin-soluble extract) was analyzed by probing via immunoblotting. Anti-bodies to the bacterial T4SS protein DotF and the cytoplasmic protein RhoGDIwere used to confirm that lysis does not release bacterial proteins as well as to showseparation of the fractions. L.p., L. pneumophila. (B) The graph depicts the per-centage of the SidC protein translocated, considered as the amount in the solublefraction relative to the total protein in the sample, as determined by densitometry.The experiment was performed twice. Shown is a representative experiment. (C)Intracellular growth of strains harboring folded fusion proteins is inhibited. Mu-rine bone marrow macrophages were challenged with either the wild-type strain(Lp02) or dotA strains harboring RalF fusions containing DHFR, a folded Ub(UbV76), or the unfolded Ub (UbG3,13). Growth was allowed to proceed for 14 h, atwhich time the infected macrophages were fixed and stained with an antibodyagainst Legionella. The number of intracellular bacteria in individual vacuoles wasdetermined for 100 cells each on three individual replicates for each sample. Dataindicate the percentage of vacuoles with 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 10, and 11 or morebacteria per vacuole \r standard error.Substrate Determinants of Legionella Type IV SecretionSeptember 2013 Volume 81 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3249http://iai.asm.orgtranslocated substrates only when coexpressed in cells (34). Thispretranslocation complex appears to be the form that is presentedto the secretion channel as IcmS binds directly to DotL, the secre-tion ATPase in the Icm/Dot system (32). Although insertion ofDHFR interfered with translocation, IcmS/W was still able to in-teract with MavU- and SidG-DHFR fusions, and IcmS was neces-sary to facilitate the translocation of the DHFR-MavU fusion (Fig.7). These results indicate that the defect in translocation observedin this work is independent of IcmS/W action.Using two different assays, we were able to demonstrate thatthe DHFR moiety decreases the rate of protein transport (Fig. 6).Two models can explain this result. The first possibility is that afolded domain does not cause an absolute block in translocation,either because the Icm/Dot system has some intrinsic ability totranslocate folded proteins or because the secretion system is ableto convert translocation-incompetent substrates into transferra-ble conformations. The second possibility is that there is a smallsubpopulation of proteins that are partially unfolded. In eithermodel, the extent to which a protein is in a translocation-compe-tent conformation directly correlates with the rate that it can betransported through the Icm/Dot translocon.In addition to the translocation defect of a tightly folded pro-tein, the effector fusions interfere with translocation of otherIDTSs (Fig. 8), consistent with at least partial occlusion of thetranslocon. In the case of the Yersinia T3SS, the presence of foldeddomains in translocated substrates interferes with the assembly ofspecific components necessary for the function of the translocon(65). Although we cannot exclude this possibility, the fact that theDHFR fusions are very poorly translocated but cause only partialinterference with intracellular growth (Fig. 8) is consistent withthe Icm/Dot complex being largely intact. We propose two modelsfor the mechanism of this blockage. First, the interfering proteinfusion could disrupt transport of only a subset of translocatedeffectors that are critical for intracellular growth. The secondmodel is that the fusion protein is stalled within the secretionchannel, causing a global decrease in the rate of all IDTSs. The lowrate of transport of the fusion proteins could generate a situationakin to a traffic jam, in which a group of slow-moving individualscauses a general reduction in the rate of movement of all individ-uals moving through the secretion channel.If stalled or slow-moving substrates cause the generalizedtranslocation defect, then there must be some explanation for whysuch interference occurs. Although the structure of the T4BSS hasnot been fully elucidated, cryo-electron microscopic and crystalstructures of core components of a T4SS from plasmid pKM101have been solved. While the Icm/Dot system constitutes a differ-ent class of secretion apparatus (T4BSS), some insight can begained from considering the known structure. Cryo-electron mi-croscopy of the T4SS reveals a unique structure in which the coreforms a large, bulbous chamber between the inner and outermembranes (47). Importantly, the channel is constricted at thecapped outer membrane face, which the crystal structure suggestsundergoes a conformational change that could restrict the chan-nel at the outer membrane, allowing opening or closing of thesecretion pore (30, 47). At the base of the structure is a largeentryway of 55 nm although it is believed that other componentsof the secretion system could fit within this entryway and make fora much narrower passage site (47). Based upon this configuration,at the very least, the transport of folded proteins through the Icm/Dot system may be hindered while exiting the translocon. Thissituation would likely lead to the accumulation of proteins withinthe secretion system core.Blocks could also occur at the entry site of the secretion com-plex. In this scenario, initiation of movement into the secretioncomplex would result in a frustrated intermediate in which there isa physical block at the entrance. Furthermore, occlusion of IDTSscould occur at a step that is prior to entry into the complex. In theT3SS, folded effector fusions prevent translocation of other IDTSsby binding to and inhibiting the ATPase associated with the secre-tion system (65). Normally, chaperones carry their cognate sub-strates to the T3SS in a partially unfolded conformation, thus\u201cpriming\u201d them for complete unfolding by the ATPase beforetranslocation (45, 46). In the Icm/Dot system it has been proposedthat DotL, as part of a subcomplex with the ATPases DotM andDotN, acts as a regulator of IDTS entry (67). DotL has sequencesimilarity to type IV secretion system coupling proteins, which areproposed to link substrates to the rest of the secretion complex(68). The fact that DotL associates with IcmS could be key tolinking the substrate to the secretion system. Folded proteins maybe blocked from entry by an inappropriate interaction with DotL,thus inhibiting further translocation of effectors.These studies demonstrate that small folded domains can gen-erate impassable substrates through the L. pneumophila T4SS,consistent with a strong selection against such moieties beingpresent in IDTSs. Therefore, it would appear that most IDTSs areeither easily unfolded, maintained with chaperones in an unfoldedconformation, or have determinants that allow recognition by un-foldases associated with the Icm/Dot complex. Future work willrequire identifying the features of the substrates that allow them tobe secretion competent and determining which bacterial proteinscontribute to generating structures that maintain this conforma-tion.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSR.R.I. is an investigator of HHMI, while W.M.A. and D.D. were supportedby NIH training grant T32AI00742.
