Here we show that ERK-mediated reactivation is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase (MSK) family. Furthermore, this MSKmediated response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). Specifically, CREBbinding to the MIEP provides the target for MSK recruitment. Importantly, MSK mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 isrequired to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these datasuggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate thechromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Thus the importance of CREB during HCMV reactivation is topromote chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor.Clearly, specific inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.Citation: Kew VG, Yuan J, Meier J, Reeves MB (2014) Mitogen and Stress Activated Kinases Act Co-operatively with CREB during the Induction of HumanCytomegalovirus Immediate-Early Gene Expression from Latency.

The prototype betaherpesvirus member, HumanCytomegalovirus (HCMV) is no exception, establishing a latentreservoir in the haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow (reviewedin [1]). It is likely that sporadic reactivation and shedding \u2013although subclinical \u2013 is important for the sero-prevalence ofHCMV in the population via horizontal transmission. However, itis the reactivation of HCMV (as well as primary infection) inimmune-compromised transplant recipients or late-stage AIDSsufferers that represent a significant source of morbidity andmortality in these high risk patient populations [2,3,4]. Conse-quently, an understanding of the molecular and physiological cuesthat promote reactivation could inform on the design of noveltherapeutic strategies.Studies from a number of laboratories using analyses ofexperimental and natural latency have led to a consensus thatHCMV establishes latency in the haematopoietic cells of the bonemarrow [5,6,7,8,9], persists in the monocyte/myeloid lineage[10,11,12] and reactivates upon the differentiation and/orstimulation of these cells to a more mature or activated phenotype[8,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Furthermore, these reactivation eventsappear to be augmented by inflammatory cytokine signalling(e.g. TNF, interferon-gamma) acting in concert with cellulardifferentiation [13,16,18]. Indeed we, and others, have reportedthat the incubation of latently infected myeloid cells with IL-6 canbe a trigger for HCMV reactivation in experimental latency[13,17]. Furthermore, we have also observed that the reactivationof naturally latent virus from the dendritic cells (DCs) of healthyindividuals can be markedly abrogated using neutralising IL-6antibodies [13,16]. Although we have postulated a role for ERK-MAPK and interleukin-6 signalling in this event the underlyingmechanisms are still unclear [13].In concert with observations in primary cells, studies of thequiescent infection of the embryonal T2 carcinoma cell line havesuggested that elevated cAMP signalling promotes reactivation in acreb response element (CRE) dependent manner [19,20]. Thisalleviation of quiescent infection can be achieved using bothchemical (forskolin) and biological (vasoactive intestinal peptide)activity and is suggestive that regions of the major immediate earlypromoter (MIEP) shown to be redundant during lytic infectionmay have important functions during reactivation from latency inresponse to these stimuli [19,20,21]. In contrast, transfectionexperiments with the MIEP point towards a role for TNF-a anddownstream NF-KB signalling during reactivation [22] and,indeed, murine CMV (MCMV) studies support an important rolePLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195&domain=pdffor these signalling pathways also [23,24,25]. Furthermore, thereactivation of HCMV from experimentally latent cell lines hasalso been reported using phorbol esters and TNF-a - againconsistent with a role for aspects of NF-Kb signalling beinginvolved in HCMV reactivation [26,27] by triggering IE geneexpression.ERK MAPK signalling can be activated by a diverse number ofligands acting through two upstream modulators. Classical Ras-Raf mediated ERK-MAPK signalling often acts in response tomitogenic stimulation [28] with aberrant signalling associated witha transformed phenotype in oncogenic cells [29]. Alternatively,signalling can be activated by tpl2/Cot1 [30] which targetsdownstream ERK phosphorylation following the engagement ofToll-like [31] and receptors in the TNF super-family [32]. ERKphosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation and subsequentphosphorylation of a number of target proteins [33]. These targetsinclude the mitogen and stress activated protein kinases (MSKs)and 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSKs) [34,35,36] whichthemselves target a number of cellular substrates [35,37].Interestingly, these targets include transcription factors and histoneproteins that may have roles in the regulation of HCMVimmediate early gene expression [15,19,20,38,39,40].In this study, we have sought to address the mechanisms thatare important for the induction of IE gene expression required toinitiate HCMV reactivation. We have focussed on the interplaybetween cellular signalling pathways and the activation of targettranscription factors. Building on our previous studies looking atERK-MAPK signalling we have addressed the impact of CREBbinding to the MIEP and how it asks as a platform to integratecellular signalling at the MIEP in differentiating DCs capable ofsupporting reactivation. Using interleukin-6 or LPS as a tool toinitiate HCMV reactivation, we have identified that phosphory-lated CREB occupancy on the MIEP is important for theinduction of IE gene expression. Furthermore, we also show thathistone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 correlates with inductionof IE gene expression. Interestingly, the activation of the upstreamMSKs is pivotal for reactivation - with CREB and Histone H3being major targets for this kinase which is also recruited to theMIEP prior to the induction of IE gene expression. Intriguingly,we also observe that histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP isdefective in the DCRE virus suggesting that binding andphosphorylation of CREB by MSKs promotes the subsequentphosphorylation of histone H3. Finally, we show that abrogationof ERK-MAPK signalling using a dominant negative form ofMEK1, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, diminishes MSKactivation and blocks CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation atthe MIEP resulting in a substantial defect in IE gene expression.Since histone H3 phosphorylation is a key event in the transitionfrom a repressed (latent) to an active (reactivated) promoter thesedata suggest that CREB is an important factor for reactivation notonly because of its classical role as a transcriptional activator butalso via co-operative interaction with MSK to drive elevatedhistone phosphorylation at the MIEP and subsequent activation ofgene expression.ResultsIE gene expression from latent virus is promoted throughRas-Raf mediated ERK-MAPK signallingOngoing studies of the pathways important for HCMVreactivation from DCs have highlighted the ERK-MAPK pathwayas an important factor [13]. The maturation of DCs in response toLPS triggers ERK phosphorylation which could occur via at leasttwo potential pathways \u2013 tpl2/Cot1 or Ras-Raf. To test whichpathway was important in the context of LPS induced reactiva-tion, latently infected monocytes were differentiated to immatureDCs and then, prior to stimulation with LPS, incubated with a panERK-MAPK inhibitor or specific inhibitors of the tpl2 and Ras-Raf pathways. A qRT-PCR analysis for IE gene expressionconfirmed our previous data that ERK-MAPK inhibition blockedinduction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1A,B). However,inhibition with the upstream targets suggested that it was Ras-Raf,and not tpl2 signalling, which was important for triggering theinduction of IE RNA expression (Fig. 1A,B). Previously, we haveobserved that a major component of HCMV reactivation uponDC stimulation with LPS is IL-6 and that activation of ERK-MAPK signalling was also important in this response. Again,consistent with a major role for Ras-Raf it was only inhibition ofthis effector molecule \u2013 and not tpl2 signalling \u2013 which had amajor impact on HCMV IE RNA reactivation in response to IL-6(Fig. 1B). Crucially, this defect in RNA expression was alsoobserved at the protein level. Pre-incubation of immature DCswith inhibitors prior to stimulation with LPS or IL-6 resulted in amarked defect in the number of IE-expressing cells in ERK, Ras-Raf but not tpl2 inhibitor treated cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, theobservation that LPS induced gene expression is dependent onRas signalling is consistent with LPS inducing reactivation via anindirect mechanism (IL-6; Ras-ERK signalling) rather than adirect mechanism (tpl2-ERK signalling).CREB binding and phosphorylation to the MIEP isimportant for the induction of IE gene expression inprimary DCsStudies with the laboratory strain, Towne, using a quiescentinfection model in T2 cells have suggested that the CREBresponse elements in the MIEP could have an important role inreactivation in response to mitogenic stimuli [20] and thus wehypothesised that differential binding to the MIEP of CREB couldbe a potential mechanism in primary DCs. To address this, a seriesof experiments were performed in reactivating CD14+ derivedDCs. (Fig. 2). Firstly we examined CREB binding to the MIEP.Interestingly, the co-immunoprecipitation of the MIEP withCREB was observed in both CD14+ monocytes as well asdifferentiated DCs although increased levels of specific CREBbinding was detected as the cells became more differentiated whencompared to the isotype matched control (Fig. 2A). However,despite the inhibitory effect (Fig. 1), pre-treatment with an ERK-MAPK had no impact on the binding of CREB to the MIEPAuthor SummaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of immune-compromised individuals is a significant cause of morbid-ity. In a number of settings disease is caused by thereactivation of a pre-existing quiescent infection of thehost (latency) which, in the absence of a controllingimmune response, is a major source of disease. Work tounderstand the switch from a latent to active (reactivated)infection has focussed on the regulation of the promoterthat controls the major viral gene products IE72 and IE86 \u2013an important first step towards HCMV reactivation. In thisstudy we have correlated the activation of cellularsignalling pathways with the downstream activation ofthis promoter. Specifically, the activation of cellular kinasein an ERK-MAPK dependent manner which displays anaffinity for a protein bound to a key viral promoter drives achange in the chromatin architecture that allows viral geneexpression \u2013 releasing the virus from the latent state.MSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus ReactivationPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195(Fig. 2A) suggesting that CREB binding to the MIEP was notinhibited by ERK. However, a second analysis that assayedrelative levels of CREB and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB)bound to the MIEP suggested that the levels of CREBphosphorylation most strongly correlated with induced IE geneexpression \u2013 and the effects of chemical inhibitors. In CD14+monocytes, minimal binding of p-CREB to the MIEP wasobserved. In contrast, in reactivating cells the predominant formwas p-CREB except when the cells were pre-incubated with anERK-MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2B) at a concentration known to blockinduction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1). Furthermore,Western blot analysis suggested that these effects were not due to aglobal inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in the cell by the ERKinhibitor (Fig. 2C) consistent with multiple pathways capable ofpromoting phosphorylation of the total cellular pool of CREB.Taken together these data suggested that whilst inhibition of ERK-MAPK signalling had little impact on CREB binding to the MIEPit did result a marked reduction in the detection of p-CREB boundto the MIEP correlating with a defect in the levels of viral IE geneexpression.The CRE elements in the MIEP of HCMV promote efficientIE gene expression upon exit from latencyThe prediction therefore would be that deletion of the CREwithin the MIEP would impact on HCMV reactivation from DCs.To test this, 19 bp repeat deletions were generated in theendothelial-tropic strain, TB40/e as described previously forTowne [21]. Firstly, we confirmed that CREB did not bind to theMIEP of the DCRE virus (Fig. S1). Then these viruses were usedto establish a latent infection in CD14+ monocytes as evidenced bylong term UL138 gene expression in an absence of UL123expression. Unsurprisingly, there appeared to be no overt defect inthe ability of the mutant virus to establish a latent infection norany differential ability to carry HCMV genomes from monocytesto immature DCs (Fig. 3A,B). However, when the cells weredifferentiated and then subsequently stimulated with LPS or IL-6 adefect in the ability of the DCRE mutant virus re-initiate IE geneexpression was observed (Fig. 3C) \u2013 an effect more profound whenIL-6 stimulation was used (Fig. 3C). These data directly correlatedwith a ChIP analysis for the presence of histone 3 dimethylated atlysine 4 (H3-K42me) at the MIEP which, indicative of activetranscription from a promoter, was more abundant on the wild typeand revertant MIEPs compared with the DCRE (Fig. 3D). The defectin MIEP activity during reactivation appeared to be specific for thisphase of infection as the initiation of lytic infections in both HFFs andFigure 1.

In contrast to our observations with the DCRE virus, a deletionof the NF-KB binding sites from the MIEP appeared to have littleimpact on the induction of IE gene expression in primary DCs inresponse to IL-6 (Fig. S3). Thus, under these experimental conditions,the CRE sites in the MIEP were important for the induction of IEgene expression upon exit from latency.Inhibition of mitogen and stress activated protein kinaseactivity blocks induction of HCMV gene expressionTaken together these data suggested that ERK-MAPK signal-ling initiated by mitogenic stimuli (i.e. IL-6) promoted HCMVreactivation in a Ras-Raf dependent manner and that CREB, adownstream target of ERK, was important for this. Thus our nextFigure 2. The binding of phosphorylated CREB to the MIEP correlates with reactivation.

Pre-incubation ofimmature DCs with an MSK inhibitor significantly abrogated IL-6 induced IE gene expression in reactivating DCs (Fig. 4A).Interestingly, this effect was more profound than observed with anERK-MAPK inhibitor (possibly due to the incomplete inhibitionof MSK phosphorylation seen with the ERK-MAPK inhibitor(Fig. 4B)). Furthermore, the effect was specific for the MSK familyas no effect was observed with an RSK inhibitor (Fig. 4A).Furthermore, the effects appeared to be specific to latency.Primary infection of DCs in the presence or absence of MSK orRSK inhibitors had little impact on IE gene expression whenmeasured by IE-RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) or by indirect immuno-fluorescent staining for IE protein expression (Fig. 4D).Figure 3. Deletion of the creb response elements from the MIEP abrogates reactivation in DCs.

As such, we remainedintrigued by the observation that MSK inhibitors had such adramatic impact on HCMV IE gene expression in DCs (Fig. 4)and thus we reasoned it was an essential integration point fordefining the ERK triggered response. Indeed, unlike ERK-MAPK, the inhibition of MSK activity profoundly blocks IL-6induced CREB phosphorylation in DCs (Fig. 5A) whilst,unsurprisingly, having little impact on the phosphorylation ofERK and MSK themselves (Fig. 5A). Although we cannot rule outan effect of H-89 on Protein Kinase A activity \u2013 itself a protein thatcan phosphorylate CREB \u2013 the rapid induction of MSKphosphorylation by IL-6 which signals in a PKA independentmanner [42,43].Consequently, we hypothesised that other targets of MSK mayalso be important for inducing IE gene expression from latency.An attractive candidate was histone H3. Predominantly methyl-ated when bound to the MIEP in latency, reactivation in DCs isconcomitant with global acetylation of histones bound to theMIEP [15]. Clearly signalling pathways dictate this phenotypicswitch and we focussed on the ability of MSK to promote histoneH3 phosphorylation at serine residue 10 [44] \u2013 an event which hasbeen hypothesised to provide a critical intermediary step betweenhistone de-methylation and subsequent histone acetylation onmultiple \u2018early response\u2019 cellular promoters [45,46].A time of addition study, analysing the ability of neutralising IL-6 antibodies to block HCMV reactivation following stimulationwith LPS, revealed that the effects of IL-6 signalling must manifestat immediate-early times post infection (Fig. S4). Consequently, weperformed an initial time-course analysis revealed that histonephosphorylation at serine-10 occurred rapidly with phosphoryla-tion detectable within 1 hour post stimulation (Fig. S5). Consistentwith a role for ERK-MAPK activation in reactivation we alsoobserved that histone phosphorylation and acetylation wasobserved in IE-expressing DCs and that this phenotype wasinhibited by ERK-MAPK or Raf inhibitors (Fig. S6). Further-more, the phosphorylation of histone H3 in response to IL-6 didnot require de novo viral (or cellular) gene expression (Fig. S7)suggesting it occurred prior to HCMV lytic gene expression andthus reactivation. More pertinently, the pre-incubation of imma-ture DCs with MSK inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease inthe detection of the phosphorylated forms of both histone H3 andCREB bound to the MIEP (Fig. 5B). In contrast, use of an RSKinhibitor appeared to have no impact (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, therelatively higher levels of H3-K9 methylation at the MIEP inMSK inhibitor treated cells supports the hypothesis that MSKactivity is required for a switch in the chromatin phenotype from arepressed to active state at the MIEP.Finally, we examined reactivating cells for the presence of MSKat the MIEP. A time-course analysis showed that MSK immune-precipitated with the MIEP but, unlike observed with histone H3phosphorylation (Fig. S5), the occupancy appeared far moretransient (Fig. 5C) which is likely reflected in the differentfunctional roles these proteins play. Both histones and CREBare likely associated with the MIEP for longer duration whereasMSK recruitment and activity is likely a more acute response tosignalling. Once the targets are phosphorylated MSK may bereleased from the complex.The phosphorylation of CREB bound to the MIEPpromotes histone H3 phosphorylationOur data suggested that for the successful initiation of HCMVreactivation to occur phosphorylation of both CREB and histoneH3 were necessary. Thus, we reasoned that ChIP analyses ofreactivating cells generated from either wild type or DCREinfected monocytes could still be bound by phosphorylatedhistones and the defect in the DCRE virus possibly due to a lackof CREB binding. However, we were intrigued to observe that anovert lack of phosphorylated histone H3 bound to the MIEP of theDCRE infected cells was observed upon stimulation with IL-6(Fig. 6A). This suggested that histone H3 phosphorylation at theMIEP was dependent on CREB binding. Consequently, weperformed a ChIP re-ChIP analysis on reactivating cells todetermine whether the binding of phosphorylated CREB wasindeed co-incident with histone H3 phosphorylation. To do thiswe performed a ChIP analysis on IL-6 treated DCs 2 hours poststimulation or unstimulated DCs with anti-H3-S10p, anti-H3-K93Meand the appropriate isotype matched control. As expected,the analysis of the first round IP showed that the MIEPs in thestimulated DCs were predominantly associated with phosphory-lated and not methylated histones whereas as in the unstimulatedDCs the MIEP was predominantly associated with methylatedhistones (Fig. 6B) consistent with the IE gene expression profile inthese different cell populations. We then focussed on thereactivating samples to determine whether CREB was concom-itantly bound with H3-S10P. Consistent with our hypothesis, wecould detect the IP of the MIEP following incubation with the p-CREB antibody. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the GAPDHpromoter (the regulation of which is CREB-independent [47])showed that this promoter was not enriched in the sample (Fig. 6C)nor did we detect any MIEP sequences in a p-CREB IP from theH3-K93Meprimary IP sample. Taken together, these data suggestthat phosphorylated CREB and histone H3-S10Pwere concom-itantly bound to the MIEP in IE expressing DC populations.Finally, the data and the model predicted that MSK recruit-ment to the MIEP would also be on the same promotersharbouring phosphorylated histones. Thus we performed thesame ChIP re-ChIP procedure to assess MSK binding. Ouranalysis, performed at 2 hpi (when both MSK and H3-S10-P canbe detected on the MIEP (Figs. 5 and S5)) showed that we couldobserve enrichment for MSK binding to the MIEP also bound byH3-S10-P (Fig. 6D). Thus, MSK, CREB and H3-S10 phosphor-ylation could be detected on the same MIEPs in reactivating cells.Figure 5.

We reasoned that theinefficient transfection of primary DCs with siRNAs would notallow us to see effects on HCMV when between 3\u20135% of cells areactively supporting HCMV latency based on IE positivity uponIL-6 stimulation. Therefore, we infected differentiating monocytes4 days post differentiation with adenoviruses expressing GFP or adominant negative form of ERK kinase MEK1 (Figure 7).Importantly, using adenoviruses we could establish between 60\u201370% infection based on the expression of GFP when the cells wereanalysed 24 hours post infection. Consistent with the expression ofa dominant negative form MEK1, ERK and downstreamphosphorylation of MSK was substantially reduced (Fig. 7A) \u2013giving us further confidence that CREB phosphorylation inresponse to IL-6 was MSK and not PKA dependent (Fig. 5).Importantly, no effect on STAT-3 phosphorylation was observedin response to IL-6 confirming that there was not a globalinhibition of IL-6 signalling (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we analysedDCs 48 hours post infection with the adenoviruses for HCMVgene expression. Interestingly, expression of MEK1 had aprofound impact on the level of IE gene expression in DCs(Fig. 7B). Pertinently, the expression of inactive MEK1 alsoimpacted on CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP(Fig. 7C). The normal phosphorylation of CREB and histone H3,and concomitant loss of histone methylation, was severelyabrogated (Fig. 7C).Activation of histone H3 phosphorylation induces IEgene expression in dendritic cells independent of CREBThe data thus far argue that MSK-mediated phosphorylation ofCREB and histone H3 correlated with an induction of IE geneexpression. We hypothesized that one explanation for the majorrole of CREB during reactivation is to enhance histone H3phosphorylation which would promote gene expression via theadoption of an open chromatin conformation. We reasoned,therefore, that a surrogate signal for histone phosphorylation maybe sufficient to trigger HCMV IE gene expression in the DCREvirus. Histone phosphorylation is dynamically regulated and,consequently, the inhibition of the histone dephosphorylaseprotein phosphatase 2A promotes hyper-phosphorylation ofhistones at a number of cellular promoters. Interestingly,incubation of immature DCs derived from latently infectedmonocytes with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acidwas sufficient to drive induction of IE gene expression of both wildtype and, albeit less efficiently, the DCRE virus (Fig. 8A). Althoughwe cannot rule out off-target effects associated with the use ofokadaic acid, the well established effects of okadaic acid on histonephosphorylation was consistent with elevated levels of phosphor-ylated histones bound to the MIEP were observed by ChIP assaycorrelating with the detection of HCMV gene expression (Fig. 8B)suggesting that chemical insults, similar to those proposed with theuse of histone deacetylase inhibitors, triggered IE gene expressionfrom quiescent virus. However, we note that unlike observed withHDAC inhibitors, okadaic acid did not trigger IE gene expressionin monocytes under the same experimental conditions suggestingthat cellular differentiation was also important.DiscussionUnderstanding the cellular and molecular basis of HCMVreactivation remains an enigmatic problem. Numerous studies ofboth HCMV and murine CMV have shown that inflammation is akey component of CMV reactivation [8,13,17,18,22,24,25] byinducing or augmenting the expression of the IE genes from apreviously quiescent state. An understanding of the role ofinflammation and, specifically, the signalling components activat-ed by it, will be pivotal for delineation of the molecular basis ofHCMV reactivation which, subsequently, impacts on the design offuture therapeutic targets to control HCMV disease. Ultimately, ablockade \u2013 or at least a diminishment of the induction of IE geneexpression will prevent efficient HCMV reactivation.Pivotal early events in the reactivation of HCMV includecellular differentiation and concomitant activation of transcriptionof the major IE genes [1]. Indeed, we argue that cellulardifferentiation is a key event for the effects we observe. In ourmodel for the induction of HCMV IE gene expression fromlatency we hypothesise that MSK activity via CREB is importantfor the first stages of HCMV reactivation in IL-6 stimulatedimmature DCs. Importantly, we also observe that IL-6 does notdirectly trigger HCMV reactivation from monocytes [13] and thusthe MIEP in monocytes is intrinsically unresponsive to IL-6 (Fig. 9).This suggests that cellular differentiation, or even long termculture of monocytes [17], either eliminates an intrinsic block toIL-6 mediated activation of the MIEP or, alternatively, up-regulates a co-factor that helps drive the induction of HCMV geneexpression from latency.Robust IE gene expression can be triggered by IL-6 or LPS inthis system and, previously, a number of different cytokines havebeen implicated in the initiation of HCMV and MCMV IEreactivation [8,17,18,24,25]. These include interferon gamma andTNF, interleukin-1b, or GM-CSF and IL-4 and thus cytokinesimportant for myeloid cell differentiation and inflammation alsopromote and propagate CMV reactivation. Indeed, it is importantto re-iterate that we argue that IL-6 induces robust reactivation ofHCMV from immature DCs in our hands rather than acting as a\u2018latency breaker\u2019 \u2013 in that it cannot reverse latency in primitiveprogenitor cells. Consistent with this, low level reactivation isFigure 6. Phosphorylation of histone H3 is dependent on CREB binding to the MIEP. A) Immature DCs (iDC) derived from monocytesinfected with wild type (WT), Revertant (Rev) or CRE deletion virus (DCRE) were left un-stimulated (1,3,5) or IL-6 treated cells (2,4,6).

We reason that this couldexplain why neutralising IL-6 antibodies significantly reduce the levelof HCMV reactivation we observe but do not abolish it completely.It is highly plausible that there is not one molecular pathwaythat is responsible for acting as a latency breaker and that actuallythe notion of a single \u2018latency breaker\u2019 is fundamentally flawed.The composition of the MIEP should, theoretically, make itresponsive to diverse stimuli. A number of motifs render itresponsive to activators of NF-KB, CREB, AP-1 and IFN activatedpathways suggesting that redundancy (or co-operativity) existsFigure 7. A dominant negative MEK1 blocks IE gene expression and CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP.

Consistent with redundancy, the deletion of anumber of these elements does not significantly impact on thegrowth of HCMV mutants in fibroblasts in vitro [21]. In contrast,consistent with a degree of co-operativity, it has been reported thatCREs located in the proximal enhancer region may be importantfor co-ordinating efficient transcription factor activity at the MIEPFigure 8. Okadaic acid promotes histone phosphorylation at the MIEP and partially rescuing the CRE deletion virus.

As such, it has been postulatedthat these regions could be important in a cell type or contextspecific manner [20,50]. In this study, we asked whetherpreviously identified CRE elements were important for HCMVreactivation in primary cells. Based on these observations thereactivation of the DCRE virus was less efficient than wild type.This defect in reactivation correlated with a failure to promote themodification of histones from a latent (H3-K93me) to an active(H3-K42me) upon reactivation. Key to this switch was the activityof MSKs which promote extensive histone H3 phosphorylation atthe MIEP in the early stages of reactivation. The idea of CREB/MSK-mediated phosphorylation of the histones bound to theMIEP as an important trigger of reactivation is highly attractive.Firstly, previous work has shown histone phosphorylation at serine10 can synergise with histone acetylation [51] as well as de-stabilising the binding of chromo-domain proteins such asheterochromatin protein 1 [52,53] \u2013 a protein that is recruitedto methylated histones bound to promoters including the viralMIEP during latency [15]. Furthermore, histone phosphorylationis associated with a distinct set of promoters (the so-called \u2018rapidresponse genes\u2019) argued to promote hyper-acetylation of histonesat these loci in a MAPK and MSK dependent manner [53].Clearly, these events would positively influence HCMV reactiva-tion if the MIEP is subject to the same mechanisms of regulation.Indeed, in vitro biochemical studies on the c-fos promoter haveshown that the chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is highlyresistant to MSK mediated phosphorylation [54]. However, thebinding of CREB (itself a target for MSK kinase activity) acts topromote histone phosphorylation and, as such, the parallels withour cell based analyses of HCMV latency and reactivation arestriking. Furthermore, it is intriguing that this response at the c-fospromoter was enhanced by the presence of HMG (high mobilitygroup) proteins [54] \u2013 a family of chromatin bound proteinsimplicated in the regulation of RTA mediated regulation ofgamma herpes virus gene expression [55,56] \u2013 includingreactivation from latency. As such, it is tempting to speculate thatMSK could play a role in the reactivation of multiple herpes viruses.Initially it was slightly surprising that MSK but not RSK activitycontributed to the reactivation. RSK activity is predominantlyassociated with ERK-MAPK signalling whereas MSKs areactivated via both ERK and p38 mediated mechanisms yet itappears ERK activation is important for HCMV reactivation [13].However, the role of ERK-MAPK signalling via MSKs inresponse to pro-inflammatory cytokine and growth factor stimu-lation [57] likely explains why this pathway predominates in thereactivation phenotype compared to other MAPK pathways inthis setting. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis thatthe MSK pathway provides important kinase activity responsiblefor histone phosphorylation in a CREB dependent manner atspecific promoters. The detection of MSK binding to the MIEPprior to reactivation is supportive of this.In conclusion, we have shown that IE gene expression fromlatency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition andthat reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation ofhistones bound to the latent MIEP. MSK mediated phosphory-lation of these histones is highly dependent on concomitant CREBbinding to the MIEP. Indeed, it is an important consideration thatthese studies relied extensively on the use of chemical inhibitorswhich can have multiple effects on cellular signalling pathwaysover and above their reported specificities and thus will requirefurther investigation. However, an interaction between CREB andMSK at the MIEP provides a mechanism for the signal integrationrequired to promote HCMV reactivation from DCs in an ERK-MAPK dependent manner. Furthermore, using the regulation ofthe MIEP during HCMV latency and reactivation as a model ofdifferential gene expression we provide further in vivo evidence fora functional interaction between MSK and CREB at promoterswhich, in this case, is important for controlling the gene expressionof a clinically important pathogen. Clearly, because the effects ofMSKs on gene expression are restricted to specific promotersfurther de-lineation of the pathways responsible for activation ofthe MIEP provides the potential for new therapeutic interventions.Materials and MethodsEthics statementAll research describing studies on primary human material withHCMV were assessed and approved by the Cambridge LocalResearch Ethics committee.

The expression of IE gene expression is restricted in CD14+ monocytes and isinherently unresponsive to inflammatory IL-6 signalling. However, cellular differentiation to a permissive phenotype renders latently infected cellsresponsive to stimuli that support IE gene expression and, ultimately, reactivation.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195.g009MSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus ReactivationPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195dance with established guidelines for the handling and processing ofsaid tissue by the Cambridge Local Research Ethics committee.Virus, cell lines, culture and reagentsThe clinical isolate TB40/e (a kind gift of Christian Sinzger,University of Tuebeingen, Germany) was purified from infectedhuman retinal pigment epithelial cells using sorbitol gradients aspreviously described [58]. Viruses for these studies werecharacterised by their ability to infect primary dendritic cells toassay myelo-tropism \u2013 routinely, virus preparations infected 10\u201320% DCs when used at an MOI of 5 calculated on fibroblasts.To generate HCMV mutants in the CREB response elements agalk BAC recombineering method was used as describedpreviously [21]. Essentially, base substitutions in the 5 copies ofCRE present in the MIEP was performed by site directedmutagenesis in the P4EDM plasmid and the enhancer fragmentexcised using Eag1 and Bsrg1 restriction digest. For BACmutagenesis, galk primers with 50 bp homology to HCMV MIEflanking +1 to 2580 were used (59- ATC TGA CGG TTC ACTAAA CGA GCT CTG CTT ATA TAG ACC TCC CAC CGTACC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CA and 59- CAGCGT GGA TGG CGT CTC CAG GCG ATC TGA CGG TTCACT AAA CGC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CATAGT ATA TCG GCA TAG) were used to amplify galk withflanking HCMV sequences using galk BAC in SW102. SW105cells containing the TB40/e BAC were electroporated with thegalk fragment and selected for using galactose containing agarplates and MacConkey galactose plates for verification. Sequenceverified positive clones were then subject to a second round ofrecombination which introduced the Enhancer fragment isolatedinitially. Recombinants which had deleted galk were selected foron 2-deoxygalactose containing plates. Purified BACs wereisolated, sequence verified and then transfected into permissivefibroblasts to reconstitute infectious virus.The generation of the NF-KB mutant virus was performed usingthe same BAC mutagenesis protocol to generate point mutationsby site-directed mutagenesis at positions 294, 2157, 2262 and 2413 relative to +1 transcription start site in P4EDM as describedpreviously [59].Primary CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the venous bloodof anonymous donors who had given informed consent under theappropriate local rules. Typically, 50 mls of venous blood wasdiluted in PBS either 1:1 and, following separation on a ficollgradient (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Melville, NY) peripheral bloodmononuclear cells were then purified using either a CD14+ celldirect isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). LabelledCD14+ positive cells were rescued using Magnet Activated CellSorting (MACS) and cultured in X-vivo 15 (Cambrex, Walkers-ville, MD) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine and cytokinesto promote DC differentiation where appropriate.Experimental infection of primary cells anddifferentiationThe establishment of an in vitro experimental latent infection ofprimary CD14+ cells was performed by infecting CD14+monocytes (56105 cells/well) were infected in 250 ul of X-vivo15 media plus HCMV (MOI = 5) for 3 hours then rescued in 1 mlfresh media. After 3 days, experimentally infected CD14+ cellswere differentiated to immature monocyte derived DCs (MoDCs)as described previously [13]. Briefly, CD14+ monocytes werecultured with Interleukin-4 (100 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) to promote differentiation to an interstitial-like DC phenotype[60]. Following culture, immature DCs was matured usingLipopolysaccharide (500 ng/ml; SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) orincubated with recombinant IL-6. All cytokines were fromPeprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) unless otherwise stated.Inhibitors and antibodiesTo test for inhibition of HCMV reactivation, inhibitors wereadded prior to LPS or IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of MEK/ERKwas achieved using U0126 (or inactive analogue U0124; both5 uM), tpl2 (tpl2 kinase Inhibitor II; 1 uM), Raf (Raf KinaseInhibitor IV; 500 nM), RSK (BI-D1870; 500 nM; Selleckchem,Houston, TX) and MSK (H-89; 10 uM; Sigma Aldrich, Poole,UK) inhibitors (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA unlessotherwise stated). All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO andadded 2 hours prior to addition of LPS directly to the culturemedia. Prior to use, all inhibitors were titrated to ensure determinea dose that gave activity against its target without any over effecton the viability of the cells (trypan blue exclusion). To promotehistone H3 phosphorylation, the protein phosphatase 1 and 2Ainhibitor okadaic acid (5 uM, Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK) wasadded to cells 3 hours prior to the induction of reactivation.Where appropriate inhibitors were shown to have no impact onlytic infection of DCs or HFFs and, over the time frame ofanalyses, were shown not to be deleterious to cell viability.For immuno-fluorescent detection of viral antigens, cells werefixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilised with 0.1%Triton X/PBS. An anti-IE (Millipore, 1:1000 in PBS) and thenwith an Alexafluor 594 nm conjugated Goat anti-mouse antibody(Millipore; 1:1000 in PBS). All antibody incubations wereperformed for 1 hour at room temperature.Protein expression was detected by Western blotting ofdenatured protein samples. To detect protein expression nitrocel-lulose filters were incubated at 4uC overnight with anti-CREB oranti-phosphor-CREB antibodies, (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology,Charlottesville, VA), anti-p42/p44 or phosphor-anti-p42/p44antibodies, anti-MSK1 or anti-phosphor-MSK1 (serine 360) (all1:1000; Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA) and anti-STAT-3 or phosphor-STAT-3 (tyrosine 705) (1:250; Santa CruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with a HRPconjugated Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; SantaCruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hr at RT. As a loadingcontrol, nitrocellulose filters were also incubated with a rabbit anti-GAPDH control (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by anHRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000; Santa CruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) \u2013 both antibody incubationsperformed at RT for 1 hr. Blots were processed using ECL plus(GE life sciences, Amersham, UK) and exposed to Kodakautoradiograph film (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK).Nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and PCRRNA was isolated from 106cells using RNAeasy spin columnsas described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Following isolation, total RNA was incubated with DNAse I(Promega, Madison, WI) and then amplified by qRT-PCR. IE,UL138 and GAPDH gene expression was determined using aTaqman Triplex qRT-PCR system (SIGMA, Poole, UK) with thefollowing primers and probes: IE, 59- CAA GAA CTC AGC CTTCCC TAA GAC and 59- TGA GGC AAG TTC TCG AAT GCwith the probe CCA ATG GCT GCA GTC AGG CCA TG-(TAM); UL138, 59- CGC TGT TTC TCT GGT TAG and 59-CAG ACG ATA CCG TTT CTC with the probe CCG ACGACG AAG ACG ATG AAC-(Cy5); and GAPDH, 59- GGA AGCTTG TCA TCA ATG and 59- CCC CAC TTG ATT TTG GAGwith the probe ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG GAG CGA G-(JOE).Reactions were set up using the Qiagen RT-PCR Quantitect kit(Qiagen, Sussex, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019sMSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus ReactivationPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195protocol and the samples amplified for ABI 7500 Fast Real TimePCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; 95uC for 15 sand 60uC for 45 s).Chromatin immunoprecipitation and analysisAll procedures were performed essentially as described previ-ously. Briefly, DCs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (10 mins)and then lysed and sonicated to fragment DNA. DNA associatedwith histones was immunoprecipitated with control serum (Sigma,Poole, UK), anti-phosphor-histone H3-serine 10 antiserum (ChIPgrade, 1:200 dilution), anti-dimethyl lysine 4 histone H3 antiserum(ChIP grade, 1:200), anti-trimethyl lysine 9 H3 antiserum (ChIPgrade, 1:200 dilution), anti-phosphor or total CREB (both 1:250),or anti-MSK1 antibody (1:200 dilution; Cell signalling Technol-ogy, Danvers, MA) - all antibodies Upstate Biotechnology,Charlottesville, VA unless stated. For detection of the MIEP ofHCMV, DNA from disrupted nucleosomes was precipitated andamplified by qPCR using 59-CCAAGTCTCCACCCCATTGAC(sense) and 59-GACATTTTGGAAAGTCCCGTTG (anti-sense)primers and quantified using a Taqman probe FAM-59-TGG-GAGTTTGTTTTGGCACCAAA-39-TMR.

Specific immuno-precipitation of sequences was expressedas enrichment from Input.Adenoviral delivery of MEK1 proteins and analysis inlatencyTo deliver exogenous proteins to primary cells, adenoviralvectors expressing GFP or a dominant negative version of MEK1,were used (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Four days into the 6 daydifferentiation protocol, differentiating cells were infected withadenoviral expression vectors (MOI 250) for 3 hours then themedia replaced with fresh growth media. At Day 6 of differen-tiation (48 hours post adenovirus infection), cells were stimulatedwith IL-6 and then harvested for Western Blot analysis 15 minspost culture, 2 hours post stimulation for ChIP analyses, or leftovernight and subject to either RT-qPCR for IE gene expression.Supporting InformationFigure S1 CREB does not bind to the MIEP of the DCREvirus.
