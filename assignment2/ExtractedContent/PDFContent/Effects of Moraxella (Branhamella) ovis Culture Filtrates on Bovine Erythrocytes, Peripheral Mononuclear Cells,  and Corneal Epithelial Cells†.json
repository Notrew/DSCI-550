Piliated hemolytic Moraxella bovis is recognized as the etiologic agent of IBK.According to data from the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, however, Moraxella (Branha-mella) ovis has been isolated with increasing frequency from cattle affected with IBK. The objective of this studywas, therefore, to examine M. ovis field isolates for the presence of the putative virulence factors of M. bovis.Culture filtrates from selected M. ovis field isolates demonstrated hemolytic activity on bovine erythrocytes andcytotoxic activity on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and corneal epithelial cells. The hemolyticactivity of the culture filtrates was attenuated after heat treatment. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the M.bovis hemolysin-cytotoxin also recognized a protein of approximately 98 kDa in a Western blot assay. Thesedata indicate that the M. ovis field isolates examined produce one or more heat-labile exotoxins and maysuggest that M. ovis plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBK.Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a highly con-tagious disease that affects cattle of all ages and that occursworldwide (27, 28, 31). The adverse economic impact of IBKdue to decreased weight gain and costs of therapeutic treat-ment is estimated to be $150 million annually (27). Piliatedhemolytic strains of Moraxella bovis are recognized as the eti-ologic agents of IBK (5, 10, 11, 23, 35, 36, 37). Moraxella bovis,however, cannot always be recovered from clinical cases; andother organisms, such as Moraxella (Branhamella) ovis, Myco-plasma bovoculi, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, andadenovirus, have been suggested to play a role in the patho-genesis of IBK (17, 19, 31, 37).According to data of the University of Nebraska VeterinaryDiagnostic Laboratory System, M. ovis is isolated with increas-ing frequency from cases of IBK. From 1999 to 2002, M. oviswas isolated three times more often from field cases than M.bovis. Isolation of M. ovis from cases of keratoconjunctivitis haspreviously been reported in sheep, goats, deer, and moose (3,14, 16, 17, 30, 33, 40, 41). In cattle, M. ovis has been isolatedfrom IBK cases (17, 31); but the significance of its isolation iscurrently unclear because, in one study, experimental inocula-tion of calves with M. ovis isolated did not cause keratocon-junctivitis (17). These findings suggest that M. ovis is not apathogen or that additional factors may be required for viru-lence (9, 17, 32, 43).Isolates of M. ovis recovered from cattle with IBK have notbeen examined for potential virulence factors (6, 21, 26, 34,39). In an attempt to elucidate whether M. ovis plays a role inthe etiology and pathogenesis of IBK, the objective of thisstudy was to investigate M. ovis field isolates for the presenceof factors known to be virulence factors in M. bovis by exam-ining the effects of M. ovis culture filtrates on different types ofcells of bovine origin.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial isolates. Moraxella ovis isolates recovered from cattle with IBK werepassed twice on Trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (blood agar;Remel, Lenexa, KS) and were stored at \ufffd80\u00b0C in 15% glycerol. A known virulentisolate of M. bovis, designated Epp63 (20, 35, 36), and a reference isolate of M.ovis (ATCC 19575) recovered from a sheep with conjunctivitis were used in eachassay for comparison. Field isolates of M. ovis were identified by phenotypic andbiochemical criteria. Briefly, M. ovis colonies were 1 to 3 mm in diameter after24 h of incubation, firm, and hemolytic on blood agar; and they tended to slideacross the agar surface when they were touched with a Nichrome wire loop.Microscopically, the M. ovis isolates were gram-negative cocci (0.6 to 1.0 \ufffdm)arranged in pairs. All M. ovis isolates were aerobic and oxidase and catalasepositive, and they reduced nitrate but did not ferment carbohydrates or liquefygelatin (8, 13, 22, 30).Preparation of culture supernatants. Aliquots of each isolate from frozenstock cultures were streaked onto blood agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.Culture for hemolysin production during early-logarithmic-phase growth wasperformed as described previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, threecolonies of each isolate from the blood agar plate were transferred into 3 ml ofbrain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Remel) supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO), and the cultures were incubated for18 h at 37\u00b0C. The cultures were then transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing50 ml of BHI broth supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml and were incubated withshaking (200 rpm) for 4.5 h at 37\u00b0C. The bacterial cells were removed bycentrifugation (12,000 \ufffd g) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the culture supernatants weretransferred to sterile centrifuge tubes. Each supernatant was filtered through a0.22-\ufffdl polysulfone syringe filter (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), andthe cell-free supernatants (CFSs) were either used immediately or frozen at\ufffd80\u00b0C until use. An aliquot of each CFS was plated on blood agar to verifysterility.Hemolytic activity assay.

Thehemolytic activity of each CFS was analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates asdescribed previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, twofold dilutions (1:2 to1:2,048) of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 \ufffdl of a 0.15 M sodiumchloride (Sigma) solution containing 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer (Sigma) and 10 mMCaCl2 (Sigma) buffer (NTC buffer). Wells with distilled water served as positivecontrol wells, and wells with NTC buffer served as negative control wells. Onehundred microliters of 2% washed bovine erythrocytes in PBS was added to eachwell, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Intact erythrocytes werepelleted by centrifugation (1,500 \ufffd g) for 5 min, and 100 \ufffdl of each supernatantwas then transferred to a new plate. The absorbance (optical density [OD] at 410nm) was determined for each well by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). The mean ab-sorbance was calculated for each set of wells, and the titers were determined byusing the reciprocals of the last dilution with absorbance values above 5% of themean of the positive control wells.To determine whether the hemolytic activity of M. ovis CFS was heat labile, 1ml of each CFS was incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 56\u00b0C and was thenallowed to cool to room temperature. The hemolytic activity of each CFS wasthen analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates as described above. In addition, eachCFS was stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h and the hemolytic activity was determined asdescribed above.Preparation of bovine PBMCs. Bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) were prepared as described previously (20). Briefly, freshly collectedblood in EDTA was centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The buffy coats wereremoved and diluted with PBS, and the mixture was layered onto Ficoll-Paque(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then centrifuged (700 \ufffd g)for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. The PBMCs were then collected from the interface, washed threetimes in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and counted in a hemocytometer.Cytotoxic activity assay. The density of the PBMCs was adjusted to a concen-tration of 5 \ufffd 106 cells/ml for the dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) reduction cytotoxicity assay, and the cytoxic activity of each CFS wasdetermined in 96-well microtiter plates as described previously (20). Briefly,twofold serial dilutions of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 \ufffdl of 1\ufffdRPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetalcalf serum. One hundred microliters of the PBMC suspension was added to eachwell, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, theplates were centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded.One hundred microliters of clear 1\ufffd RPMI 1640 medium and 20 \ufffdl of MTT(Sigma) dye solution (5 mg MTT in 1 ml distilled H2O) were then added to eachwell, and plates were again incubated until a colored reaction product was visible(2 to 4 h). The plates were then centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 5 min, the supernatantwas discarded, and 100 \ufffdl of acid isopropanol was added to each well. Gentleagitation was used to dissolve the formazan precipitate. The absorbance of eachwell was determined on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader by usinga test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The percentcytotoxicity for each well was determined as follows: [1 \ufffd (OD of toxin-treatedmononuclear cells/OD of untreated PBMCs)] \ufffd 100. The untreated PBMCswere used as cell viability controls.The cytotoxic activity titer in each well was determined by using the reciprocalof the highest dilution that caused the cytolysis of 50% or more of the target cellscompared to the level of cytolysis of the cells control wells. One hundred micro-liters of the PBMC suspension and 100 \ufffdl of RPMI 1640 medium were used toassess cell viability, and 100 \ufffdl of medium and 100 \ufffdl of undiluted CFS were usedto assess nonspecific dye reduction.Corneal epithelial cell culture. Corneas were collected from three clinicallyhealthy calves immediately following euthanasia. After removal of the globes andthe attached conjunctival sacs, the ocular tissues were briefly rinsed with 70%ethyl alcohol and were then rinsed twice with sterile 0.85% saline solution. Asterile scalpel blade was used to remove the cornea at the limbus, and the cornealepithelium was dissected away from the underlying stroma. The corneal epithe-lium was then rinsed three times in sterile 1\ufffd RPMI 1640 medium containing0.003% gentamicin sulfate (Sigma). The corneal epithelium was minced with asterile scalpel blade in a sterile glass petri dish and then transferred to cultureflasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serumand 0.003% gentamicin sulfate (c-RPMI). The flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C in7% CO2 for 72 h. After incubation, the medium was decanted and the flasks werewashed once with warm (37\u00b0C) sterile PBS. Fresh c-RPMI medium was thenadded to each flask, and the flasks were again incubated at 37\u00b0C in 7% CO2.Fresh c-RPMI medium was added to each flask at 72-h intervals or until 100%confluent cell monolayers had formed. The confluent cells were detached with2.5% trypsin (Sigma), resuspended in c-RPMI, transferred to 96-well cultureplates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 7% CO2 for approximately 72 h or until 90%confluent cell monolayers had formed in the wells.Corneal epithelial cell cytotoxicity assay. Medium from each corneal epithelialcell monolayer plate was discarded, and 10 \ufffdl of fresh c-RPMI medium wasadded to each well. Fifty microliters of a CFS was then added to each well, while50 \ufffdl of BHI broth was added to each control well. The plates were incubated at37\u00b0C in 7% CO2 for 2 h. Medium from each plate was then discarded, and 200\ufffdl of fresh clear c-RPMI medium was added to each well. Each plate was thenexamined at \ufffd400 magnification with an inverted microscope. The assay wasperformed three times in duplicate.Western blot analyses of M. bovis Epp63 and M. ovis CFS. CFS proteins fromtwo M. ovis field isolates, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovis Epp63 wereseparated by standard 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis (SDS-PAGE), as described previously (38), and then transferred to anitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A kaleidoscopeprestained standard (Bio-Rad) was used to assess transfer efficiency. The non-specific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 1% fish gelatin(Sigma) and 0.5% skim milk (Carnation) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primaryantibody, a polyclonal rabbit serum raised against a partially purified extract ofhemolytic M. bovis strain T\ufffd (2) (kindly provided by L. George, University ofCalifornia\u2014Davis), was used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS. After 1 h of incubationin primary antibody at ambient temperature, the membrane was washed (PBScontaining 500 \ufffdl/liter Tween 20 [Bio-Rad]) and then incubated for 1 h in a1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI). Detection of bound secondary an-tibody was by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and autoradiography.Normal rabbit serum was substituted for anti-M. bovis antibodies as a negativecontrol in the protocol.FIG. 1. Hemolytic activities of M. bovis and M. ovis isolates on bovine erythrocytes with and without heat treatment. Bars indicate the geometricmean titers of the hemolytic activities of the CFSs from M. bovis Epp63, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and five M. ovis field isolates without heat treatment(A). Heat treatment consisted of incubation of the CFSs at 56\u00b0C and cooling to room temperature prior to use in the hemolysin assay (B). Errorbars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the means. The results shown represent data from five independent replications of each set ofexperiments.VOL. 44, 2006 POTENTIAL VIRULENCE FACTORS OF MORAXELLA OVIS 773RESULTSHemolytic activities of CFSs on bovine erythrocytes. TheCFSs from all isolates demonstrated hemolytic activities in theassay, with titers ranging from 256 to 2,048 for the five M. ovisfield isolates and from 4,096 to 8,192 for the M. bovis Epp63isolate (Fig. 1A). Heat treatment of the CFSs before the he-molysin assay was conducted attenuated the hemolytic activity,as the titers of the M. ovis CFSs observed after heat treatmentranged only from 2 to 4 (Fig. 1B). This effect was also evidentwhen heat-treated and non-heat-treated CFSs were run side byside for direct comparison (Fig. 2). In this series of assays,non-heat-treated M. ovis CFSs had hemolytic activity titers of1,024 to 2,048 that were reduced to titers of 2 to 4 after heattreatment. Non-heat-treated M. bovis CFS titers were 4,096 to8,192, and the titers after heat treatment were 8 to 32. Whenthe CFSs were stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h prior to the assay,hemolytic activity was reduced by three- to fourfold dilutions inthe M. ovis CFSs (titer range, 32 to 256) and one- to three folddilutions in the M. bovis Epp63 CFSs (titer range, 1,024 to2,048) (data not shown). Because of the consistent hemolyticactivities of their CFSs, field isolates 3 and 5 were selected foruse in the cytotoxicity assays and in Western blot analyses.Cytotoxic activities of CFSs on bovine PBMCs. The CFSs ofM. ovis field isolates 3 and 5, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovisEpp63 demonstrated cytotoxic activities on bovine PBMCs,with geometric mean titers ranging from 64 to 16 (data notshown).Effects of CFSs on bovine corneal epithelial cells. Exposureof corneal cell monolayers to CFSs from M. ovis field isolates3 and 5 and M. bovis Epp63 resulted in cell detachment andcomplete loss of the cell monolayers within 2 h. The CFS fromM. ovis ATCC 19575, however, did not cause any noticeablemonolayer disruption or the loss of cells (Fig. 3).SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of CFSs. The poly-clonal primary antibody recognizes a cluster of repeats in toxin(RTX) A proteins of M. bovis strain T\ufffd (2). These antibodiesalso recognized several proteins in the M. bovis Epp63 CFS(Fig. 4, lane M. bovis Epp63). A cluster of strong bands mi-grated at about 90 to 100 kDa, and another cluster migrated atabout 80 to 88 kDa. Several proteins were also detected in theM. ovis CFS (Fig. 4). The distribution of bands in all M. ovislanes, however, was such that the more prominent bands mi-grated at lower molecular masses. A single band of about 98kDa recognized in the M. bovis CFS was also recognized in allM. ovis CFSs. When preimmunization rabbit serum was usedas the primary antibody, no bands were seen (data not shown),indicating that the bands detected by the anti-M. bovis serumare due to a specific antigen-antibody reaction and are not dueto nonspecific binding of the antibody.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study indicate that M. ovis isolates recov-ered from cattle with IBK produce one or more heat-labileexotoxins that demonstrate hemolytic activity on bovine eryth-rocytes and cytotoxic activity on bovine PBMCs and cornealepithelial cells. The data indicate that, like the known virulentisolate M. bovis Epp63 (12, 20, 21, 25, 27), the M. ovis isolatestested also possess hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. The he-molytic and cytotoxic activities of M. bovis are mediated by ahemolysin, a calcium-dependent, pore-forming RTX (2, 5, 7,12, 20). Although the definite nature of the toxic activities ofFIG. 2. Comparison of hemolytic activities of M. bovis and M. ovisfield isolates after heat treatment. Prior to the assay, the CFSs weretreated as described in the legend to Fig. 1, but heat-treated (light graybars) and non-heat-treated (dark gray bars) CFSs were run side byside. Bars indicate the geometric mean titers of the hemolytic activitiesof the CFSs from M. bovis Epp63 and two of the five M. ovis fieldisolates (isolates 3 and 5), as in Fig. 1. Error bars represent the 95%confidence intervals of the means. The results shown represent datafrom three independent replications.FIG. 3. Effects of CFSs on bovine corneal epithelial cell monolay-ers. Monolayers of corneal epithelial cells were either not exposed toany CFS (negative control) (A) or exposed to M. ovis ATCC 19575CFS (B), exposed to M. ovis field isolates 3 (C) or 5 (D), or exposed toM. bovis Epp63 CFS (positive control) (E). Note the complete disrup-tion of the monolayers exposed to CFSs produced by field isolates 3and 5 and M. bovis Epp63. The photomicrographs shown are repre-sentative of three independent replications. Bar, 100 \ufffdm.774 CERNY ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.M. ovis CFSs has yet to be determined, it is possible, based onthe similarity of action, that these effects are mediated by anexotoxin qualitatively similar to the M. bovis RTX. Substantialattenuation of the hemolytic activity of the M. ovis CFS afterheat treatment also suggests that the presumptive M. ovis exo-toxin is proteinaceous, like the M. bovis RTX. Based on theobservation that the titers of the M. bovis CFSs were slightlyhigher in this assay, it may be speculated that the M. ovisexotoxin is more readily inactivated. A similar tendency wasevident when CFSs were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h before thehemolysin assay was conducted. This difference could be due tostructural or conformational differences in the proteins or tothe activity of proteolytic enzymes released by M. ovis duringlogarithmic growth (4, 18). The objective of this study, how-ever, was to examine selected M. ovis field isolates for thepresence of potential virulence factors, and no attempt wasmade to quantify the hemolytic or the cytotoxic activity.The primary antibody used in the Western blot assay spe-cifically recognized the M. bovis toxin, but it also recognizedseveral proteins in the M. ovis CFSs. A cluster of bands ofapproximately 95 to 100 kDa may be significant because thismolecular mass is consistent with those of recognized RTXs(18, 42), including M. bovis RTX A (1, 2). A single band in allM. ovis CFSs migrated at this particular molecular mass, sug-gesting some structural similarity. The identities of the severallower-molecular-mass bands present in the M. ovis lanes areunknown at this time. Other investigators have shown thatfull-length RTXs degrade after only a few hours in culture, andspecific antibodies recognize several smaller degradation prod-ucts (2, 18). If it is assumed that a toxin is present in the M. ovisCFS, it is possible that those lower-molecular-mass bands rep-resent the degradation products of a full-length toxin.The M. ovis isolates examined in this study differed in theirhemolytic and cytotoxic activities. This may suggest that theisolates are different strains, but no testing was done to deter-mine if these isolates were indeed different strains. The num-ber of animal passages of each of the M. ovis field isolatesreceived prior to laboratory isolation is unknown, and thenumber of animal and laboratory passages of M. ovis ATCC19575 is also unknown. Interestingly, M. ovis ATCC 19575 didnot exhibit any cytotoxicity to bovine corneal epithelial cells,although toxicity to erythrocytes and peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells was observed. Intraspecies variation (e.g., straindifferences), as suggested above, does not likely account forthese results. It has been shown for M. bovis that only piliatedisolates can adhere to bovine corneal epithelial cells (24, 29);and it is possible, therefore, that isolate ATCC 19575 was notpiliated and could not adhere to the corneal cells to exert atoxic effect. Some RTXs have been shown to specifically rec-ognize and bind to a host cell receptor (15, 41), and it is alsopossible that the presumptive hemolysin of the ATCC 19575strain lacked this ability. It is also noteworthy that the ATCC19575 isolate is of sheep origin, and a toxin produced duringpassages in sheep may act on the cornea in a strictly species-specific manner but may act more promiscuously on erythro-cytes and PBMCs. The M. ovis isolates were not examined forpiliation, and the reasons for differences in activity between thetwo M. ovis field isolates and the ATCC 19575 isolate remainspeculative.Currently, piliated and hemolytic M. bovis isolates arerecognized as the etiologic agents of IBK. Data from theNebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, how-ever, indicate that M. ovis is isolated from the majority ofcattle with IBK. From January 1999 through December2002, samples from a total of 109 cases of IBK were receivedat the Veterinary Diagnostic Center. In 79 cases (72.5%), M.ovis was the only agent isolated, whereas in 18 cases(16.5%), M. bovis was the only pathogen isolated. In 12cases (11%), both M. ovis and M. bovis isolates were recov-ered. Other investigators have isolated M. ovis from cattlewith IBK (17, 31), but experimental inoculation of calveswith M. ovis isolates did not cause keratoconjunctivitis inone study (17). Although the M. ovis isolates in anotherstudy exhibited hemolytic activity on blood agar (31), theywere not examined for cytotoxic activity or piliation. Thesefindings might suggest that M. ovis, if it is pathogenic, mayrequire initial corneal damage or other predisposing factorsto cause disease in cattle. Moraxella bovis isolates differ intheir virulence; some isolates readily cause disease experi-mentally, while others require corneal damage to cause dis-ease (11, 19, 34). Differences in virulence may also be acommon to M. ovis isolates. Since only piliated, hemolyticisolates of M. bovis are pathogenic for cattle (35), pili mayalso be necessary for M. ovis to attach to and colonize bovinecornea and conjunctiva. This hypothesis should be furtheraddressed by using M. ovis field isolates from cattle. Al-though the results of this study indicate that M. ovis fieldisolates from cattle produce one or more exotoxins, furthercharacterization of this suspected M. ovis toxin and studiesthat examine the piliation of field isolates and adherence ofM. ovis to the bovine cornea are necessary to substantiatethe potential role of M. ovis in the pathogenesis of IBK.FIG. 4.
