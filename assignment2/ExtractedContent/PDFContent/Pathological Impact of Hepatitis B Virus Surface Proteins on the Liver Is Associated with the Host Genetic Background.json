Here, we have investigated pathological cellular effects ofHBV surface protein expression in the liver of transgenic mice with different genetic background.Methods: The impact of HBV surface protein expression on the liver was studied in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6.Histology and hydroxyproline assays were performed to investigate liver morphology and fibrosis. Gene expression andsignaling were analyzed by microarray, qPCR and Western blotting.Results: Expression of HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice induced activation of protein kinase-likeendoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF2aresulted in activation of the ER stress markers glucose regulated protein (GRP) 78 and pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologousprotein (CHOP) in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic background leading to stronger liver injury and fibrosis in comparisonwith transgenic mice on C57BL/6 background. Hepatic stellate cells represented the main collagen-producing liver cells inHBV transgenic mice. The key regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, transcription factors c-Jun and STAT3 were activated inHBV transgenic mice. Tumour incidence in transgenic mice was strain- and sex-dependent.Conclusions: Extent of liver injury, fibrosis, and tumour development induced by hepatic HBV surface protein expressionconsiderably depends on host genetic background.Citation: Churin Y, Roderfeld M, Stiefel J, Wu\u0308rger T, Schro\u0308der D, et al.

Althoughmuch is known about HBV structure and replicative cycle [2] thepathogenic mechanisms responsible for liver injury, cirrhosisdevelopment and malignant transformation during chronic HBVinfection are not well understood. It is believed that these eventsoriginate from persistent immune pathogenesis [3], but observa-tions in transgenic mouse models of HBV infection suggest that inabsence of an adaptive immune responses cellular mechanismsinduced by HBV proteins may also lead to the development ofthese liver diseases [4,5].The HBV transgenic mice used in the current study contain asub-genomic HBV DNA fragment (genotype D, subtype ayw)encoding the three co-carboxyterminal HBV surface (HBs)proteins under the control of the liver-specific murine albuminpromoter [6]. Although these transgenic mice have been shown todevelop chronic liver injury, regenerative hyperplasia, as well asadenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) [7,8] themechanisms of HBs proteins pathogenicity are poorly understood.The HBs protein expression pattern in this mouse model mimicsthe situation in the liver of patients with enhanced intracellularPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/expression and retention of Hepatitis B virus surface proteins, e. g.patients with Hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treatedby transplantation. The liver damage in these patients wasattributable to a direct hepatocytotoxic effect of HBV, since theywere on a similar immunosuppresion regime [9,10].Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates theunfolded protein response (UPR) that is sensed by the bindingimmunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78) [11\u201313]. Distinct branches of UPR are mediated bythree different classes of ER-membrane transducers: inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6(ATF6) or protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase(PERK). PERK activation causes the phosphorylation of thealpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (eIF2a)[11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a reduction in theinitiation of mRNA translation thus reducing the load of newproteins that require folding in the ER. However, the expression ofsome proteins is enhanced. One of them is the C/EBPhomologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest andDNA damage-inducible gene (GADD) 153 that mediates pro-apoptotic pathways emanating from the stressed ER [11,14].Previously it was shown that GRP78 expression was increased in ahuman hepatoma cell line that overproduced HBs proteins [15]and in the liver of transgenic mice that expressed deletion mutantof large HBs [16].Hepatic fibrosis constitutes the wound healing response to liverinjury. During fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activationrepresents a critical event, because these cells become the primarysource of extracellular matrix in the liver upon damage [17].Development of hepatic fibrosis after chemical liver injury isenhanced in BALB/c mice exhibiting a Th2 response compared toC57BL/6 mice, which demonstrated a primary Th1 response[18]. Transgenic mice on fibrosis-resistant C57BL/6 geneticbackground, which over-produce HBs proteins, develop modestspontaneous liver fibrosis [19,20].Transcription factor c-Jun and signal transducer and activatorof transcription (STAT) 3 are implicated in several cellularprocesses including proliferation, survival, and cell transformation[21,22]. They are activated in chemically induced murine livertumours and in HCCs of humans [23,24], suggesting an importantfunction for these proteins in the development of liver tumours.Here we report that the production of HBV surface proteinsstimulates the expression of CHOP in hepatocytes and could causestronger liver damage in transgenic mice on BALB/c geneticbackground compared to C57BL/6. Furthermore, HBV trans-genic mice develop hepatic fibrosis and the level of fibrosisdepends on the genetic background. Although c-Jun transcriptionfactor up-regulation and activation of STAT3 and PERK in theliver of transgenic mice might contribute to tumour development,CHOP expression might reduce tumorigenesis in transgenic miceon BALB/c genetic background.Materials and MethodsAnimal ModelTransgenic mice were maintained at the Central AnimalLaboratory of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen under specifiedpathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strictaccordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Careand Use of Laboratory Animals of the German law of animalwelfare. The mice received humane care, and all experimentswere approved by the Committee on the ethics of AnimalExperiments of the Regierungspraesidium Giessen, Giessen,Germany (permit number: V54-19c 20 15 h 01 GI20/10 Nr.52/2011 and Nr. A5/2012).Generation and characteristics of transgenic lineages Tg(Alb-1HBV), internal designation (HBVTg/6) have been describedpreviously [8]. The HBVTg/6 strain had an inbred C57BL/6genetic background and was propagated by crossing hemizygoustransgenic males to C57BL/6 females. These mice werebackcrossed to fibrosis susceptible BALB/c genetic background[18] for at least 6 generations. The obtained transgenic mouse linewas internally designed HBVTg/c. At age of 12, 26, and 52 weeksmice were killed by CO2-inhalation. Liver samples were collectedand preserved for analyses in accordance with application. Serumsamples were stored at 280uC until analysis of alanine amino-transferase (ALT) by routine clinical chemistry on a Reflotron PlusAnalyzer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).Histology and Hydroxyproline AssayImmediately after necropsy, liver samples for histology werefixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 16hours and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mm) werestained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or 0.1% Sirius RedF3B in saturated picric acid (Chroma, Mu\u0308nster, Germany) for thedetection of collagen fibers [25]. The entire content of collagenwas determined by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification [26].ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using ImmPRESSPeroxidase Detection Reagents (Vector Laboratories) and anti-bodies specific for HBsAg (20-HR20), GADD153 (F-168, SantaCruz), Desmin and GFAP (Lab Vision), c-Jun (60A8, CellSignaling), BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling). Colour reaction wasdeveloped with VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit or DABPeroxidase Substrate Kit, (Vector Laboratories). The percentageof BiP, Desmin, and GFAP-positive area was determined usingImageJ image analysis system (National Institutes of Health,Bethesda, MD, USA).Western Blot AnalysisTotal liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting usingantibodies against HBsAg (20-HR20, Fitzgerald), GADD153 (F-168, Santa Cruz), phospho-PERK (16F8, Cell Signaling), PERK(H-300, Santa Cruz), phospho-eIF2a (119A11, Cell Signaling),eIF2a (L57A5, Cell Signaling), b-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling),JNK2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signaling), phospho-c-Jun (D47G9, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11, CellSignaling), STAT3 (79D7, Cell Signaling), phospho-STAT3(D3A7, Cell Signaling).Assay for HBV-specific proteinsHBsAg was measured in serum and in liver lysates by an in-house sandwich ELISA as described [27]. HBsAg amount perhepatocyte was calculated based on the hepatocellularity numberfor mouse 135 million cells per gram of liver [28].Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR and quality control of allsteps were performed as described previously [29]. Primers werepurchased from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany). qPCR data wereanalysed using DDCt method [30].Microarray analysisMicroarray experiments were performed with total RNA fromthe liver of 12-week-old mice as described previously [31].

For non-normally distributed parameters, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman rank test were applied. The resultsare presented as mean6SEM. A two-sided p,0.05 was consideredsignificant (shown as * in the figures].ResultsLiver damage induced by HBs proteins expressiondepends on host genetic backgroundTransgenic mice were sacrificed at week 12, 26, and 52. Toestimate the level of liver cell damage we have measured alaninetransaminase (ALT) in serum. Activities of serum ALT weremarkedly increased already in 12-week-old HBVTg/c micecompared to the wild-type and remained at that level during theobservation period. In HBVTg/6 mice the ALT elevation wasmoderate at week 12 but increased later to levels almost as high asin HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1A). Histological analysis revealed nosignificant lymphocyte infiltration of the liver from 12-week-oldtransgenic mice (Figure S1A). Furthermore, amounts of HBsAgper hepatocyte in 12-week-old mice were similar: 0.42 pg/cell(range, 0.18\u20130.71 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and 0.31 pg/cell(range, 0.15\u20130.64 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/6. Immunohisto-chemical and Western blot analyses of livers from transgenic micealso showed that distributions and expression levels of HBsproteins were similar in mice on both C57BL/6 and BALB/cgenetic backgrounds (Figure S1B and S2). Moreover, amounts ofHBsAg in serum of transgenic mice did not differ significantly:2.02 ng/ml (range, 0.68\u20133.19 ng/ml; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and1.34 ng/ml (range, 0.68\u20132.55 ng/ml; n = 4) for HBVTg/6. Thus,the elevated serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice could be aconsequence of a specific host response to the presence of HBsproteins.To identify the pathways which are activated in the HBs-expressing liver tissue we carried out transcriptional profiling usingmicroarray analysis. As illustrated in Table 1 a set of genes that isknown to be induced by UPR is up-regulated in the liver of 12-week-old transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of geneddit3 that encodes CHOP protein is stronger up-regulated in theliver of HBVTg/c mice compared to HBVTg/6. To confirm thisfinding we studied the expression of CHOP by qRT-PCR andWestern blot analysis. Transcription of the ddit3 gene was stronglyactivated in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice and declined thereafterwith age, whereas in HBVTg/6 mice ddit3 transcription was ratherweakly enhanced in 12-week-old mice and increased with age(Figure S3). Western blot analysis of liver proteins revealed thatCHOP was up-regulated much stronger in HBVTg/c micecompared to HBVTg/6 (Fig. 1B). Selective CHOP translationdepends on eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK after induction ofUPR [11]. However, we detected similar level of PERK activationand eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver from both mouse strainsirrespective of gender and age (Fig. 1C and D). Interestingly, otherUPR sensors ATF6 and IRE1 as well as eIF2a kinases PKR(protein kinase R) and GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2)[32] were not activated in the liver of transgenic mice (data notshown). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in the liver oftransgenic mice leads to the specific activation of the PERKbranch of UPR in hepatocytes from both mouse strains, butexpression of CHOP was much stronger in HBVTg/c mice.Enhanced translation of CHOP results in liver damage and couldexplain higher serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice.To examine the location of CHOP expressing hepatocytesimmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. According to ourprevious finding a significant part of hepatocytes from 12-week-oldHBVTg/c mice accumulated CHOP in the nucleus and theamount of CHOP-positive hepatocytes declined with age, whereaswe could detect only a few hepatocytes in HBVTg/6 liverpositively stained for CHOP independent of age (Figure 2A).Interesting, CHOP-positive hepatocytes were located in centri-lobular areas which surround a hepatic central vein (Figure 2A).Furthermore, induction of UPR leads to activation of the majorsensor of unfolded protein accumulation BiP/GRP78 [12]. IHCdemonstrated strong expression of BiP in selected hepatocytes incentrilobular areas (Figure 2B and Figure S4), although Westernblot analysis did not reveal any differences between wild-type andtransgenic mice in expression of BiP/GRP78 (data not shown).Thus, expression of HBs proteins activated the UPR downstreampathway (CHOP and BiP) much stronger in the liver of transgenicmice on BALB/c genetic background compared to C57BL/6.This activation is located in centrilobular zones of the liver.Liver fibrosisMeasurement of liver hydroxyproline content demonstrated thedevelopment of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice (Figure 3A).Enhanced hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Sirius red staining aswell. We observed minimal fibrosis in the liver of 12-week-oldmice. But fibrosis constantly increased with age. However,HBVTg/c mice accumulated more collagen (Figure S5). Hepaticstellate cells (HSC) are the primary effector cells responsible for thedeposition of ECM in normal and fibrotic liver [33]. Therefore,we tested the expression of HSC activation markers. We detectedincreased amounts of GFAP- and desmin- positive cells in the liverof transgenic mice, thus demonstrating HSC proliferation in theliver of transgenic mice (Figure 3B and Figure S6). Moreover,double staining of desmin with specific antibodies and collagenwith Sirius red has shown co-localization of HSCs with collagenfibres (Figure S7). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins inmouse liver induces development of hepatic fibrosis, whichcorrelated with liver injury. HSCs might be the main collagen-producing cells in this mouse model.HBs protein-induced tumour development depends onhost genetic backgroundMicroarray analysis showed an up-regulation of c-jun geneexpression in transgenic mice independent of genetic background(Table 1). These results were confirmed using qPCR. Maximalexpression was detected in the liver of 52-week-old mice (FigureS8). Expression of c-Jun protein was increased in the liver of 12-,26-, and 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Major parts ofhepatocytes of 52-week-old mice accumulated c-Jun in the nucleus(Figure S9). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK) stimulates its ability to activate transcription [34,35].Western blot analyses demonstrated that JNKs were activated(Figure 4B) and the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was indeedincreased in the liver of 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4C).Thus, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of transgenic miceleads to activation of c-Jun expression.STAT3 activation was observed in mouse models of liver injuryand in human liver diseases in the context of inflammation andcancer [22]. Therefore, we examined the status of STAT3activation in the liver of HBV transgenic mice. Western blotanalysis of liver protein extracts revealed STAT3 activation in thePathological Impact of HBV Surface ProteinsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608liver of male but not female mice (Figure 4D). Thus, expression ofHBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice results inSTAT3 activation in a gender-dependent manner.Up-regulation of c-Jun expression and STAT3 activation couldpromote hepatic tumour growth [21,22]. We checked transgenicmice for occurrence of liver tumour. In young mice (12- and 26-week-old) mice we could detect no tumours. However, they weredetected in 100% (6/6) of 52-week-old male and 20% (1/5) offemale HBVTg/6 mice, whereas only 58% (7/12; X2= 3.46;p = 0.06) of 52-week-old male and 0% (0/6) of female HBVTg/cmice develop tumours. Hence, development of tumours in HBVtransgenic mice was age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.DiscussionIn this study we investigated the effects of HBVs proteinsexpression in the liver of transgenic mice BALB/c and C57BL/6genetic background. Since we observed only weak strain-independent immune cell infiltration of transgenic mice liver(Figure S1) this model could be considered as one with impairedimmune reaction. One important negative impact of immunedeficiency on chronic HBV infection in human is related to thedirect cytotoxicity of high levels of HBs and other HBV proteins[9,10,36]. Low serum HBsAG titers were associated with strongintracellular accumulation of HBs in HBV transgenic mice onboth genetic backgrounds. This condition was also seen in somepatients with late phases of chronic HBV infection [37,38]. Thus,transgenic mice expressing HBs proteins reflect the situation in theliver of HBV-infected patients demonstrated strong retention ofHBsAg in hepatocytes.Higher serum ALT activities in HBVTg/c mice suggeststronger liver injury compared to HBVTg/6 (Figure 1A). Sincethe level of cellular infiltration was low in the liver of transgenicmice on both genetic backgrounds we searched for other reasonsof hepatocyte death. Increased CHOP expression as a result ofprolonged ER stress promotes cell death, whereas CHOP deletionprotects against the death of ER-stressed cells [14]. Stronglyincreased transcription and protein accumulation of CHOP inHBVTg/c mice (Figure 1B and 2A; Figure S3) inducinghepatocyte death could explain increased serum ALT level inthese mice. Expression of CHOP is mediated by phosphorylationof eIF2a [32] that in turn is phosphorylated by PERK [11].Interestingly, levels of PERK activation and eIF2a phosphoryla-tion were similar in the liver of both HBV transgenic mouse strains(Figure 1C and 1D). Two other branches of UPR IRE1a andATF6 were not activated in the liver of HBV transgenic mice (datanot shown). PERK branch activation is largely sustained withunmitigated ER stress, whereas persistent ER stress attenuatesIRE1a and ATF6 signaling [39]. Therefore, permanent expres-sion of HBs proteins leads to the activation of persistent ER stressin hepatocytes that induces PERK and impairs another branchesFigure 1.

It is possible that this situation is common for chronicliver disease comprising ER stress induction.It was previously shown that despite PERK activation andeIF2a phosphorylation in the liver of patients with nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), downstream effectors such as CHOP remain inactive[40]. A similar situation was observed in the liver of HBVtransgenic mice on C57BL/6 genetic background. However,stimulation of CHOP and BiP expression in HBVTg/c micedemonstrated that the outcome of UPR induction depends on thegenetic background of subjects. Furthermore, several studies havedemonstrated that PERK function is critical for maintainingcellular redox homeostasis, promotes cancer cell proliferation andtumour growth [41]. Thus, sustained activation of PERK couldalso promote cancer development in the liver of HBV transgenicmice.Global reduction of translation initiation due to PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation [32] should also affect theexpression of HBs proteins in the liver. This suggests the followingfeed-back mechanism: PERK activation results in the reduction ofHBs translation and that leads to a balance between PERKactivation and HBs protein synthesis in hepatocytes.Development of tumours in HBV transgenic mice as it wasshown by us and others [8] is age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.In this study we observed a strong up-regulation of c-Jun hepaticexpression and an activation of STAT3, whose role in tumori-genesis is well established [22,23,42]. Jun controls liver cancerinitiation and is required for development of chemically inducedHCC [23]. Interestingly, transgenic mice comprising the whole orpartial HBV genome are also more susceptible to chemicallyinduced hepatocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Likewise, hepatitis C viruscore protein potentiates chemically induced HCC through c-Junand STAT3 activation [45]. Thus, stimulation of c-Jun expressionand STAT3 activation by HBs proteins could promote thedevelopment of liver cancer induced by different causes, such assustained inflammation, activation of oncogenes etc. Furthermore,the finding that STAT3 was activated in male mice only correlatedwith our observation that tumour development in HBV transgenicmice is gender-dependent. There is accumulating evidence thattumour-specific ER stress can be exploited for cancer therapy bytreatment with ER stress-aggravating compounds [46]. Moderate,transient ER stress response represents an adaptive mechanism tosupport cellular survival. However, severe and excessive stressconditions could turn this response system to its pro-apoptoticmode. Stimulation of CHOP expression in HBVTg/c miceindicated an activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress responses inthe liver and resulted in reduced tumour incidence in 52-week-oldHBVTg/c mice.Taken together, the outcome of HBV surface proteinsexpression in the liver of transgenic mice depends on the hostgenetic background. Liver injury and fibrosis were increased intransgenic mice on BALB/c background compared to C57BL/6correlating with strong expression of PERK downstream pro-apoptotic effector CHOP. More interesting finding is geneticbackground-independent stimulation of c-Jun expression togetherwith STAT3 and PERK activation promoting cancer cellproliferation and tumour growth. However, activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress response could result in reduced tumourincidence in the liver.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Representative liver histology and distribu-tion of HBs proteins in hepatocytes of transgenic mice.(A) H&E staining of liver sections from 12-, 26-, and 52-week-oldmice HBVTg/c and HBVTg/6 mice.
