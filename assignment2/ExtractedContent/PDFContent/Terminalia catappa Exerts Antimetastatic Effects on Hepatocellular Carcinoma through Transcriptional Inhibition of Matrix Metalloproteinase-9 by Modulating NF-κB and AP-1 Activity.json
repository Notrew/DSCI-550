Previous studies have identified that Terminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) exert hepatoprotective, antioxidative,antiinflammatory, anticancer, and antimetastatic activities. However, the effects of TCE on HCC and the underlying molecularmechanisms of its activities have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study\u2019s findings demonstrate that TCE concentrationdependently inhibits human HCC migration/invasion. Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that TCE inhibitedthe activities and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Assessment of mRNA levels, using reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR, and promoter assays confirmed the inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9expression in HCC cells. The inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 proceeded by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), as well as suppressing nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) andactivating protein-1 (AP-1) on the MMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, TCE inhibits MMP-9 expression and HCCcell metastasis and, thus, has potential use as a chemopreventive agent. Its inhibitory effects are associated with downregulation ofthe binding activities of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1.1. IntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignantneoplasm and major cause of cancer-related deaths in Asiancountries. A high mortality rate for HCC in Taiwan is princi-pally caused by uncontrolled tumor invasion and metastasis[1]. Cancer cell metastasis involves multiple processes andvarious cytophysiological changes, including changes in theadhesive capability between cells and the extracellular matrix(ECM). This involves proteolytic degradation and damagedintracellular interaction. Degradation of the ECM by cancercells occurs through proteases, such as serine proteinaseand the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This leads tothe separation of the intercellular matrix to promote themobility of cancer cells, eventually leading to metastasis[2]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9 or gelatinase B,mailto:hlchiou@csmu.edu.twmailto:ysf@csmu.edu.tw2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine92 kDa) is the proteases most significantly involved in thedegradation of the basement membrane and, thus, in tumorinvasion and metastasis. A number of pathological states,including cancer, inflammation, and vascular diseases, areassociated with increased proteinase activities [3, 4]. Theexpression of MMPs is regulated by various factors, suchas growth factors, cytokines, and proteinase inhibitors. Theendogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)are the specific inhibitors of MMPs. Imbalance betweenthe MMPs and TIMPs might, therefore, contribute todegradation or deposition of the ECM [5, 6]. Inhibition ofMMP-mediated migration or invasion could thus provide ameans of preventing cancer metastasis.Terminalia is a genus of combretaceous plants widelydistributed in tropical and subtropical regions. In severalAsian countries, physicians have used the leaves, bark, andfruit of Terminalia catappa to treat dermatitis and pyresis.Terminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) contain flavonoidsand hydrolysable tannins, which have preventive effectson hepatoma and reduce hepatotoxicity. The antioxidative,hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and carcinogenesis-preventing effects of TCE could potentially provide ben-efits to human health [7\u20139]. The group\u2019s previous studyshowed that TCE can inhibit lung cancer metastasis in vivoand in vitro [9]. However, the effects of TCE on HCCinvasion and metastasis, and the underlying mechanismsof the antimetastatic effects, have yet to be evaluated. Thepresent study, therefore, investigated the potential inhibitoryeffects of TCE on hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7 cell)invasiveness, and the possible mechanisms of TCE-inducedantimetastatic effects.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Preparation of Terminalia catappa Leaves Extracts (TCE).Terminalia catappa leaves were purchased from local herbstores in Taichung and the TCE were prepared by aninitial condensation followed by lyophilization as describedpreviously [9]. Briefly, 100 g of air-dried leaves were boiled at70\u25e6C for 24 h with 500 mL of 50% ethanol. The extractionprocedure was repeated twice. Then, solvent was removedfrom the combined extract with a vacuum rotary evaporator.The filtrate was then lyophilized and stored at \u221220\u25e6C.Furthermore, the chemical profile of TCE was analyzed byusing high-pressure liquid chromatograms (HPLC) massspectrometer as described previously [9]. For subsequentexperiments, TCE powder was dissolved in 50% in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to achieve an indicated concentra-tion with the highest concentration of DMSO less than0.1%.2.2. Cell Culture and TCE Treatment. HCC (Huh7) cellsobtained from Food Industry Research and DevelopmentInstitute (Hsinchu, Taiwan) was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s mod-ified Eagle\u2019s medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,USA), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mLpenicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and 400 ng/mL hydro-cortisone. All cell cultures were maintained at 37\u25e6C n ahumidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For TCE treatment,appropriate amounts of stock solution of TCE were addedinto culture medium to achieve the indicated concentrationsand then incubated with cells for indicated time periods,whereas dimethyl sulfoxide solution without TCE was usedas blank reagent.2.3. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). For cellviability experiment, a microculture tetrazolium (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) col-orimetric assay was performed to determine the cytotoxi-city of TCE [10, 11]. Huh7 cells were seeded in 24-wellplates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well and treated with TCEat a concentration between 0\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL at 37\u25e6C for 24 h.After the exposure period, the media was removed, and cellswere washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and thenincubated with 20 \u03bcL MTT (5 mg/mL) (Sigma chemical Co.,St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The viable cell number per dishis directly proportional to the production of formazan, whichcan be measured spectrophotometrically at 563 nm followingsolubilization with isopropanol.2.4. In Vitro Wound Closure. Huh7 cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well)were plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratchingwith a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM mediumcontaining 0.5% FBS and treated with or without TCE (0,25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Cells werephotographed using a phase-contrast microscope (\u00d7100).2.5. Cell Invasion and Migration Assays. Cell invasion andmigration were assayed according to the methods describedby Yang et al. [12]. After a treatment with TCE (0, 25, 50,75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h, surviving cells were harvestedand seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John,MD, USA) at 104 cells/well in serum-free medium and thenincubated for 24 hours at 37\u25e6C. For invasion assay, 10 \u03bcLMatrigel (25 mg/50 mL; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) wasapplied to 8 \u03bcm pore size polycarbonate membrane filtersand the bottom chamber contained standard medium. Filterswere then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. Theinvaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stainedwith 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a lightmicroscope. The migration assay was carried out as describedin the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel [13].2.6. Determination of MMP-9 by Zymography. The activitiesof MMP-9 in conditional medium were measured by gelatinzymography protease assays as previously described [12].Briefly, collected media of an appropriate volume (adjustedby vital cell number) were prepared with SDS sample bufferwithout boiling or reduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gelswere washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubatedin reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM CaCl2and 0.01% NaN3) for 12 h at 37\u25e6C. Then gel was stained withCoomassie brilliant blue R-250.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3Cell viability (% of control) 2004060801000 25 50 75 100TCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)(a)02040608010012012 hr 24 hr100 \u03bcg/mL75 \u03bcg/mL50 \u03bcg/mL25 \u03bcg/mLControl\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217Number of migrated cells (% of control)0 hr12 hr24 hr0 25 50 75 100TCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)TCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)(b)Figure 1: Effect of TCE on cell viability and in vitro wound closure in Huh7 cells.

Preparation of Total Cell Lysates and Nuclear Fraction.For total cell lysates preparation, cells were rinsed with PBStwice and scraped with 0.2 mL of cold RIPA buffer containingprotease inhibitors cocktail, and then vortexed at 4\u25e6C for10 min. Cell lysates were subjected to a centrifugation of10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u25e6C, and the insoluble pellet wasdiscarded. Nuclear extracts were obtained using a modifica-tion of a previously described method [13]. Briefly, harvestedcells were scraped and lysed with buffer A (10 mM HEPES,10 mM KC1, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% NP40,1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride),followed by vortexing to shear the cytoplasmic membranesand nuclear pellets were collected by a centrifugation at3000 rpm for 30 s at 4\u25e6C. Nuclear proteins were extractedwith high-salt buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 25% glycerol,1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The proteinconcentration of total cell lysates and nuclear fraction weredetermined by Bradford assay [15].2.9. Western Blot Analysis. The cell lysates or nuclear extractswere separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferredonto a nitrocellulose membrane.

Blots were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidasegoat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Afterwards,signal was detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence(ECL) commercial kit (Amersham Biosciences) and relativephotographic density was quantitated by scanning the pho-tographic negatives on a gel documentation and analysissystem (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech Corporation,San Leandro, CA, USA).2.10. Transfection and MMP-9 Promoter-Driven LuciferaseAssays. Huh7 cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 \u00d7104 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates. After 24 hof incubation, pGL3-basic (vector) and MMP-9 promoterplasmid were cotransfected with a \u03b2-galactosidase expressionvector (pCH110) into cells using Turbofect (Fermentas,Carlsbad, CA). After 12 h of transfection, cells were treatedwith vehicle or TCE (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h.The cell lysates were harvested, and luciferase activity wasdetermined using a luciferase assay kit.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis (ChIP). Chro-matin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as des-cribed previously [14]. DNA immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-\u03baB and anti-AP-1 was purified and extracted usingphenol-chloroform. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzedby PCR or quantitative PCR by using specific primers.2.12. Statistical Analysis. Statistical significances of differencethroughout this study were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test(Sigma-Stat 2.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, USA). Adifference at P < 0.05 was considered to be statisticallysignificant and the experiments were repeated three times.3. Results3.1. Effects of TCE on Huh7 Cell Viability. Figure 1(a) displaysthe cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of TCE(0 \u03bcg/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL) on Huh7 cells. Results from MTTassay revealed that TCE did not influence Huh7 cell viabilityat all tested concentrations. A lower TCE concentration rangewas, thus, used for all subsequent experiments.3.2. Effects of TCE on Wound Closure, Invasion, and Migrationof Huh7 Cells In Vitro. Figure 1(b) displays the findings fromwound closure assay to evaluate the effects of TCE on Huh7cell migration, showing representative photographs of Huh7cells migrating into scratch wounds following treatment withTCE. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) demonstrate the effects of TCEon cell migration and invasion in Huh7 cells treated with0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL TCE for 16 h (cell migration)and 24 h (cell invasion). Cell migration and invasion assaysusing a Boyden chamber revealed that TCE induced markedreductions in the invasion and migration abilities of Huh7cells in a concentration-dependent manner.3.3. Effects of TCE on the Expression of MMP-9 and ItsEndogenous Inhibitor. The Huh7 cells were treated with TCE(0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h, and then subjectedto gelatin zymography to analyze MMP-9 activity. As shownin Figures 3(a)-3(b), TCE treatment reduced MMP-9 activityin a dose-dependent manner. Figure 3(c) shows Western blotanalysis of the expression of MMP-9 and its endogenousinhibitor TIMP-1. The MMP-9 and TIMP-1 protein levelswere adjusted using \u03b2-actin. Following TCE treatment,MMP-9 expression decreased significantly, whereas TIMP-1expression increased (Figure 3(d)).3.4. Effects of TCE on MMP-9 Transcription. To evaluate theinhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 expression in Huh7cells, Huh7 cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, and100 \u03bcg/mL TCE for 24 h, and then subjected to reverse trans-criptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-timePCR to analyze mRNA levels. After treatment with variousconcentrations of TCE, the levels of MMP-9 mRNA showedmarked decreases in a concentration-dependent manner(Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Promoter analysis using a luciferaseassay kit identified significant inhibition of the luciferaseactivities of MMP-9 (Figure 4(c)). These results indicate thatTCE regulates the expression of MMP-9, at least partially, ata transcriptional level.3.5.

Sequence analysis of the MMP-9 promoter revealed anumber of cis-acting regulatory elements that could poten-tially be involved in the regulation of MMP-9 expression,including NF-\u03baB and AP-1. Chromatin immunoprecipita-tion (ChIP) assay then investigated the involvement of thesetranscription factors in the TCE-induced transcriptionalinhibition of MMP-9 (Figure 5(a)). Results from quantitativereal-time PCR indicated that TCE significantly reduced thebinding of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 to the MMP-9 promoters(Figure 5(b)).To further investigate the involvement of AP-1 and NF-\u03baB in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 by TCE inHuh7 cells, the effects of TCE on nuclear translocationof NF-\u03baB, c-fos, and c-Jun were evaluated. Treatment ofHuh7 cells with 0, 25, and 100 \u03bcg/mL TCE reduced nucleartranslocation of NF-\u03baB, and phosphorylation of I\u03baB, c-Fos,and c-Jun (Figures 6(a) to 6(c)). These findings indicatedthat TCE might induce transcriptional inhibition of MMP-9 in Huh7 cells by suppressing NF-\u03baB and AP-1 nucleartranslocation and MMP-9 promoter binding activity.4. DiscussionHerbal products are used worldwide in the prevention andtreatment of various chronic diseases, and their potentialanticancer and antimetastatic effects are currently underinvestigation. Terminalia catappa leaf extracts exert a rangeof biological effects on cells, including antioxidant and hep-atoprotective activity on hepatocytes and liver mitochondria,and preventive activity against hepatocyte apoptosis [16\u201319].In previous studies, water extracts of TCE could effectivelyreduce carbon-tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced hepatotoxicityand bleomycin-induced genotoxicity of Chinese hamsterovary cells [20, 21]. Tang et al. reported that ethanol extractsof TCE contain higher active components than water extractsof TCE [8]. In an earlier study, the same group identified thatchloroform extracts of TCE induce hepatoprotective effectsthat might be related to the regulation of liver IL-6 geneexpression [22]. Different methods of extraction of TCE can,therefore, influence the physiological nature of the activecompound and modify its effects directly.As described in previous studies, the protective activitiesof TCE against liver mitochondrial damage induced by car-bon tetrachloride (CCl4) might be related to the inhibition ofIL-6 gene overexpression [20, 23]. Studies have also suggestedthat its protective effects might be related to the scavengingof reactive oxygen species (ROS) [20, 21, 24]. The groupsof Fan and Tang speculated that TCE might prevent DNAdamage and carcinogenesis by inhibiting ROS generationor reducing DNA adduct formation [19, 25]. In the studyof Wen et al., T. catappa L. hydrophilic extract (TCLW)inhibited MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 expressions at arange of concentrations and promoted the expression of typeI procollagen by inhibiting MMP-1, -3, and -9 activities.This afforded it antiaging activity and potential cosmeticuse [24]. Ko et al. also described that SC-CO2 extract ofTCE exhibited potent antimutagenicity and demonstratedhigher cytotoxicity against HCC cells than against normalliver cells. Therefore, TCE is a potent antioxidant and mightprovide a novel source of biomedicinal phytochemicals forcancer prevention [26]. However, constraints on the use ofherbal products for prevention of cancer metastasis have yetto be cleared, and the underlying biological mechanisms of10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinetheir activities have yet to be fully characterized. Our group\u2019sprevious studies identified that TCE induces antimetastaticeffects in lung cancer (A549, Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) andoral cancer cells (SCC-4) [5, 9]. The present study\u2019s resultsindicate that TCE also exerts inhibitory effects on HCC cellmetastasis through regulation of MMP-9. Morioka et al.reported that TCE has a potent short-term chemopreventiveeffect on biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and mightbe associated with inhibition of the development of aber-rant crypt foci (ACF) and beta-catenin-accumulated crypts(BCACs) [27]. It is, therefore, possible that other proteasesare involved in the antimetastatic effects of TCE on HCC.Further investigation is needed to confirm the involvementof other antimetastatic mechanisms, and changes in theexpression of proteases, in TCE-induced effects.Transcription of the MMP-9 gene is regulated byupstream sequences, including motifs corresponding to NF-\u03baB or AP-1 binding sites [6, 28, 29]. In the present study,TCE inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 to theMMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. The transcription nuclearfactors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 can promote tumorigenesis and arelinked to invasion and metastasis. In the study by Aggarwal,inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activities was effective in theprevention and treatment of cancer [30]. This result wassimilar to the group\u2019s previous finding that norcantharidin(NCTD) exerted inhibitory effects on metastasis in HCC cells[6]. Activation of NF-\u03baB occurs through the phosphorylationof I\u03baB\u03b1. This releases NF-\u03baB, which then translocates fromthe cytosol to the nucleus to regulate gene expression at atranscriptional level. In the present study, TCE treatmentresulted in inhibition of NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity,accompanied by inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, leadingto the downregulation of MMP-9.In conclusion, the present study\u2019s findings demonstratethat TCE exerts inhibitory effects on several critical stagesof metastasis, including cell invasion and migration, byregulating the activities of metastasis-associated proteasesand their natural inhibitors. Terminalia Catappa leaf extractsmight, therefore, have potential use in the developmentof preventive and treatment agents for cancer metastasis.Terminalia catappa leaf extracts inhibit NF-\u03baB and AP-1DNA binding activities effectively, resulting in the down-regulation of MMP-9 expression and the inhibition ofmetastasis (Figure 7). By targeting the signal transductionmediators and transcriptional factors involved in the TCEantimetastatic process in human hepatoma cells, it mightbe possible to develop specific mediators to inhibit cellmetastasis. Further in vivo analysis is needed to confirmthe effectiveness of TCE in the prevention or treatment ofhepatoma invasion or migration.AbbreviationsTCE: Terminalia catappa leaf extractsECM: Extracellular matrixMMP: Matrix metalloproteinaseTIMP: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseHCC: Hepatocellular carcinomaChIP: Chromatin immunoprecipitation.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by a Research Grant from ChungShan Medical University Hospital, Taiwan (CSH-2012-C-006).References[1] T.
