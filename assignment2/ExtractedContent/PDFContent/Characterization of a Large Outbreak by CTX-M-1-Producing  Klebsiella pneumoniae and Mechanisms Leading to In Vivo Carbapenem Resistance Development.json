The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline,whereas resistance to the \ufffd-lactam\u2013\ufffd-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involvedwas CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 aswell as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could betransferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenemresistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 \ufffdg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem,respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysisof the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that theformer expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either ofthem. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by theinterruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a largeoutbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in theliterature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiplespecies. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance developmentin CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.Since plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum \ufffd-lactamases(ESBLs) were first detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolatein 1983 in Germany (22), they have been increasingly reportedworldwide (5). The classical ESBLs are those derived from thebroad-spectrum enzymes TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 by theacquisition of specific point mutations which expand theirspectrum of hydrolysis to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreo-nam (7). Nevertheless, the most widespread plasmid-mediatedESBLs nowadays are the CTX-M enzymes, which are directlyderived from the chromosomal \ufffd-lactamases of several speciesof the genus Kluyvera (3). Five different groups of CTX-Mscontaining a total of over 30 different variants have been de-scribed so far, with CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-25 being the first reported representatives.CTX-M-1 (also known as MEN-1) was the first reported variant,detected from an Escherichia coli strain in 1989 in Germany (2),but CTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-15 are themost widespread enzymes (3).The production of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae confers re-sistance to all penicillins and cephalosporins (with the excep-tion of cephamycins), with the organism generally remainingsusceptible only to \ufffd-lactam\u2013\ufffd-lactamase inhibitor combina-tions, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the carbapenems,which are frequently the only therapeutic options available fortreatment of hospital-acquired severe infections caused bythese microorganisms (25). Coresistance to non-\ufffd-lactam an-tibiotics is also frequent, either by the cotransfer of the resis-tance determinants in the same genetic elements (such as ami-noglycoside resistance) or simply by the coselection of bothresistance mechanisms, as occurs with fluoroquinolones (32).In this work we characterized a large outbreak caused by aCTX-M-1-producing multiresistant K. pneumoniae strain in aSpanish intensive care unit (ICU). Although CTX-M-1 was thefirst CTX-M described, over 15 years ago, and has been de-tected in various countries, including at least Germany andFrance (14), Italy (31), and recently, in a single E. coli isolatefrom cattle milk, Spain (6), and in several species, including E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacteramalonaticus (28), reports of CTX-M-1-producing K. pneu-moniae strains have not yet been published, and this is the firstreport of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobac-* Corresponding author.

Furthermore, in this work we documentand characterize for the first time in vivo resistance develop-ment to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteria-ceae due to the selection of mutations leading to the lack ofexpression of porins.MATERIALS AND METHODSClinical strains and antibiotic susceptibility testing. All ESBL-producingEnterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to the adult ICU (30 bedsdivided in three contiguous units) from Hospital Son Dureta (900 beds;reference public hospital from the Island of Mallorca, Spain) have beenprospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak causedby multiresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was detected. Bacterialidentification and initial susceptibility testing were performed with theWIDER semiautomatic system (Francisco Soria Melguizo, Madrid, Spain)(8). Double-disk synergy testing (DDST) for the detection of ESBL produc-tion was performed using amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,cefepime, and aztreonam disks that were applied 30 and/or 20 mm apart (20).Additionally, the MICs of several antibiotics were determined for selectedisolates by using Etest strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), following themanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. For the screening of intestinal coloniza-tion by the epidemic K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strain, from May toDecember 2005, rectal swabs, collected weekly, were plated on MacConkeyagar supplemented with 2 \ufffdg/ml of cefotaxime and 10 \ufffdg/ml of gentamicin.The screening for intestinal colonization was carried out for all patients withpositive clinical samples as well as those patients present in the same unit atthe time of isolation. For those patients, weekly rectal swabs were obtaineduntil discharge or until three consecutive negative colonization results.Molecular strain typing. The clonal relationship between the different isolateswas studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Agarose plugs contain-ing total bacterial DNA were prepared as described elsewhere (21). Plugs werethen digested with XbaI and loaded into a 1% Megabase agarose (Bio-Rad, LaJolla, Calif.) gel. DNA separation was performed in a CHEF-DRIII apparatus(Bio-Rad, La Jolla, Calif.) under the following conditions: 6 V/cm2 for 20 h at14\u00b0C, with initial and final pulse times of 2 s and 35 s, respectively. The resultswere interpreted following the criteria of Tenover et al. (37).Characterization of \ufffd-lactamases and their genes. The pIs of the \ufffd-lactamaseswere determined by isoelectric focusing (IEF), applying the supernatants ofcrude sonic cell extracts to Phast gels (Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with apH gradient of 3 to 9 in a Phast system (Pharmacia). \ufffd-Lactamases with knownpI values (TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-4, TEM-3, SHV-1, CTX-M-10, and CTX-M-1)were included as controls. Gels were stained with 500 \ufffdg/ml of nitrocefin (Oxoid)to identify the bands corresponding to \ufffd-lactamases. PCRs for genes encodingTEM, SHV, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-10 \ufffd-lactamases were performed usingprimers and conditions described previously (10). Primers CTX-MF (5\ufffd-GACTATTCATGTTGTTGTTATTTC-3\ufffd) and CTX-MR (5\ufffd-TTACAAACCGTTGGTGACG-3\ufffd) were used for the amplification of a 923-bp DNA fragment (nucle-otides \ufffd48 to the stop codon) from the genes encoding CTX-M-1 or closelyrelated ESBLs. Taq Gold polymerase (PE-Applied Biosystems) was used forPCR amplification under the following conditions: 12 min at 94\u00b0C, 35 cycles ofamplification (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 58\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C), and a finalextension step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Two independent PCR products were se-quenced on both strands, using the BigDye terminator kit (PE-Applied Biosys-tems) for performing the sequencing reactions, which were analyzed with theABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (PE-Applied Biosystems).Conjugation, transformation, and plasmid analysis. Conjugation experimentswere performed by filter mating using a rifampin-resistant mutant of E. coli strainHB101 as the recipient in 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, triparenteral crossings usingthe same recipient and E. coli HB101(pRK2013) as a mobilization helper (12) ina 1:1:1 ratio were attempted. Transconjugants were selected in Luria-Bertani(LB) agar plates containing 100 \ufffdg/ml of rifampin and 2 \ufffdg/ml of cefotaxime. Fortransformation experiments, plasmid DNAs from the ESBL-producing K. pneu-moniae isolates obtained using the QIAGEN plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN,Hilden, Germany) were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain madecompetent by CaCl2 treatment. Transformants were selected in LB agar platescontaining 50 \ufffdg/ml of ampicillin. Transconjugants or transformants werechecked by DDST followed by IEF, PCR amplification of the appropriate ESBL-encoding gene, and Etest testing of susceptibility to all \ufffd-lactams and non-\ufffd-lactams (to determine the resistance determinants cotransferred with the ESBL)defined above. For the estimation of the plasmid size, plasmid DNA obtainedfrom one of the transformants was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and EcoRI plusBamHI, and the restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 1%agarose gel. The sizes of the different fragments were estimated by plottingagainst the standard curve obtained with the Superladder-Mid1 100-bp laddermolecular weight markers (Gensura) and the lambda HindIII digest (NewEngland Biolabs).Isolation and analysis of OMP. Cell envelopes were isolated from K. pneu-moniae strains grown in LB medium by centrifugation at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at4\u00b0C after French press cell lysis. Outer membrane proteins (OMP) were isolatedas sodium lauryl sarcosynate-insoluble material (15). Electrophoretic analysis ofOMP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed with 11% acrylamide\u20130.35% bisacrylamide\u20130.1% SDS byusing Laemmli\u2019s buffers (24) and Coomassie blue staining. Samples were boiledfor 5 min in sample buffer before electrophoresis. Western blot analysis ofSDS-PAGE-separated OMP was carried out with the buffers and conditionsdescribed by Towbin et al. (38), Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), rabbitantiserum raised against purified OmpK36 porin (1), and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma). Enzyme was detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate toluidinium\u2013nitroblue tetrazolium. K. pneumoniaeLB1, which expresses only one porin, was used as a control (26).PCR amplification of porin genes. The primers used to amplify the OmpK36porin gene were OmpK36-0 (5\ufffd AAGCTTGTTGGATTATTCTGC-3\ufffd) andOmpK36-end (5\ufffd-CAAGCTTAGAACTGGTAAACC-3\ufffd). They anneal specifi-cally to sequences of ompK36 located 116 bp upstream and 1,084 bp downstreamof the ompK36 start codon (26), respectively. PCR amplifications were per-formed in a Thermoline Amplitron 1 thermal cycler by using Taq polymerase(Pharmacia) with 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 1min at 72\u00b0C). Amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis andethidium bromide staining and sequenced as described above.RESULTSAll ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from pa-tients admitted to an adult ICU were prospectively docu-mented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak of multi-resistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infection was detected.The incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolatedduring this period is shown in Fig. 1A. As can be observed, adramatic increase in the number of patients infected by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was documented during 2005, with atotal of 52 cases, in contrast to the 1 case documented in either2003 or 2004 and the 0 cases documented in 2002. Figure 1Bshows the distribution of new cases on a monthly basis during2005, clearly showing that the epidemic started in Februaryand reached its peak during May and June, with 13 and 12 newcases, respectively. From then on, the incidence of new caseson a monthly basis fluctuated from zero to six new cases permonth. Since five new cases were detected in December, theoutbreak still cannot be considered to have been controlled atthe end of the year. In May 2005, in addition to measures forthe contact isolation of infected patients, a protocol for routinedetection and isolation of patients with intestinal colonizationwas established; rectal swabs were collected weekly and platedin selective media, and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae wasidentified as described in Materials and Methods. The out-break had a dramatic impact on the prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in the ICU, reaching 60.3% of pa-tients infected (not including patients with only intestinalcolonization) by K. pneumoniae during 2005, in contrast to 0%,4.5%, and 3.8% for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004, respec-tively.All but one of the K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from the52 patients had the same pattern of multiresistance as initiallydocumented with the WIDER microdilution-based semiauto-matic system for bacterial identification and susceptibility test-ing (8), showing, in addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance2832 MENA ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.to penicillins and cephalosporins, cross-resistance to cipro-floxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole, and tetracycline. All isolates with this pattern of multi-resistance were uniformly susceptible, when first recovered(see below), only to amikacin and carbapenems. The singleisolate with a different resistance pattern was ciprofloxacinsusceptible and amikacin resistant.All ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (one randomlyselected isolate from each of the 52 patients) were confirmedto belong to a single epidemic, multiresistant clone, with theexception of that isolate with a different resistance pattern, byPFGE. Furthermore, the single isolate from 2003 was found tobe nonrelated to the epidemic clone by PFGE, but the isolatefrom 2004 (detected in November, 3 months before the initi-ation of the outbreak) was found to be highly related to theepidemic clone, as shown in Fig. 2.The sources of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae epi-demic clone for the 51 ICU patients during the 2005 outbreakare shown in Table 1. In 44 (86.3%) of the patients the epi-demic clone was isolated from clinical samples, most fre-quently from the respiratory tract (30 patients; 68.2%),whereas in 7 (13.7%) of them it was detected only in intestinalcolonization studies. Intestinal colonization studies were per-formed for 34 of the 44 infected patients (77.3%), with apositive result obtained for 32 (94.1%), thus showing that in-testinal colonization occurs in most infected patients.To characterize the ESBL produced by the epidemic K.pneumoniae clone, IEF was performed with three random iso-lates, revealing in all cases the presence of a \ufffd-lactamase bandwith a pI of \ufffd8.4 cofocusing with the CTX-M-1 control. PCRamplification was found to be positive only when using theprimers for the gene encoding CTX-M-1 or related enzymesand sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presenceof blaCTX-M-1. As could be expected, the single ESBL-produc-ing K. pneumoniae isolate from 2004 (clonally related to the2005 outbreak isolates) also produced CTX-M-1. On the otherFIG. 1. A.

Nevertheless, the plasmidlocation of blaCTX-M-1was demonstrated by transformation ex-periments. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli, andthree transformants growing on LB agar plates containing 50\ufffdg/ml of ampicillin were first checked by DDST followed byIEF, which revealed the presence of a single \ufffd-lactamase bandwith a pI of \ufffd8.4, and then by PCR amplification with thespecific primers. The size of the plasmid determined by theanalysis of the EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments wasestimated to be approximately 50 kb.In two of the patients infected by the epidemic multiresistantK. pneumoniae clone, development of carbapenem (imipenem,meropenem, and ertapenem) resistance was documented. Forone of them, the carbapenem-resistant isolate was recoveredfrom respiratory samples after treatment with imipenem, andfor the other the isolate was recovered from urine after treat-ment with meropenem. In both patients, the carbapenem-re-sistant isolates were additionally detected in the intestinal col-onization studies. PFGE macrorestriction patterns of the twocarbapenem-resistant isolates were found to be identical tothose of the carbapenem-susceptible isolates, and the acquisi-tion of additional \ufffd-lactamases was ruled out by IEF.Table 2 shows the MICs (determined by Etest) of several\ufffd-lactam and non-\ufffd-lactam antibiotics for five representativeisolates of the epidemic clone recovered from different pa-tients and during different periods and for the two carbap-enem-resistant isolates. The MICs in both resistant isolateswere slightly higher for ertapenem (MIC of \ufffd32 \ufffdg/ml), fol-lowed by meropenem (MIC of 16 \ufffdg/ml) and imipenem (MICof 8 to 12 \ufffdg/ml). The MICs for the E. coli transformantharboring the blaCTX-M-1-carrying plasmid (pAMR-1) are alsoshown in Table 2. As can be observed, in addition to theESBL-mediated resistance pattern, aminoglycoside (gentami-cin and tobramycin) resistance was cotransferred in the sameplasmid. As for carbapenems, pAMR-1 significantly raised theMICs for E. coli XL1-Blue of ertapenem (from 0.012 to 0.125\ufffdg/ml) and, to a lesser extent, of meropenem (from 0.016 to0.047 \ufffdg/ml) but not of imipenem (0.38 \ufffdg/ml) (harboring or notpAMR-1). Nevertheless, the MICs of the three carbapenemsremained far below the resistance breakpoints.In order to investigate whether carbapenem resistance wascaused by alterations of the outer membrane permeability, weanalyzed the outer membrane proteins of susceptible and re-sistant pairs of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from two pa-tients. SDS-PAGE analysis of the OMP of K. pneumoniaegrown in LB showed only two major proteins, of about 33 and36 kDa, in the 31- to 45-kDa range for the carbapenem-sus-ceptible isolates, corresponding to OmpA and OmpK36, re-spectively. On the other hand, the 36-kDa protein was absentin both carbapenem-resistant isolates (Fig. 3A). The porinnature of the 36-kDa protein present in the carbapenem-sus-ceptible isolates and absent in the resistant ones was confirmedby Western blot analysis using specific antibodies (Fig. 3B).The specific antiserum reacted with the band present in thesusceptible isolates and the control K. pneumoniae LB1 butfailed to detect the protein in the resistant isolates.To investigate the cause of the porin deficiency observed inthe carbapenem-resistant isolates, we amplified the entireFIG. 2.

PCR amplification of thegenomic DNA from the susceptible isolates yielded an ampli-con with the expected size, 1,200 bp (data not shown). On theother hand, PCR amplification of the ompK36 gene in theresistant isolate KPCR1 consistently failed, and the ampliconobtained with the genomic DNA from the resistant strainKPCR2 was 800 bp larger than expected (data not shown).Sequencing of this amplicon revealed that the size increase wasdue the presence of the insertion sequence IS26 in the ompK36coding region.DISCUSSIONThe dissemination of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae inthe hospital setting is a problem with major therapeutic andepidemiological consequences, particularly when it affectswards caring for critically ill patients such as the ICU. Multipleoutbreaks of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have indeedbeen reported over the past two decades, and certainly K.pneumoniae has been the most frequently involved organism(33, 35, 36). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this isthe first report of a large outbreak by CTX-M-1-producingEnterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented de-scription in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, de-spite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiplespecies, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, and C.amalonaticus. A hospital outbreak due to a K. pneumoniaestrain producing an ESBL related to CTX-M-1 was describedin Japan (23), but since the gene encoding the ESBL was notsequenced and CTX-M-1 has not been reported in the FarEast, it is more likely that the enzyme involved was actually oneof its close relatives, either CTX-M-3 or CTX-M-15, both ofwhich were already found in Japanese hospitals (3).CTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M.15 are themost widespread CTX-M enzymes (3). As for Spanish hospi-tals, most CTX-M ESBLs found in a nationwide study wereFIG. 3. SDS-PAGE (A) and Western blotting with anti-OmpK36serum (B) of OMP from K. pneumoniae LB1 (lane 1), the carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae clinical isolates (lanes 2 and 3), and theirrespective in vivo-selected carbapenem mutants (lanes 4 and 5).

At this stage, the onlypublished documentation of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacte-riaceae in Spain is the report of a single E. coli isolate detectedin cattle milk (6).Carbapenems are frequently the only therapeutic optionsavailable for treatment of hospital-acquired severe infectionscaused by multiresistant ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceaesuch as the strain described in this work. Nevertheless, univer-sal susceptibility to these last-line antimicrobials in Enterobac-teriaceae is no longer guaranteed. Indeed, several carbapen-emases have been described as occurring in Enterobacteriaceae,including representatives from classes A, such as the highlydisseminated KPC enzymes; B, such as IMP or VIM metallo-\ufffd-lactamases; or D, such as OXA-48 (29, 34, 39). Additionally,carbapenem resistance development in strains producingESBLs or AmpC \ufffd-lactamases due to the selection of mutantswith reduced permeability to these antimicrobials is being in-creasingly reported (4, 9). Previous work has shown that theexpression of both major K. pneumoniae porins, OmpK35 andOmpK36, plays a role in the susceptibility to carbapenem an-tibiotics and that mutants lacking expression of both outermembrane proteins show reduced susceptibility to these anti-microbials, especially when combined with AmpC enzymes andsome class A ESBLs (11, 13, 19, 27). Nevertheless, in this workwe document and characterize for the first time the develop-ment of in vivo resistance to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-pro-ducing Enterobacteriaceae due to the selection of mutationsleading to the lack of porin expression. As frequently occurs inclinical ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (18), the epi-demic strain described in this work did not express OmpK35,favoring carbapenem resistance development through the in-activation of OmpK36. Inactivation of OmpK36 in one of thestrains was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption ofthe coding sequence by an insertion sequence, as has beenpreviously reported for other clinical strains (17). As for thesecond carbapenem-resistant isolate, the failure of ompK36amplification could suggest that the mechanism for inactiva-tion was either a deletion of part or the complete codingsequence or its interruption by an insertion sequence too largeto be amplified by conventional PCR.Overall, CTX-M-1-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from 2of the 44 infected patients (4.5%) developed carbapenem re-sistance in clinical samples. Nevertheless, both patients hadintestinal colonization by the carbapenem-resistant isolatewhen it was detected in the clinical samples, which could sug-gest that resistance development may have taken place in theintestines of the colonized patients. Since the development ofcarbapenem resistance was not systematically explored in theintestinal colonization studies, we may indeed be underesti-mating the magnitude of the potential problem of carbapenemresistance development in colonized patients as a source ofcarbapenem-resistant isolates.In summary, we have described a large outbreak due to amultiresistant CTX-M-1-producing and OmpK35-deficient K.pneumoniae strain in an ICU and have characterized the mech-anisms leading to in vivo carbapenem resistance developmentthrough the inactivation of OmpK36 in two of the infectedpatients.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe are grateful to Enrique Ruiz de Gopegui for collecting thedata on the prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infec-tions in the ICU.This work was partially supported by the \u201cRed Espan\u0303ola de Inves-tigacio\u0301n en Patolog\u0131\u0301a Infecciosa\u201d (C03-014) and grant PI040339 fromthe Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias from the Ministerio deSanidad and grant SAF2005-01466 from the Ministerio de Educacio\u0301ny Ciencia of Spain.REFERENCES1.
