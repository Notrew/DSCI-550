Mesenchymal cells including microvascularmural cells (pericytes) are major progenitors of scar-forming my-ofibroblasts in kidney and other organs. Here we show pericytes inhealthy kidneys have active WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling responsesthat are markedly up-regulated following kidney injury. Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), a ligand for the WNT coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP-5 and LRP-6) and an inhibitor of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, effectively inhibitspericyte activation, detachment, and transition to myofibroblasts invivo in response to kidney injury, resulting in attenuated fibrogen-esis, capillary rarefaction, and inflammation. DKK-1 blocks activa-tion and proliferation of established myofibroblasts in vitro andblocks pericyte proliferation to PDGF, pericyte migration, gene ac-tivation, and cytoskeletal reorganization to TGF-\u03b2 or connectivetissue growth factor. These effects are largely independent ofinhibition of downstream \u03b2-catenin signaling. DKK-1 acts predom-inantly by inhibiting PDGF-, TGF-\u03b2\u2013, and connective tissue growthfactor-activatedMAPK and JNK signaling cascades, acting via LRP-6with associated WNT ligand. Biochemically, LRP-6 interacts closelywith PDGF receptor \u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1 at the cell membrane,suggesting that it may have roles in pathways other than WNT/\u03b2-catenin. In summary, DKK-1 blocks many of the changes inpericytes required for myofibroblast transition and attenuates estab-lished myofibroblast proliferation/activation by mechanisms de-pendent on LRP-6 and WNT ligands but not the downstream\u03b2-catenin pathway.Fibrosis of the internal organs, resulting from subclinical injuryto the organ over a period of time or from acute severe injuryor inflammation, is a major global health problem. All organs maybe affected by fibrosis, which matures into microscopic or mac-roscopic scarring within the tissue parenchyma. At present thereare few therapies that specifically target the process of fibro-genesis, despite increasing evidence suggesting that fibrogenesisper se provokes further decline in organ function, inflammation,and tissue ischemia (1). In addition, myofibroblasts themselvesare inflammatory cells that generate cytokines, chemokines, andradicals that promote injury. Myofibroblasts appear as a result ofa transition from pericytes, cells that normally nurse, maintain,and regulate the microvasculature (2, 3). The transition frompericytes to myofibroblasts results in an unstable microvascula-ture leading to aberrant angiogenesis or rarefaction (3). Thesemicrovascular changes ultimately provoke tissue ischemia. There-fore, the myofibroblast and its transition from resident pericyte orfibroblast is a major new target for therapeutics to counter thedeleterious consequences of tissue injury.Recently, SNPs in LRP-6, a transmembrane coreceptor forWNTs that binds to Frizzled (Frz) receptors and thereby tothe WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade, have been identified asindependent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. However,the mechanisms still are obscure (4, 5).The WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is a major regulator ofcell function both in embryonic development and in adults. Bothelevated and attenuated levels of signaling that fall outside thenormal homeostatic range of WNT signaling are linked to ab-normal embryonic development and to diverse disease states (6).Increasing evidence indicates that WNT signaling plays criticalroles in tissue regeneration and immune responses to injury andinfection (7). However, the signaling cascade and the cellularresponses are complex and context specific (8).Previous studies have highlighted the importance of WNT/\u03b2-catenin in kidney regeneration (9), and studies of chronic dis-ease of the kidney glomerulus and liver sinusoids suggest thatpersistent activation ofWNT/\u03b2-catenin is deleterious (10), but therole of WNT signaling in myofibroblasts and their precursors,pericytes of the kidney capillaries, was not studied (2). Here weexplore the consequences of reactivating WNT/\u03b2-catenin signal-ing in pericytes and myofibroblasts after kidney injury.Results and DiscussionWnt/\u03b2-Catenin Pathway Is Up-Regulated in Myofibroblasts in KidneyDisease. To explore the extent of the activation of the canonicalWNT pathway in cells of the normal kidney, we studied twodistinct lines of mice that are transgenic for reporters of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Axin2+/lacz generates \u03b2-gal in cells expressingthe endogenous WNT/\u03b2-catenin target gene, Axin2. (Fig. 1A)(11). TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr is a recently validated transgenic lineof mice reporting \u03b2-catenin activity by nuclear GFP expression. Itexhibits enhanced sensitivity and specificity over previous re-porters of \u03b2-catenin nuclear activity (Fig. 1A) (12). In normalkidneys of Axin2+/lacz mice there is extensive WNT/\u03b2-cateninsignaling in the papilla, and there are more restricted responsesin the normal medulla and kidney cortex, as we have demon-strated previously (Fig. S1A) (9). Among the cells expressinglacZ were podocytes, vascular smooth muscle of arterioles, andsome pericytes (Fig. 1 B\u2013D and Fig. S1 A and B). In response toinjury initiated by obstructing urine flow from the kidney (theunilateral ureteric obstruction [UUO] model), there was markedincrease in lacZ staining in the scar-forming cells known as\u201cmyofibroblasts\u201d that derive from pericytes (Fig. 1 B\u2013D).

In normalkidney, \u03b2-catenin responses were more extensive than previouslyappreciated. We have shown previously that in normal kidney,proximal and distal epithelium exhibits little endogenous WNT/\u03b2-catenin reporter activity (9). In contrast, in TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTrmice there was evidence of WNT reporter activity in many of thesecells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1 C\u2013G). However, like the Axin2+/lacz re-porter, a minority of pericytes showed active signaling in normalkidney. Following kidney injury, WNT/\u03b2-catenin reporter activityincreased in epithelial cell compartments, but there was a muchgreater increase in the pericyte/myofibroblast population of cells(Fig. 1 E\u2013G and Fig. S1C).Kidney Myofibroblasts Up-Regulate Wnt Pathway Genes and WntReporter Activity. To explore further the activation of the WNTpathway in kidney myofibroblasts, we purified nonactivated peri-cytes (normal kidney), activated pericytes (from day 2 afterUUO), and myofibroblasts transitioned from pericytes (from days5, 7, and 10 after UUO) by flow cytometric sorting of single-celldigests from kidneys of the Coll-GFPTr reporter mouse, whichspecifically expresses GFP in these cells (13). Purified cells showedmarked up-regulation of pericyte genes, including P75 NGFR(Ngfr) (Fig. S2A), and at baseline expressed detectable levels ofNG2 (Cspg4) and PDGFR\u03b2 (Pdgfrb) that were modestly up-reg-ulated over time postinjury (Fig. S2D, Table S1). We found pro-totypical profibrotic genes expressed in normal kidney and up-regulated over time postinjury in our disease model, includingCol1a1, Tgfb1, Ctgf, and Fgf2. We also observed up-regulation ofthe phosphatonin Fgf23, which has been implicated in the path-ogenesis of cardiovascular disease (Fig. S2A). WNT ligands, in-cluding Wnt2, 3, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 10a, were up-regulated. Pericytesalso express cell-surface receptors (Fzd) and coreceptors (Lrp5,Lrp6) forWNT responsiveness (Fig. S2B). As the course of kidneydisease progressed, there was a modest up-regulation of theDickkopf-related protein (DKK) family of mRNAs known to in-hibit canonical WNT signaling via direct binding to the LRP-5 andLRP-6 coreceptors (Fig. S2C). Other WNT downstream targetgenes, including sFLT1 and WISP1, which play important roles innoncanonical and canonical WNT signaling pathways, re-spectively, also were up-regulated, consistent with activatedWNT/\u03b2-catenin and also noncanonical WNT pathways (Fig. S2C).DKK-1 Triggers G1 Cell-Cycle Arrest and Down-Regulates Activation inMyofibroblasts. To test the function of WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathwayactivation in myofibroblasts, we generated primary myofibroblastcultures from Coll-GFPTr mice that had kidney fibrosis (13).Myofibroblasts also expressed WNT ligands and receptors (Fig.S3A). DKK-1 has been reported to inhibit the WNT/\u03b2-cateninpathway by binding to LRP-5 or LRP-6. We cloned Dkk1 andexpressed soluble DKK-1 or the DKK-1-GFP fusion protein(Fig. S3B) in HEK293 cells. Soluble DKK-1-GFP binding tounlabeled cell lines was markedly enhanced by overexpression ofLRP-5 or LRP-6 (Fig. S3C), and DKK-1-GFP readily bound tothe surface of cultured myofibroblasts without the requirementfor receptor overexpression (Fig. S3D), indicating high receptordensity for DKK-1 on myofibroblasts. DKK-1 protein specificallyblocked entry of myofibroblasts into the cell cycle induced byserum at the G1 checkpoint (Fig. 2 A\u2013F and Fig. S3E), resultingin inability to proliferate (Fig. 2B).To understand the mechanisms better, we tested the effect ofDKK-1 on the steady-state level of \u03b2-catenin protein. Cytosolicand nuclear \u03b2-catenin increased 1 h and 16 h after serum acti-vation, an effect decreased by DKK-1 at 16 h (Fig. 2G), con-firming DKK-1 inhibits WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling but suggestingearly DKK-1 responses may occur independent of regulation of\u03b2-catenin protein (Fig. 2G). Transcripts for \u03b1SMA (Acta2), amarker of myofibroblast activation, were increased by serum at24 h, and DKK-1 significantly reduced this activation (Fig. 2H),suggesting that DKK-1 may regulate activation also.Systemic Delivery of DKK-1 Inhibits Myofibroblast Expansion andFibrosis. Next we tested whether DKK-1 inhibited pericytes andmyofibroblasts in vivo. DKK-1 was delivered systemically using anFig. 1.

In preventativestudies using the UUO model, DKK-1 profoundly inhibited peri-cyte expansion, proliferation, and transition to myofibroblasts (Fig.3 C\u2013I), resulting in reduced fibrosis (Fig. S4). The inhibition onday 4 after UUO was associated with a marked reduction ininflammation (Fig. 3J) and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A and B).Moreover, expression of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin reporters in kidneymyofibroblasts was reduced, particularly at the earlier time points(Fig 3K). These studies were extended to day 10 after UUO in-jury, and there was a substantial reduction in organ fibrosis andcollagen transcripts (Fig. 3 L\u2013M).To study this effect in more detail, we performed a reversalstudy in which DKK-1 was delivered after disease onset, and fi-brosis extent was assessed 10 d after UUO (Fig. 3 N\u2013P). Myofi-broblast accumulation, proliferation, deposition of interstitialfibrosis, and rarefaction of the capillaries were inhibited. Fur-thermore, as in the preventative studies, DKK-1 inhibited in-flammation and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A\u2013C). Because recentevidence indicates that myofibroblasts in kidney arise from peri-cyte precursors which detach from peritubular capillaries in re-sponse to injury (2), we examined the effect of DKK-1 on pericyteprecursor detachment, spreading, and migration in Coll-GFPTrreporter mice. DKK-1 inhibited pericyte detachment from capil-laries at early time points in this model (Fig. 3Q).We tested whether DKK-1 could inhibit disease in a secondmodel of inflammation and fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury(U-IRI) of a single (unilateral) kidney, a recognized model ofchronic kidney disease following acute kidney injury (9). Weperformed a reversal study in this model and characterized theextent of scarring in the kidney 10 d after the initial U-IRI. Cir-culating DKK-1 inhibited myofibroblast accumulation, inflamma-tion, and interstitial fibrosis and reduced epithelial injury (Fig. S4E\u2013K) sufficiently to reverse existent fibrosis (Fig. S4L).DKK-1 Blocks PDGF-Stimulated Proliferation of Kidney Pericytes by anLRP-6, P42/P44 MAPK-Dependent Mechanism. To study the mecha-nism of action of DKK-1, we tested its effects on primary kidneypericyte cultures, the precursors of myofibroblasts (2, 13). PDGFand TGF-\u03b2 signaling in pericytes are important factors in thedetachment of pericytes from capillaries and their transition tomyofibroblasts (3, 14) and as such are important factors indriving fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and itshomolog CCN1 (Cyr61) also have been implicated in fibrosis andwound healing (15). Pericytes were stimulated by PDGF-BB toenter the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), but other profibrogenic growth fac-tors had no effect. Unexpectedly, exogenous addition of WNT3adid not stimulate proliferation. DKK-1 markedly attenuatedPDGF-BB\u2013stimulated proliferation (Fig. 4B). PDGF stimulationdown-regulated transcripts for the activation markers CTGF,\u03b1SMA, and collagen I\u03b1 (1), and DKK-1 further down-regulatedthose transcripts (Fig. 4C), suggesting that DKK-1 therefore mayenhance certain PDGF-mediated transcriptional events. None ofthe factors applied to pericytes affected viability (Fig. 4D).In keeping with a link between PDGF signaling and the WNTpathway in pericyte proliferation, PDGF regulates a number ofWNT ligands, including up-regulating Wnt2 and 5a and down-regulating Wnt7a, 10a, and 16 (Fig. 4E). However, inconsistentwith such a link, exogenous WNT3a had no stimulatory effect onproliferation (Fig. 4A). Because DKK-1 acts via LRP-5 andLRP-6, and because PDGF regulates WNT transcripts (Fig. 4E),we expected DKK-1 to block the endogenous WNT/\u03b2-cateninFig. 3.

Binding of WNT ligands to Fzd receptors and LRP-6coreceptors leads to activation and phosphorylation of LRP-6(pLRP-6). Surprisingly therefore, PDGF-BB alone stimulatespLRP-6 (Fig. 4F), and DKK-1 initially augments pLRP-6 mod-estly and inhibits it only at later time points (Fig. 4F and Fig. S5A\u2013C), indicating that PDGF may coactivate the WNT/\u03b2-cateninpathway and that DKK-1 regulates this coactivation. To test thispossibility, we assessed whether PDGF-BB regulates the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway in pericytes cultured from the \u03b2-catenin re-porter mouse (TCF/Lef:H2B-GFPTr) (Fig. 4G). After 16 h withPDGF, nuclear \u03b2-catenin activity was increased significantly.This increase was inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4G), although theextent of \u03b2-catenin activation was much lower than the extent ofcells triggered into the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), a finding that isconsistent with the possibility that DKK-1 inhibits proliferationby a \u03b2-catenin\u2013independent pathway.We therefore explored signaling pathways activated by PDGF-BB but inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D). PDGF-BBstimulates the P42/P44 MAPK and the JNK signaling pathways.DKK-1 inhibits both these responses. PDGF-BB activates the P38MAPK pathway, but DKK-1 enhances this response, perhapsexplaining why DKK-1 can enhance PDGF-mediated transcrip-tion (Fig. 4C). As expected, PDGF-BB enhances cyclin D1 ex-pression (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D), an effect inhibited by DKK-1.Although WNT3a alone had no apparent impact on cell prolif-eration (Fig. 4A), it nevertheless stimulated the activation ofLRP-6 and accumulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. S5E), providing ev-idence that LRP-6 activation by PDGF-BB results in distinctsignaling vs. activation by WNT3a.Because DKK-1 specifically inhibits PDGF-stimulated P42/P44 MAPK and JNK activation (Fig. 4H), the relative impor-tance of these pathways was tested using specific inhibitors. TheP42/P44 inhibitor U0126 completely replaced DKK-1 function inPDGF-BB\u2013stimulated pericyte proliferation (Fig. 4I), whereasthe JNK inhibitor SP600125 had no impact. Because there wasno apparent linkage between the PDGF-BB\u2013mediated activationof the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and its capacity tostimulate proliferation, we tested whether the WNT/\u03b2-cateninpathway is necessary for PDGF-mediated proliferation usinga small-molecule inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin, XAV939 (a Tankyraseinhibitor). Strikingly, XAV939 had no effect (Fig. 4I). To con-firm this finding, cultured pericytes from kidneys homozygous forthe floxed alleles of \u03b2-catenin (Ctnnb1fl/fl) underwent recombi-nation in vitro by transduction with Lenti-Cre virus, and Lenti-GFP virus was used as a control that does not catalyze recom-bination. One hundred percent of pericytes were transduced byGFP expression, and \u03b2-catenin protein was lost 48 h after trans-duction with Lenti-Cre (Fig. S6). Pericytes lacking \u03b2-cateninresponded to PDGF and its inhibition by DKK-1 similarly topericytes with \u03b2-catenin (Fig. 4J), confirming that PDGF stim-ulates and DKK-1 inhibits proliferation independently of thecanonical WNT pathway, even though LRP-6 is activated. Tostudy whether DKK-1 mediates its effects through an alternativecell-surface signaling mechanism or whether LRP-6 is necessaryfor the PDGF signaling pathway in this context, we immunopre-cipitated PDGFR\u03b2 from pericytes and pulled down active pLRP-6 only when the receptor was engaged with ligand (Fig. 4K), in-dicating a close relationship between the two receptors at the timeof signaling. Next, we overexpressed dominant-negative mutatedforms of LRP-6 in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (3T3)that endogenously expresses PDGFR\u03b2 (Fig. 4L and Fig. S6).Expression of two different dominant-negative forms of LRP-6,but not theWT form, was sufficient to inhibit proliferation of 3T3cells in response to PDGF-BB and to prevent DKK-1 effects (Fig.4L), indicating that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation through signal-ing via LRP-6 and revealing that LRP-6 can be detected in acomplex containing PDGFR\u03b2. Finally, because LRP-6 is requiredfor PDGF-induced proliferation, we assessed whether WNTligands are necessary for PDGF responses by blocking WNT se-cretion in pericytes using the Porcupine homolog inhibitor, IWP2(Fig. S7). Porcupine homolog is required for palmitoylation andsecretion of all WNTs from cells (16). IWP2, blocked PDGF-stimulated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner withoutaffecting viability, suggesting that WNT engagement of LRP-6 atthe cell surface is necessary for PDGF responses in pericytes.Fig. 4.

Our in vivo stud-ies showed that DKK-1 prevents pericyte activation, detachmentfrom capillaries, migration, and expression of the myofibroblastmarker \u03b1SMA (Fig. 3). Previous and current studies (2, 14)suggest that PDGFR signaling does not affect these pericytechanges directly. Therefore we tested the effect of DKK-1 onpericyte activation and migration in response to other cytokinesimplicated in these processes (17, 18). In contrast to PDGF,TGF-\u03b2markedly and rapidly stimulates pericyte migration (Fig. 5A\u2013C), and over 48\u201372 h up-regulates collagen genes and the in-termediate filament \u03b1SMA (Fig. 5D). Similar observations onmigration were made by treatment of pericytes with CTGF (Fig. 5C andD), an extracellular protein that may signal via \u03b21-integrins,LRP-1, and possibly LRP-6 (19), and with CCN1 (Fig. S8A).TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF promote marked cytoskeletal reorganizationof contractile filaments in pericytes after 24 h of cytokine treat-ment (Fig. 5E). DKK-1 inhibits all migratory, activatory, andcytoskeletal changes in pericytes in response to TGF-\u03b2 or CTGF(Fig. 5 A\u2013E) but has no impact on migration in response to CCN1(Fig. S8A). Strikingly, primary cultures of kidney epithelial cellshave high endogenous migration that is weakly responsive tothese cytokines. DKK-1 has a nonsignificant effect on these cul-tures (Fig. S3), suggesting DKK-1 has a major effect on pericytes,not epithelium.We next tested the impact of DKK-1 on activation of LRP-6in the context of these activating ligands. TGF-\u03b2, and CTGF bothactivate LRP-6 within minutes of cytokine exposure, and, as ex-pected, WNT3a also stimulates LRP-6 activation (Fig. 5F andFigs. S5E and S8B). Within 10 min, DKK-1 weakly activates LRP-6 (Fig. S5C) and does not block the activation triggered by TGF-\u03b2orWNT3a (Fig. 5F and Fig. S8). However, LRP-6 was deactivatedby DKK-1 in all activation conditions after 16 h (Fig. S5), indi-cating LRP-6 is activated rapidly by non-WNT ligands and DKK-1either augments that signal weakly or does not affect it initially butsilences it only at later time points. Because DKK-1 blocks TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated changes to pericytes, we tested whether TGF-\u03b2 signalsvia the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway directly or indirectly. TGF-\u03b2 reg-ulates WNT ligands in pericytes at 24 h (up-regulating Wnt2, 9a,and 11 and down-regulating Wnt2b and 16) (Fig. 5G), but DKK-1had no impact on these changes. Both TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF triggerednuclear \u03b2-catenin activity in pericytes (Fig. 5H); this activity wasinhibited by DKK-1, but, as with PDGF, the effect occurred ina minority of cells, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 and CTGFmay regulatepericyte activation via aWNT/\u03b2-catenin\u2013independent pathway andthat DKK-1 may inhibit pericyte activation via that same pathway.We tested the effect of DKK-1 on TGF-\u03b2\u2013 and CTGF-medi-ated signaling. Both TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF stimulate the P42/P44,P38, and JNK pathways. DKK-1 blocks activation of the P42/44and JNK pathways and augments activation of the P38 pathway(Fig. 5 I and J). As expected, FAK is activated by both TGF-\u03b2and CTGF and is inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 5 I and J). To testwhether components of these DKK-1\u2013regulated signaling cas-cades are responsible for the impact on migration, we measuredthe effect of DKK-1 on TGF-\u03b2 activation of the canonical SMADactivation pathway (Fig. S8C), which was not affected. Nextwe used small-molecule inhibitors of activation of TGF\u03b2R1(SB431542), JNK (SP600125), P42/P44 (U0126), or \u03b2-catenin(XAV939) in TGF-\u03b2\u2013 or CTGF-stimulated migration assays.P42/P44, TGF\u03b2R1, and \u03b2-catenin inhibitors had no significanteffect on TGF-\u03b2\u2013stimulated migration, but JNK inhibitorsblocked migration to TGF-\u03b2 completely (Fig. 5K and Fig. S8D),suggesting DKK-1\u2013mediated silencing of JNK signaling is centralto its ability to block TGF-\u03b2\u2013stimulated migration. Inhibition ofCTGF-mediated migration was independent of TGF\u03b2R1 activa-tion, was partially dependent on \u03b2-catenin and P42/P44 activa-tion, and was most dependent on JNK activation (Fig. 5L),highlighting similarities to and differences from TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediatedmigration. CCN1-mediated migration occurred independently ofP42/44 and JNK pathways (Fig. S8A). Because XAV939 showedlittle effect on TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated migration, we generated peri-cytes lacking \u03b2-catenin as described above (Fig. 4J). Comparedwith controls, in the absence of \u03b2-catenin, DKK-1 completelyblocked TGF-\u03b2\u2013stimulated migration (Fig. 5M). However,overall (nonstimulated) migration was reduced in the absence of\u03b2-catenin, indicating that DKK-1 can function independently ofWNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling but that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathwayFig. 5.

To testwhether LRP-6 also associated with the TGF\u03b2R complex,TGF\u03b2R1 was immunoprecipitated, and pLRP-6 was coprecipi-tated in resting cells. This association increased upon active sig-naling (Fig. 5N). To determine the role of LRP-6 in TGF-\u03b2\u2013stimulated migration, we studied expression of the dominant-negative LRP-6 mutants in fibroblasts, as described above (Fig.4L). Strikingly, although TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated migration occurred inthe presence of mutant LRP-6, DKK-1 was now ineffective (Fig.5O). Therefore, DKK-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2 migration by an LRP-6\u2013dependent mechanism, and active LRP-6 can be detected ina signaling complex with TGF\u03b2R1. That TGF-\u03b2 stimulates mi-gration in the presence of dominant-negative LRP-6 but DKK-1no longer functions suggests that the endogenous LRP-6 still maybe able to interact with TGF-\u03b2, whereas DKK-1 binds equally tothe mutant forms; further studies will be required to understandLRP-6 interactions with TGF\u03b2R1. Finally, to test the role ofWNTsin TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated migration and in DKK-1 inhibition, weblockedWNT secretion using IWP2 as described above (Fig. S7).In this setting TGF-\u03b2\u2013stimulated migration was blocked com-pletely, suggestingWNT engagement of LRP-6 at the cell surfaceis necessary for TGF-\u03b2 response in pericytes.These studies identify LRP-6 and signaling pathways down-stream of LRP-6 as therapeutic targets to intervene in fibro-genesis of the kidney. In addition, they identify the soluble pro-tein DKK-1 and its receptor LRP-6 as important cofactors inmultiple signaling pathways activated by TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, andPDGF (Fig. S8E). Because these multiple pathways are known tocontribute to the development of fibrosis and its longer-termconsequences on organ function, therapeutically delivered DKK-1 or therapeutic targeting of the LRP-6 receptor are attractivestrategies for treating fibrosis, microvascular inflammation, tubuleinjury, and microvascular rarefaction. Recent studies indicate thatmesenchyme-derived cells, either pericytes or resident fibroblasts,are present in all organs and tissues and are the primary source ofscar-forming myofibroblasts in multiple tissues (2, 20). Thereforeit is likely that the DKK-1/LRP-6 signaling pathway regulatesfibrogenesis in multiple organs and tissues.The MAPK signaling pathways from TGF\u03b2R signaling, CTGFsignaling, and PDGFR signaling appear to be functionally criticalin the mesenchyme-derived perivascular cells in kidney. Thesepathways have received relatively little attention, and earlierstudies have assumed that the canonical pathways activated bythese receptors have been dominant in the process of fibrogenesis(14, 21); further studies should focus on these pathways in peri-cytes and fibroblasts. Our studies show that LRP-6 (and poten-tially LRP-5), when bound by WNT ligands, interacts physicallywith PDGFR\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2R1 upon cognate ligand interaction(Fig. S8E). It is possible, therefore, that LRP-6 is responsible fortransducing the signal that activates the MAPK pathways. Fur-ther studies should address this question. The fact that LRP-6 canfunction as a coreceptor for multiple pathways raises the questionwhether it requires an extracellular ligand, distinct from WNTligands, to effect this interaction. It is likely that soluble ligandssuch as TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF are presented at the cell surface boundto extracellular modulators and that these complexes may bind toand be responsible for the recruitment of LRP-6. The studies alsoindicate that in pericytes and myofibroblasts CTGF activates cellsindependently of TGF-\u03b2, whereas previous reports have sug-gested CTGF augments TGF-\u03b2 responses in fibrogenesis. Thesestudies suggest CTGF has a distinct receptor on pericytes andmyofibroblasts that has not been fully appreciated. Furtherstudies should define the CTGF receptor in these cells and theinteraction of LRP-6 with that receptor.Genetic studies of LRP-6 and LRP-5 function in mice point totheir major role in WNT pathway signal transduction in early andlater embryogenesis (5). However, the initial studies suggestedthat LRP-5/LRP-6 mutations interfered with other signalingpathways, including FGFR1 and Notch Delta (22). Recently,LRP-6 mutations have been found not only in humans with re-duced bone mineral density but also in patients with prematurecardiovascular disease (4, 5). These reports also have suggesteda potential link between LRP-6 and PDGFR signaling. In thecontext of our current findings, these studies suggest that LRP-6may regulate multiple signaling pathways in mesenchyme-de-rived cells that play critical roles in bone mineralization, arterialwall functions, and microvascular wall functions.We conclude that DKK-1 is antifibrotic and anti-inflammatoryby inhibiting multiple signaling pathways in pericytes and myofi-broblasts through binding to the cell-surface receptors LRP-5/-6,which in turn act as coreceptors for multiple signaling pathways.Materials and MethodsMouse Models.
