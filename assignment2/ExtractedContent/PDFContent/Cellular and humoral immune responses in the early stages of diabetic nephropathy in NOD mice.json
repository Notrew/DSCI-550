We found that the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were infiltrated with T and Bcells, as well as CD11c\u00fe dendritic cells, which had close contact with CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells in theinfiltrates. We also found that IgG deposits in the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were accompanied bythe presence of complement C3. Moreover, the serum from diabetic mice contained autoantibodiesdirected towards components of the glomeruli and these antibodies were not present in non-diabeticNOD mice. The immune changes in the kidney occurred together with increasing kidney weight andurinary albumin excretion along with duration of diabetes. We provide evidence that infiltratinglymphocytes and anti-kidney autoantibodies may be involved in diabetic nephropathy in autoimmunediabetes in the NOD mouse. Understanding the role that the immune system plays in the pathogenesis ofdiabetic nephropathy could lead to identification of new strategies and/or additional therapeutic targetsfor prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionDiabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renalfailure in young people and affects about 40% of individuals withlong-standing type 1 diabetes [1]. Current therapy, which includestreatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia canslow the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy [2], buteventually end-stage renal failure will still occur in a proportion ofpatients [3]. Therefore, the effects of currently used treatmentsmust be maximized and identification of new strategies and addi-tional therapeutic targets for treating diabetic nephropathy will beimportant.Many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of diabeticnephropathy, which in humans is defined by a progressive rise in: \u00fe1 203 737 5558.x: \u00fe44 117 928 7896.san Wong), li.wen@yale.edustudy.All rights reserved.albuminuria, together with increasing blood pressure, leading toa fall in glomerular filtration and ultimately end-stage renal failure[3]. Microalbuminuria may occur as early as 5 years after diagnosis ofdiabetes [3]. Structural abnormalities include glomerular basementmembrane thickening, increased number of mesangial cells andmesangial expansion [4]. Metabolic factors, such as the formation ofadvanced glycation end products and increased flux through thepolyol pathways, have been implicated [5]. In addition, growthfactors (transforming growth factor TGF-b, insulin-like growthfactor IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF) may alsoplay a role [5,6]. Although the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathyis not considered to be primarily immune mediated, neverthelessstudies examining renal biopsies in patients with type 1 diabeteshave noted T cell infiltration of the juxtaglomerular apparatus [7,8].Macrophages have also been detected in kidney sections frompatients with diabetic nephropathy although no distinction wasmade between patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [9].To facilitate dissection of pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy,a variety of experimental rat and mouse models have been used,many of which relate to type 2 diabetes. In the present study, wemailto:susan.wong@bristol.ac.ukmailto:li.wen@yale.eduwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08968411www.elsevier.com/locate/jautimmX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139386focused on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model thatdevelops spontaneous autoimmune diabetes similar to human type1 diabetes [10]. Many studies of diabetic nephropathy were per-formed in chemically-induced diabetic animal models and NODmice have not been studied much in terms of diabetic nephropathy,perhaps because of the potentially long and variable time to onsetof diabetes [11]. However, a few studies have shown that NOD micecould develop renal pathology after the onset of diabetes [12,13]. Totest the hypothesis that immune responses are involved in thedevelopment of diabetic nephropathy, we investigated cellular andhumoral immune parameters in spontaneous diabetic NOD mice.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsFemale NOD/Caj mice were used in this study. All the mice werehoused in individually-ventilated filter cages with autoclaved foodunder specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with a 12-h dark/light cycle. The use of the animals and the procedures applied inthis study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee of Yale University.2.2. Determination of diabetes and diabetic nephropathyNOD mice were observed for diabetes development by weeklyscreening for glycosuria. Diabetes was confirmed following 2consecutive readings of blood glucose greater than 13.9 mmol/L(250 mg/dl). Mouse urine was screened for proteinuria by Albustix(Bayer, Elkhart, IN, USA). Diabetic mice were given a sub-thera-peutic dose of insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) after diagnosisin order to maintain the animals in a hyperglycemic state, in therange of 13.9\u201322.2 mmol/L, but in relatively good general health.Blood glucose and proteinuria were monitored weekly. Twenty-four hour urine collections were obtained using metabolic cagesand quantitation of urine albumin was determined using theProtein Assay Kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The urine creatinine was measured byCayman creatinine assay kit (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).2.3. HistologyMice were perfused with ice-cold PBS and then with buffercontaining 10% formalin. Tissues were further fixed in 4% bufferedparaformaldehyde for 2 days, embedded in paraffin and processedfor sectioning. Extracellular matrix deposition in glomeruli wasassessed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.2.4. Immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopyPerfused kidney was fixed overnight in periodate\u2013lysine\u2013para-formaldehyde (PLP) fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 M lysine,0.037 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M periodate). The tissue was thenembedded in OCT compound from Tissue-Tek (Torrance, CA, USA)and snap frozen. Cryosections (10 mm) were rehydrated with PBSfollowed by blocking with 2% goat serum (Sigma Immunochemicals,St. Louis, MO, USA). The following primary antibodies were used forstaining the kidney sections: phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugateddonkey anti-mouse IgG and rat anti-mouse CD31 (eBioscience, SanDiego, CA, USA), rabbit anti-mouse laminin (Meridian Life Science,Saco, ME, USA), rat anti-mouse CD4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11c,rat anti-mouse CD8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), rabbit anti-mouse perforin antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rat anti-C3antibody (Cedarlane, Burlington, NC, USA). Secondary antibodies(goat anti rat Alexa 488, 546; goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, goat antiFITC Alexa 488 were obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA,and goat anti-rabbit Cy5 at1:300 were obtained from Abcam(Cambridge, MA, USA). Kidney sections were examined and photo-graphed using a META510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thorn-wood, NY, USA). Images were acquired with a 63\ufffdwater-immersionobjective lens. For some micrographs, Tile Scan was performed toobtain high-resolution images from large areas of the organ.2.5. Electron microscopyAfter perfusion the kidneys were excised and immersed in freshfixatives (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4)for w16 h at 4 \ufffdC. For morphological studies, the tissue blocks werepost-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanidein 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, treated with aqueous 1% uranyl acetate,dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Polybedepoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections werecut, collected on 200 mesh copper/rhodium grids, and stained withuranyl acetate and lead citrate and then were observed at 60 kV ina Philips CM10 transmission EM.For immunogold labeling, osmium post-fixation was omitted,and the tissue blocks were embedded in LR Gold acrylic resin, andpolymerized with UV light at\ufffd20 \ufffdC. The sections were treated withbovine serum albumin (BSA), with or without normal goat serum(the species in which the secondary antibody was raised), in PBSwith 0.1% Tween 20 to block non-specific binding, then incubatedwith rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,PA, USA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)overnight at 4 \ufffdC. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubatedwith a gold-labeled secondary antibody \u2013 15 nm gold-labeled goatanti-rabbit IgG (Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands) for 60 min atroom temperature. Following rinse with PBS and distilled water, thesections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate andexamined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope.2.6. RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated from mouse kidney tissues using TRIzol(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal amounts of RNA, measured byspectrophotometer and RNA gel, were used for first-strand cDNAsynthesis with SuperScript III-RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) ina 20 ml reaction. 0.5 ml of cDNA product was then subject to the quan-titative PCR (qPCR) amplification. The primers were designed using thePrimer Bank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) and synthe-sized by Sigma. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using aniCycler system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and SYBR green I was usedto detect the PCR products. The integrity of DNA products was verifiedby both the presence of a single melting temperature peak and a singleband on a 1.2% agarose gel. Post-PCR data were analyzed by the iQ\ufffd 5optical system software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Relative quanti-fication was determined using 2\ufffdDDCt method with data normalized tothe mRNA level of housekeeping gene GAPDH.2.7. Determination of anti-insulin autoantibodiesThe serum samples of diabetic NOD mice were tested for thepresence of anti-insulin autoantibodies before and after the onsetof diabetes and institution of insulin treatment as previouslydescribed [14].2.8. Statistical analysisThe data were presented as means\ufffd SD or means\ufffd SE. Statisticalanalysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software 4.0 (San Diego,http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbankFig. 1.

T test or one way ANOVAwas performed wherever appropriate. Post-hoc Bonferroni pairwisecomparison was followed to assess significance between two groups.3. Results3.1. Cellular immune responses in diabetic kidneysTo investigate whether cellular immune responses are involvedin the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, we examinedmononuclear cell infiltration in glomeruli with confocal micros-copy at monthly intervals after the development of diabetes. All thekidneys were perfused before preparation of tissue sections. Wefound that CD4\u00fe (Fig. 1B\u2013D, F\u2013H) and CD8\u00fe (Fig. 1J\u2013L) T cells werepresent in the glomeruli in diabetic mice. Dendritic cells (CD11c\u00fe)were also present in the infiltrates, in close contact with both CD4(Fig. 1B\u2013D, F\u2013H) and CD8 T cells (Fig. 1J\u2013L). In addition, heavylymphocytic infiltration including IgG\u00fe B cells could also be foundclose to blood vessels (Fig. 1N). IgG\u00fe B cells were either in clustersor scattered individually (Fig. 1O\u2013P). In sharp contrast, no immuneX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139388cell infiltration was seen in glomeruli or other parts of the kidneyfrom non-diabetic control mice (Fig. 1A,E,I,M).3.2. mRNA expression of perforin and granzyme B andco-localization of perforin with CD8\u00fe T cellsCD8\u00fe T cells use release of perforin and granzyme B for theircytolytic function. We evaluated perforin and granzyme B mRNAexpression in the kidney by real-time PCR. Total cellular RNA wasisolated from the renal cortex of diabetic and non-diabetic mice.Fig. 2A demonstrated a significant increase of perforin and gran-zyme B mRNA expression in the renal cortex in diabetic animalscompared with non-diabetic animals (P< 0.01). This was furtherconfirmed by confocal microscopy showing co-localization of CD8and perforin staining (Fig. 2B and Supplementary 3D movie),whereas neither CD8\u00fe T cells nor perforin could be found in thekidneys of non-diabetic NOD mice (Fig. 2B).3.3. Humoral immune responses in diabetic kidneysAs IgG\u00fe B cells were found in the glomeruli of diabetic NODmice, to identify whether secreted IgGs were also present in theglomeruli, we stained the diabetic kidney sections with fluores-cence-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. As shown in Fig. 3A, IgG depo-sition was found in kidney sections of all stages of diabetes (1\u20133months after clinical onset). In sharp contrast, there was no IgGstaining if the kidney sections from non-diabetic NOD mice wereused (Fig. 3A). The IgG found in the glomeruli may be produced bythe infiltrating B cells in situ (Fig. 3A) or deposited from thecirculation (see below). It is interesting that the IgG deposition wasassociated with CD31, which is expressed on endothelial andFig. 2. Presence of perforin and CD8 cells in diabetic kidneys.

The associ-ation of IgG deposition with CD31 and laminin suggests that the IgGdeposits are likely to be on endothelial cells and glomerular base-ment membrane (GBM). To further investigate the IgG deposition,we performed electron microscopy with immunogold staining, inwhich the secondary antibody was labeled with gold. As shown inFig. 3D, most of the gold was present over deposits that werelocated in and around mesangial cells or between mesangial cellsand endothelial cells. Gold particles were also present over theGBM (Fig. 3D). In addition, some gold particles were found in thecytoplasm or lysosomes of mesangial-like cells, which suggestedthat these cells may have endocytosed IgG (Fig. 3D). There was nogold staining in kidneys from non-diabetic mice (Fig. 3D).3.4. Diabetic NOD mice produce autoantibodiesTo further investigate the IgG found in kidneys of diabetic NODmice, we examined serum samples from diabetic and non-diabeticNOD mice. Using perfused kidney sections from normal non-dia-betic mice, we incubated the sections with serum samples takenfrom mice at different times after the onset of diabetes followed byfluorescence-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as detecting antibody. Itis interesting that IgG staining was only found in the sections whenserum samples from diabetic mice were used as primary antibody(Fig. 4A) whereas there was no IgG staining when non-diabeticmouse sera were used (Fig. 4B). As the mice were treated withhuman insulin after the onset of diabetes, we tested for the pres-ence of anti-insulin autoantibodies to ascertain if anti-insulinantibodies forming immune complexes were responsible for thedeposition in the kidneys. However, there was no obviouspression levels in the kidney of non-diabetic control mice compared with kidneys fromd as fold increase relative to the non-diabetic control mice.

Kidney hypertrophy and urinary albumin excretion in diabeticNOD miceTo further document renal changes after the onset of diabetes,we found that the normalized kidney weight increased with theduration of diabetes in NOD mice, implying kidney hypertrophy(Fig. 6A). It is interesting that the normalized kidney weightremained unchanged one month post diabetes onset but theweight significantly increased two months after disease onset witha further increase after three months, at which time the experi-ments were terminated (Fig. 6A). Although kidney hypertrophy didnot occur one month after diabetes onset in these mice, urinaryalbumin excretion rate (UAE) had significantly increased at thattime (Fig. 6B). UAE was further elevated at two months andremained at the same level by three months when the experimentwas terminated (Fig. 6B), while the normalized kidney weight ofthese mice continued to increase significantly (P< 0.01, Fig. 6A).The mean blood glucose over this time remained unchanged withsub-therapeutic doses of insulin during the three-month experi-mental period (Fig. 6C, P> 0.05), although the glucose level wassignificantly higher, as expected, than in non-diabetic control NODmice (Fig. 6C, P< 0.001).Fig. 6.

Glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix expansionAs one of the hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy is mesangialmatrix expansion, we investigated the progression of mesangialmatrix expansion in diabetic NOD mice by analyzing the kidneysections obtained at different time points after diabetes onset. Asshown in Fig. 7A, glomerular hypertrophy and acceleratedmesangial matrix expansion progressed with duration of thedisease, which was characterized by an increased area(s) positivefor PAS staining compared with non-diabetic controls. To furtherinvestigate the structural changes of the glomeruli, especially theGBM, we performed transmission electron microscopy. The GBMwas thicker in diabetic mice compared with non-diabetic controlsand the alterations in thickness were irregular and regional(Fig. 7B). We also found extracellular matrix accumulation indiabetic kidneys under electron microscopy (Fig. 7B).4. DiscussionOur study has shown that, firstly, in the early stages of diabetesin the NOD mouse, both T and B cells infiltrate the glomeruli.Secondly, we have demonstrated that serum components fromFig. 7.

Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u201393 91diabetic NOD mice, but not non-diabetic NOD mice, bind to normalkidney sections, indicating the presence of autoantibodies to thekidney. These autoantibodies only develop after the mice becomediabetic and appear to be directed towards renal endothelial cellsand the glomerular basement membrane. Thirdly, we have shownthe presence of complement C3 deposits in the kidney. Fourthly, indocumenting the natural history of renal changes in the NODmouse after the onset of autoimmune diabetes, we have shown thatUAE started to increase after 1 month of diabetes, with furtherincreases as the duration of diabetes increased. Furthermore, thekidney weight increased, together with evidence of mesangialexpansion, and this is consistent with renal hypertrophy occurringafter at least 1 month of hyperglycemia.There has, thus far, been limited knowledge about immunecell recruitment into renal tissues in diabetic nephropathy,although recent studies have suggested a role for immune cells indiabetic nephropathy [16]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, thepresence of nephropathy has been associated with increasedactivated peripheral blood T cells [17] and more recently, infil-tration of T cells into the kidney [8]. In addition, other indicatorsX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139392of inflammation in serum such as mannan-binding lectin are alsoassociated with diabetic nephropathy [18\u201320]. Furthermore, Tcells that have receptors for advanced glycation end products(AGEs) have been shown to produce interferon-g upon interac-tion with AGEs [21] and if attracted into the kidney they couldcontribute to local inflammation and tissue damage. We foundthat both CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration together with CD11ccells in glomeruli in diabetic NOD animals. Not only do NOD micedevelop diabetes, but they also have immune cell infiltration inthe salivary glands, thyroid, adrenal glands and reproductiveorgans [22]. Unlike the spontaneous lymphocytic infiltration intothese organs, we have shown that lymphocyte infiltration andtissue damage in kidney only occurs after development of dia-betes and this may indicate that there is an immune componentassociated with the development of proteinuria in diabeticnephropathy to which individuals are genetically susceptible butthat requires an important trigger in the form of hyperglycemicdamage or an environmental insult [23].In addition to the lymphocytic infiltrate, we have also observedantibody deposits within the kidney, particularly in the glomeruliand related to CD31 and laminin. Immunogold electron microscopyindicated that the IgG deposits were subendothelial and mesangialdeposits. Such deposits tend to occur in tandem, leading to activeinflammation when deposits are extensive. Immunogold electronmicroscopy also demonstrated the deposition of IgA in the kidney(data not shown). They occur later than IgG, and are possiblyassociated with a later stage of immune response as class switchingto IgA normally takes place after IgG.It is interesting that serum from diabetic mice contained anti-bodies that reacted to kidney components whereas this was notseen in the sera from non-diabetic mice. Preliminary western blotanalysis indicated that proteins of two different molecular weightsaround 30 and 60 kD were immunoprecipitated (data not shown)but at this time, it is not known what the proteins are and this willbe a focus of future study.The association of circulating immune complexes with diabeticcomplications has been studied in the past with suggestions thatincreased levels of immune complexes are found in patients withdiabetic microangiopathic complications, including oxidized LDL-anti-oxidized LDL immune complexes [24\u201326]. It is not clearwhether immune complexes with insulin are contributory tomicroangiopathic complications [27]. In the present study, we gavea small dose of human insulin to maintain diabetic animals but wefound no obvious correlation between the presence of IgG bindingin the kidney sections and the presence of anti-insulin autoanti-bodies in circulation, indicating that the antibodies in the IgG foundin the kidney were not due to immune complexes associated withinsulin autoantibody in this model.In this study, we demonstrated glomerular IgG and C3 in dia-betic NOD kidneys as diabetes developed. Notably, age-matchedNOD mice that did not develop diabetes showed no deposition ofIgG or C3 in the glomeruli compared to diabetic animals, implyingthat IgG and C3 deposition in glomeruli is associated with diabetesrather than the genetic make-up of these animals. Activation of thecomplement system has also been reported to play a pathogenicrole in human diabetic nephropathy [19,20,28]. NOD mice have nocomplement lytic activity as they lack C5 due to a two-base pairdeletion in the coding region of Hc and therefore, the complementpathway cannot be activated [15]. However, they have normallevels of C3, which could be involved in the activation of theautoreactive B cell populations via the C3d component [29].In humans, the increase in UAE is predominantly related toabnormalities in the glomerulus [3]. In our study we demonstratedincreased UAE, together with histological changes of irregularbasement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion.However, this may also be due to metabolic changes in addition tothe immune abnormalities.In conclusion, the present studies provide strong evidence forthe involvement of cellular and humoral immune responses in theearly stages of diabetic nephropathy in NOD mice.Although further investigation should focus on the identifica-tion of antigens which initiate the immune response, our resultsfrom this study substantially extend recent reports indicating thatimmune responses play an important role in diabetic nephropathy.Further elucidation of mechanisms of immune-mediated damagewill hopefully lead to new therapeutic strategies and/or additionaltherapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diabeticnephropathy.AcknowledgementsXiaoyan Xiao is a scholarship recipient from the China Schol-arship Council (2007-102113).
