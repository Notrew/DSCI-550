KreydiyThe activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase was shown to be reduced during apoptosis and enhanced during cellproliferation. This work investigated whether TNF-a exerts also opposite effects on the Na+/K+ ATPasein HepG2 cells and whether these effects are time-dependent. A time response study demonstrated thatthe activity and protein expression of the ATPase are decreased at 1 h and increased at 4, 6 and 8 h. Thiswork focused on the up-regulatory 4 h-response. TNF-a was shown to exert a stimulatory effect on cJNKand NF-jB and an inhibitory effect on caspases which, in the basal state, down-regulate the ATPase. Thecytokine was found to target the caspases by activating JNK which in turn activates NF-jB. The activatedtranscription factor inhibits the caspases and frees the ATPase from their inhibitory action leading thus toits up-regulation.\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionTumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory cytokinewith numerous biological properties ranging from inflammation toproliferation, differentiation, and cancer growth. It plays a centralrole in shock due to sepsis and wasting syndromes due to a varietyof cancers [1]. It is also involved in different physiological andpathophysiological conditions [2]. In the liver it was described toact as a \u2018\u2018two-edged sword\u201d [3], exerting both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects.These antagonistic effects were ascribed to the multiple andcomplex signaling pathways activated by the cytokine. Caspases,nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [4],proteases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species, were all foundto mediate TNF-a action. While activation of NF-jB was found cru-cial for cell survival, activation of caspases was deemed essentialfor the apoptotic process. The role of JNK is however still contro-versial promoting both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses [5].Apoptosis was found to be accompanied by changes in the lev-els of Na+, K+ , and Cl\ufffd , and a decrease in the activity of the Na+/K+ATPase also known as Na+/K+ pump [6], a ubiquitous transporterresponsible for the establishment of the trans-membrane Na+and K+ gradients. In a previous work we studied the 1 h effect ofTNF-a on the Na+-/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells. The activity of theATPase was found to be modulated by JNK, which stimulated thell rights reserved.yeh).caspases and inhibited NF-jB, resulting in a net inhibition of thepump, and probably favoring the apoptotic pathway [7]. SinceTNF was reported also to promote cell proliferation in hepatocytes[8], we speculated that these antagonistic responses may be due todifferences in the period of action of the cytokine. TNF-a may beactivating different mediators at different time intervals leadingto opposite effects.This work aimed at testing this hypothesis and determining themechanism of action of the cytokine.2.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 313All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St.Louis, Missouri, USA.2.2. Methods2.2.1. Culture and treatment of HepG2 CellsHepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,1% Penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified incubator (5% CO2)at 37 \ufffdC. When 70\u201380% confluence was reached, the cells werestarved overnight and treated next day.Dose and time response studies were conducted by treating thecells with different doses of TNF-a (5, 10, 40, and 100 ng/ml) for4 h, and with 100 ng/ml of TNF-a for different time periods (1, 2,3, 4, 6, and 8 h). The involvement of caspases, JNK and NF-jBwas studied by pre-treating the cells with their respective specificinhibitors FK009 (4 lM) ([9], SP 600125 (50 lM) [10] and PDTC(100 lM) [11] . FK009 was added 15 min before TNF-a, while PDTCand SP 600125 were added 30 min before the cytokine.At the end of the incubation period, HepG2 cells were washed,lysed, homogenized with a polytron at 4 \ufffdC and 20,000 rpm, andpreserved at \ufffd20 \ufffdC for later use after addition of protease inhibi-tors. Proteins were quantified using the Biorad assay.2.2.2. Western blot analysisEqual amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on 8% poly-acrylamide gels, and were transferred to PVD F membranes. Themembranes were then blocked and incubated with a primaryNa+/K+ ATPase a1 antibody, followed by a secondary IgG conju-gated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection of the signal was by en-hanced chemiluminescence. Equal loading was checked byPonceau staining, a rapid and reversible staining method for visu-alizing protein bands on Western blots.2.2.3. NF-jB activityActivation of NF-jB by TNF was investigated by examining thedegradation of its inhibitory subunit IjBa. The expression of IjBwas studied by western blot analysis as described above using 10%polyacrylamide gels and an anti-IjBa monoclonal antibody with agoat anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.2.2.4. Na+/K+ ATPase activity assayHomogenates of HepG2 cells were suspended in Tris buffer(1300 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM histidine;pH 7.4) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Saponin (1%) was thenadded at a ratio of 1:4 and the samples were incubated at roomtemperature for 30 min. Aliquots (50 ll) were then drawn andincubated at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min, in presence or absence of ouabain(3.75 mM final concentration), a specific inhibitor of the ATPase.Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (7.5 mM final concentration) wasthen added and the samples were incubated for an additional30 min at 37 \ufffdC. At the end of the incubation period, an equal vol-ume of trichloroacetic acid (11.5%) was added to stop the reaction,and the samples were spun at 3000g for 5 min. The amount ofinorganic phosphate liberated was measured colorimetricallyaccording to the method of Taussky and Shorr [12]. The enzymaticactivity was determined by measuring the ouabain inhibitableinorganic phosphate (Pi) released. The percent inhibition of theenzyme activity was calculated as follows:1\ufffdPi\u00f0treatment\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0treatment \u00fe ouabain\u00dePi\u00f0control\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0control\u00fe ouabain\u00de\ufffd 100Fig. 1b.

Briefly JNKwas immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its activity deter-mined using recombinant c_jun as a substrate. Phosphorylationof c-Jun was detected by western blot analysis.2.2.6. Statistical analysisResults are reported as means \u00b1 SE and are tested for statisticalsignificance by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followedby Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparisons test using Instat and ExcelAnalysis softwares. The results were considered significant atP < 0.01.3. Results3.1. Time and dose response studies on the effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cellsTNF-a at 100 ng/ml reduced the activity and protein expressionof the Na+/K+ ATPase at 1 h, and enhanced them at 4, 6 and 8 h(Fig. 1a). The most prominent increase was observed at 4 h andwas maintained till 8 h (P < 0.001). This is why all further studieswere conducted at 4 h. The effect on pump\u2019s expression followedthe same pattern as the effect on the pump\u2019s activity (Fig. 1b).A dose response study was then conducted to see if the effect ofthe cytokine on the pump is concentration-dependent. The activityof the Na+/K+ATPase was significantly increased in starved cellstreated for 4 h with 40 and 100 ng/ml TNF-a and unchanged atlower doses (5 and 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1c).Since the up-regulatory effect observed at 4 h opposed whatwas found previously at 1 h, we decided to investigate the 4-h re-sponse and the signaling pathways involved.Fig. 1c.

Mediators of the late (4 h) effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase inHepG2 cells3.3.1. Involvement of JNK and NF-KBAt 4 h, TNF decreased the expression of IKBa (Fig. 2a) and in-creased significantly the phosphorylation of c-jun (Fig. 2b) reveal-ing an activation of NF-jB and JNK by the cytokine.The involvement of NF-jB and Jun Kinase in the late (4 h) re-sponse was studied by using their respective inhibitors PDTC andSP600125.PDTC alone had no effect on the expression and activity of thepump but abrogated completely the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a andb). The ATPase was down-regulated by SP600125 and in its pres-ence the up-regulatory effect of TNF was significantly reduced(Fig. 3a and b).3.3.2. Involvement of caspasesTo determine whether TNF-a signaling is mediated throughcaspases, HepG2 cells were treated with FK009 a general caspaseinhibitor. The inhibitor FK009 alone, increased both the activityand protein expression of the pump, exerting thus a similar effectto the one observed with TNF-a (Fig. 4a and b). The up-regulatoryeffect of TNF still appeared in presence of FK009 i.e. when caspaseswere inhibited.Fig. 2a. Effect of TNF-a (100 ng/ml, 4 h) on the expression of IjBa.Fig. 2b.

Effect of different combinations of inhibitors on the proteinexpression and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase at 4 hWhen both jun Kinase and NF-jB were inhibited concurrentlywith their respective inhibitors SP600125 and PDTC, a decreasein the activity and protein expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase was ob-served (Fig. 3a and b). This decrease still appeared in presence ofthe cytokine.The up-regulatory effect exerted by FK009 was reduced in pres-ence of PDTC (Fig. 5a and b), but in their simultaneous presence theFig. 4b.

The up-regulatory effect of TNF-a still ap-peared in their presence.Cells treated with the three inhibitors, FK009, SP600125 andPDTC, simultaneously, did not show any change in their Na+/K+ATPase activity or protein expression. However in their presencethe effect of TNF was abrogated completely (Fig. 7a and b).Table 1 summarizes the effect of the different mediators on thepump.Fig. 7b.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u20133184. DiscussionTNF-a is known to activate different mediators and signalingpathways that culminate in either cell survival or cell death. Acti-vation of the caspase cascade leads to apoptosis [13], while activa-tion of NF-jB, induces genes having anti-apoptotic effects. Manyworks demonstrated that apoptosis is accompanied by a reductionin the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase in various experimental modelswhile stimulation of the ATPase was found to accompany liverregeneration [14]. Although many isoforms of the enzyme areknown to exist, the a1 isoform is the one present in hepatocytes[15].4.1. Time and dose response studiesTNF acted on the Na+/K+ ATPase time-dependently (Fig. 1a).Changes in the ATPase activity and protein expression followed asimilar trend (Fig. 1a and b), suggesting that changes in activityare due to changes in the number of ATPase molecules. To deter-mine whether these opposite responses are also dose-dependent,cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-a for4hrs. At 4 h, TNF-a at doses equal or higher than 40 ng/ml exerteda stimulatory effect on the ATPase (Fig. 1c). Since an increase inpump\u2019s activity was reported to occur during liver regeneration[16], it can be speculated that TNF promotes at 4 h cell survival.The mechanism underlying the early inhibitory response wasstudied in a previous work [8]. This work is an attempt to unravelthe signaling mechanism behind the 4 h-response.Table 1A summary of the effect of different inhibitors on the Na+/K+ ATPase.TNF-a PDTC SP00125 FK009+++ +++ +++ ++ ++ + ++ ++ + ++ ++ + ++ + ++ + + +4.2. Signaling mediators4.2.1. TNF stimulates NF-jBInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated completely the effectof TNF-a. The results imply that the effect of TNF-a on NF-jB isstimulatory because had it been inhibitory, then PDTC would haveimitated the effect of TNF-a and an up-regulatory effect wouldhave been observed.4.2.2. TNF stimulates JNKTreating the cells with SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK)abrogated only partially the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and b) suggest-ing the presence of additional mediators that contribute to the ef-fect of TNF on the pump. JNK should be stimulated by the cytokineas was the case with NF-jB and for the same reasons mentionedabove for NF-jB.4.2.3. TNF inhibits caspasesThe up-regulatory response to TNF-a still appeared in presenceof FK009 (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that either caspases are not in-volved in TNF action, or if they are, they are inhibited by the cyto-kine. In the latter case, caspase inhibition should imitate the effectof TNF-a and this is in fact what was observed when FK009 wasadded alone (Fig. 4a and b). Addition of TNF-a simultaneously withFK009, lead to a similar response to the one observed with eachone separately, inferring that caspases are part of the signalingpathway activated by TNF or else an additive effect would havebeen observed.It can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of NF-jBand JNK, and inhibition of caspases. No additional mediators are in-volved in TNF signaling, since when cells were treated with thecytokine in presence of inhibitors of all three mediators the effectof TNF-a disappeared completely (Fig. 7a and b).4.3. Positions of the signaling mediators in the pathway4.3.1. JNK is upstream of NF-jBIt is apparent from the above that caspases, in the basal state,exert an inhibitory effect on the activity and protein expressionof the Na+/K+ ATPase (Fig. 4a and b).The effect of JNK is however stimulatory since a down-regula-tion was observed when it was inhibited with SP 600125. Inhibi-tion of NF-jB did not have any effect on the pump, suggestingthat the transcription factor is not involved in its regulation inthe basal state.The fact that the effect of FK009 was abrogated partially withPDTC but fully with PDTC + SP600125, suggests that NF-jB andEffect on ATPase protein expression Effect on ATPase activityUp-regulation Up-regulationNo effect No effectNo effect No effectDown-regulation Down-regulationReduced up-regulation Reduced up-regulationUp-regulation Up-regulationUp-regulation Up-regulationDown-regulation Down-regulationDown-regulation Down-regulationReduced up-regulation Reduced up-regulationUp-regulation Up-regulationNo effect No EffectUp-regulation Up-regulationNo effect No effectNo effect No effectFig. 8. The signaling pathway underlying the effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPasein HepG2 cells incubated with the cytokine for 4 h.A. Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 317JNK activate two different pathways that stimulate the pump. Itcan be postulated that the basal activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase is abalance between two stimulatory pathways mediated via JNKand NF-jB, and an inhibitory pathway mediated via caspases.When caspases are inhibited, the stimulatory effect of JNK andNF-jB becomes apparent. When caspases and NF-jB are inhibitedconcurrently, the up-regulatory effect is reduced because it be-comes restricted only to the one caused by JNK. However whenJNK and caspases are inhibited concurrently, leaving only NF-jBactive, no change is observed in the ATPase activity and expression.As the up-regulatory effect of NF-jB was not observed in this case,it can be postulated that it is activated by either JNK or caspases.Since the effect of FK009 disappeared partially in presence of PDTCbut fully in presence of SP600125 and SP600125 + PDTC, it cansafely be concluded that JNK is upstream of NF-jB and causes itsactivation.When JNK and NF-jB were inhibited simultaneously (Fig. 3aand b), leaving only the caspases active, down-regulation of thepump was observed. This confirms the inhibitory effect of caspaseson the ATPase, an effect that was not counterbalanced anymore, inthis case, by the stimulatory effect of JNK and NF-jB.4.3.2. JNK is upstream of caspasesThe effect of TNF was abrogated partially in presence ofSP600125 alone but reappeared in the simultaneous presence ofFK009 and SP600125. It can be speculated that TNF-a inhibitsthe caspases via activation of JNK, freeing thus the ATPase fromtheir down-regulatory effect. The data indicate also that JNK is up-stream of caspases.4.3.3. NF-jB is upstream of caspasesInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated the effect of TNF andalthough JNK is still active, no up-regulation was observed becauseit was counteracted by an inhibition caused by active caspases.However, TNF effect reappeared upon simultaneous inhibition ofNF-jB and caspases, implying that when NF-jB is active, it inhibitscaspases and is upstream of them.When JNK and NF-jB are inhibited concurrently, the ATPase isdown-regulated by TNF-a because the caspases remain active andare not inhibited by NF-jB.The cytokine could not exert its effect in presence of inhibitorsof all three mediators since all stimulatory and inhibitory path-ways are blocked. The results infer that no additional mediatorsare involved in the response to TNF-a.4.4. Signaling pathway of TNF-aIt can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of JNK andNF-jB, and inhibition of caspases. NF-jB is upstream of the casp-ases and inhibits them while JNK is upstream of NF-jB and acti-vates it and is itself activated by TNF-a. TNF activates also NF-jBbut this activity is considerably enhanced by JNK. Fig. 8 representsthe postulated signaling pathway underlying the effect of TNF-a onthe Na+/K+ATPase at 4 h.4.5. Possible implications of the up-regulatory effect of TNF-a on theNa+/K+ATPase: roles of the mediatorsUp-regulation of the pump by TNF-a is suggestive of an anti-apoptotic state. In fact, in liver regeneration, the activity of theNa+/K+ATPase was found to be increased [17,7] and NF-jB acti-vated [7].The anti-apoptotic effect of NF-jB in hepatocytes has been verywell documented and its cytoprotective function has been reportedby many studies in various cell types [18\u201323]. Mice deficient in NF-jB activation have been shown to be more susceptible to hepato-carcinogenesis [24]. By activating NF-jB, the cytokine induces anumber of anti-apoptotic genes, including c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, A1,A20, TRAF1, and TRAF2 [5].On the other hand caspases have been well recognized as keymediators of apoptosis and cell death [25,26]. Since an anti-apop-totic state prevails at 4hrs, the observed inhibition of caspases isexpected.The role of JNK is however till now highly controversial. Manyworks correlated activation of JNK with cell death. The kinasewas shown to play a central role in mediating the TNF-inducedapoptotis in hepatocytes [27,28] and developing embryonic fore-brain [29,30]. Other studies however, did not find any associationbetween JNK and cell death [31].In this work JNK activation seems to have an anti-apoptotic role,promoting cell survival and proliferation. These findings are in linewith those reporting a role of JNK in oncogenesis [32\u201334].The TNF-induced activation of JNK observed in this work isneeded to activate in turn NF-jB. One possible mechanism bywhich the kinase could activate the transcription factor wouldbe by phosphorylating directly or indirectly IjB kinase (IKK)leading to its activation. IKK would in turn phosphorylate theinhibitory protein IjB on serine residues [34] targeting it for ubiq-uitination and subsequent degradation, and leading consequentlyto NF-jB activation [18]. Active NF-jB then inhibits caspases.Such an effect has been demonstrated before in fibroblasts by Tanget al. [35].It can be concluded that TNF-a exerts a time-dependent dualand opposite effect on the pump. The early 1 h response is inhibi-tory and suggestive of an apoptotic state while the later responseat 4 h is stimulatory and suggestive of cell survival conditions.Although in both responses JNK is activated and is the key player,yet it exerts opposite effects on its targets namely NF-jB andcaspases which mediate, respectively, cell survival and apoptosis.Caspases are active at 1 h but become inhibited at 4 h. The intrigu-ing question that needs to be addressed is why is there a transientand early activation of caspases that is followed by inhibition? Isthis a step in preparation for the anti-apoptotic state that will ap-pear at 4 h? Su et al. [36] demonstrated previously that a defi-ciency in caspase 8 abolished the activation of NF-jB induced byantigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, andnatural killer cells, ascribing thus a role for caspases in the activa-tion of the transcription factor. It would be plausible then to as-sume that here again, the early and transient activation ofcaspases aims at triggering the activation of NF-jB which in turnwould shut them down.318 A.
