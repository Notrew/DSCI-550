Oxidative stress in the ischemic limbs may accelerate apoptosis of injected EPCs, leading to lessneovascularization. Forkhead transcription factor 4 (FOXO4) was reported to play a pivotal role in apoptosis signaling ofEPCs in response to oxidative stress. Accordingly, we assessed whether FOXO4-knockdown EPCs (FOXO4KD-EPCs) couldsuppress the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and augment the neovascularization capacity in ischemic limbs. Wetransfected small interfering RNA targeted against FOXO4 of human EPCs to generate FOXO4KD-EPCs and confirmed asuccessful knockdown. FOXO4KD-EPCs gained resistance to apoptosis in response to hydrogen peroxide in vitro. Oxidativestress stained by dihydroethidium was stronger for the immunodeficient rat ischemic limb tissue than for the rat non-ischemic one. Although the number of apoptotic EPCs injected into the rat ischemic limb was greater than that of apoptoticEPCs injected into the rat non-ischemic limb, FOXO4KD-EPCs injected into the rat ischemic limb brought less apoptosis andmore neovascularization than EPCs. Taken together, the use of FOXO4KD-EPCs with resistance to oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis may be a new strategy to augment the effects of therapeutic angiogenesis by intramuscular injection of EPCs.Citation: Nakayoshi T, Sasaki K-i, Kajimoto H, Koiwaya H, Ohtsuka M, et al.

Early pro-angiogenic cells (EPCs) [2], which were reported to contribute toadult neovascularization, may offer more options for cell therapy.EPCs can be ex vivo-expanded out of isolated bone marrow-derivedmononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and peripheral blood-derivedmononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) [3], and these cells have been usedfor cell therapy in large-scale clinical trials [4]. We and othersperformed therapeutic angiogenesis by intramuscular injection ofBM-MNCs and PB-MNCs for patients with critical limb ischemiaand reported the effects and safeties [5\u20138]. However, the effectshave been unsatisfactory. Although we and others reported thatthe impaired migration capacity of atherosclerotic patient-derivedBM-MNCs and EPCs in vitro was related to the impairedneovascularization capacity of the cells in vivo [9,10], there maybe other reasons for the unsatisfactory effects.In ischemic limbs, exposure to acute or chronic hypoxia inducesoxidative stress to the skeletal muscle in animals and humans [11\u201313]. In addition, it has been reported that oxidative stress is amediator of apoptosis [14,15]. Thus, ischemia-induced oxidativestress may be increased in the limbs of patients with critical limbischemia and the ischemia-induced oxidative stress may accelerateapoptosis of EPCs injected to the ischemic limbs. The loss of viableEPCs may result in impaired neovascularization of the ischemiclimb. If we can augment the anti-apoptosis capacity of EPCs tooxidative stress before the injection, the effects of therapeuticangiogenesis may be more desirable. Therefore, we tried in thisstudy to find out how we could augment the anti-apoptosiscapacity of EPCs in response to oxidative stress. Brunet et al.reported that apoptosis of human epithelial cells was suppressed byinactivation of forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) [16].Nemoto et al. reported that FOXO was activated by reactiveoxygen species (ROS) [17]. In EPCs, Urbich et al. reported thatFOXO4, but not FOXO1 and FOXO3a, played a pivotal role ina signaling of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [18]. Accordingly,we transfected small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted againstFOXO4 of EPCs to generate FOXO4-knockdown EPCs (FOX-O4KD-EPCs) and examined whether FOXO4KD-EPCs gainedresistance to apoptosis in response to oxidative stress in vitro. InPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92626http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/addition, we assessed whether intramuscular injection of FOX-O4KD-EPCs to the rat ischemic limbs could augment neovascu-larization though the augmented anti-apoptosis capacity toischemia-induced oxidative stress.Materials and MethodsEPC CultureWe first obtained written informed consent by documentationfor this study and then collected peripheral blood from healthyvolunteers and coronary artery disease patients with more thantwo of the following atherosclerotic risk factors: age .65 years,current smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Thisstudy conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration ofHelsinki and was approved by the Committees on the EthicsReview Board of Kurume University School of Medicine. Wegenerated EPCs from peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells(PB-MNCs), as we and others previously reported [9,19]. In brief,PB-MNCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation withFicoll (Ficoll-Paque PLUS, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) andseeded onto a plate coated with fibronectin (Sigma) and culturedin endothelial basal medium with supplements (EBM-2 BulletKit,Clonetics) and 20% fatal bovine serum (FBS) for 4 days at 37uC,5% CO2, in a humidified incubator.EPC Apoptosis AssayWe assessed apoptosis of EPCs in vitro and in vivo using theterminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. First, weassessed apoptosis of EPCs subjected to malnutrition stress,hypoxic stress, or oxidative stress in vitro. We incubated EPCswith serum-free culture medium, with hypoxic chamber (O2 1.0%;CO2 5.0%, N2; 94%; APM-30DR, ASTEC), or with 1 mMhydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-added culture medium for 18 h at37uC. H2O2 was used experimentally as the chemical agent ofexogenous oxidative stress [18]. The cells were detached from theculture plates, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 1%paraformaldehyde. TUNEL-positive cells were stained with anFigure 1. Apoptosis of EPCs subjected to cytotoxic conditionin vitro.

In addition, another apoptosisdetection kit (APO-DIRECTTM Kit, BD Biosciences) was usedto analyze TUNEL-positive cells using flow cytometry (FACS-Canto II, Becton Dickinson). These staining procedures wereperformed according to the respective manufacturers\u2019 instructions.The flow cytometric analysis was performed with softwaresupplied by the manufacturer (FACSDiva, Becton Dickinson).Second, we assessed apoptosis of EPCs injected into the ratischemic limbs. We labeled EPCs with a fluorescent red reagentDil (CellTracker CM-Dil C7000, Invitrogen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions and injected a total of 50 mLphosphate buffered saline (PBS) with or without EPCs (56105cells per rat) into five equally-spaced points on the ischemic andnon-ischemic adductor muscles 2 h after the surgery of hindlimbischemia. We harvested the tissues of the ischemic and non-ischemic adductor muscles 24 h after the injection of EPCs andfixed 5-mm frozen sections of the tissues with 2% paraformalde-hyde for 10 min at room temperature. TUNEL-positive cells inthe tissues were stained with an apoptosis detection kit (In Situ CellDeath Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Roche) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions. We counted the numbers of TU-NEL-positive and TUNEL-negative EPCs in 10 randomly selectedhigh-power fields (6400) with a fluorescence microscope (BX50,OLYMPUS) and divided the number of TUNEL-positive EPCsby the total number of EPCs to calculate the apoptosis ratio for theinjected EPCs.Western BlottingWe harvested EPCs and thigh tissues from the culture plate andrat ischemic limbs, respectively. Then, we lysed them with a buffer(0.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5.0 M NaCl, 10% Triton X-100, 10%glycerol, 0.2 M Na3VO4, 0.5 M NaF, 0.1 M NaPP). Twentymicrograms of protein per sample was electrophoresed on apolyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE Novex 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel,Invitrogen), and the protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidenedifluoride membrane (iBlot Gel Transfer Stacks, Invitrogen). Themembrane was blocked with a buffer (Blocking One, Nacalaiand H2O2-treated-EPCs. EPCs were derived from atheroscleroticpatients.

Themembrane was then washed twice with TBS-Tween andadditionally incubated with a corresponding horseradish peroxi-dase-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 60 min atroom temperature. The antigen-antibody complex signal wasoptically detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system(SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, ThermoScientific), and the signal density was determined with imageanalysis computer software (Multi Gauge v3.0, Fuji Film). b-actinor GAPDH was used as a control protein. Calculated densitieswere expressed as FOXO3a/b-actin, FOXO4/b-actin, Bim/b-actin, cleaved caspase-3/b-actin, VEGF/GAPDH, b-FGF/GAPDH, SDF-1/GAPDH, and IGF-1/GAPDH density ratios.siRNA Transfection of EPCsWe detached EPCs from the fibronectin-coated culture platewith trypsin (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen), re-suspended themwith the serum-free medium, and re-seeded them onto a platecoated with carboxyl (BD Pure Coat Carboxyl, BD Biosciences) toavoid mixing of fibronectin into the sample of EPCs for westernblot analysis.

The expressions of the antigens wereanalyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, Becton Dickinson)[9,19].Hindlimb Ischemia Animal ModelWe assessed oxidative stress and neovascularization of ischemiclimbs using a unilateral hindlimb ischemia animal model with 8-to-12-week-old athymic nude rats (F344/N-rnu/rnu, CLEA JapanInc.) [19]. The proximal portion of the femoral artery and thedistal portion of the saphenous artery were occluded using anelectrical coagulator (Vetroson V-10 bi-polar electrosurgical unit,Summit Hill Laboratories), and the overlying skin was closed usingnylon sutures. The investigation conformed to the Guide for the Careand Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutesof Health. The study protocol was approved by the InstitutionalAnimal Care and use Committee of Kurume University School ofMedicine. All procedures for rats were performed under anesthesiawith isoflurane (5% in 100% oxygen for induction, 1\u20132% in 100%oxygen for maintenance) using an animal anesthesia apparatus(TK-5, Bio Machinery). Depth of anesthesia was monitored by thetoe pinch reflex test.ROS Production AssayTo assess the oxidative stress of rat ischemic limbs, we analyzedthe generation of ROS in the limbs. At 14 days after the hindlimbischemia induction, the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocationafter anesthesia with isoflurane, and the tissues of the ischemic andnon-ischemic adductor muscles were harvested. We made 5-mmfrozen sections of the tissues and incubated them with 2 mmol/Ldihydroethidium (DHE) (Invitrogen), which is a probe to detectROS production, for 30 min at 37uC in the dark. The DHEstaining of the section was assessed in 5 randomly selected high-power fields (6200) under a fluorescence microscope (BX50,OLYMPUS). The DHE fluorescence intensity was quantified withimage analysis computer software (Image-Pro Plus 6.2J, MediaCybernetics, Inc.).Limb Perfusion MeasurementAt 14 days after the intramuscular injection of PBS with orwithout EPCs (56105 cells per rat) to the rat ischemic limb, wedetermined the blood flow of the rat ischemic and non-ischemiclimbs with a laser Doppler blood flow imager (moorLDI-Mark 2,Moor Instruments Ltd.). Before scanning of the blood flow, ratswere placed on a heating pad (FHP-300S, TGK) at 37uC tominimize variations in temperature. The mean of laser Dopplerflux was analyzed on both limbs with software supplied by themanufacturer. To avoid variables due to ambient light andtemperature, the calculated blood perfusion was expressed as theischemic/non-ischemic hindlimb blood flow ratio [9,19].Capillary Density AnalysisFor histological assessment of neovascularization of the ratischemic limb intramuscularly injected PBS with or without EPCs,we analyzed the capillary density in five-mm frozen sections of theischemic adductor muscles at 14 days after the injection. Capillaryendothelial cells were stained with CD31 monoclonal antibodyFOXO4, BimEL, and cleaved caspase-3 in EPCs.

The numbers of CD31-positivecapillaries (,20 mm), Dil-positive cells, and myofibers in 10randomly selected high-power fields (6200) of the same traversesections were counted with a fluorescence microscope (BX50,OLYMPUS). We divided the number of CD31-positive capillariesby the number of myofibers to calculate the CD31-positivecapillary density [9,19].EPCs Incorporation AnalysisFor histological assessment of human-derived EPCs incorpora-tion in endothelial cells of rat ischemic limbs with the intramus-cular injection of the EPCs, we stained 5-mm frozen sections of therat ischemic adductor muscles with CD31 monoclonal antibody(BD Pharmingen; labeled with Dylight549 IgG, Jackson Immu-noresearch Laboratories) and proliferative cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) monoclonal antibody (abcam; labeled with HRP IgG,Molecular Probes and Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide, Invitrogen).The CD31 antibody and PCNA antibody specifically react withhuman cells and rat cells, respectively. The numbers of PCNA-positive cells incorporated in CD31-positive endothelial cells (.10 mm) in 10 randomly selected high-power fields (6400) of thesame traverse sections were counted with a fluorescence micro-scope (BZ-9000, Keyence).EPC Secretion AssayEPCs secrete neovascularization-related cytokines [9,19,21]. Inorder to evaluate the secretion capacity of EPCs, we measured theFigure 8. Anti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivo.

In the western blotanalysis, results of the expression of FOXO3a or FOXO4 in EPCsand H2O2-treated-EPCs were analyzed with the paired Student\u2019st-test. Results of the expressions of FOXO4 in healthy volunteer-and atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs were analyzed with theStudent\u2019s t-test. Results of DHE tissue staining were also analyzedwith the Student\u2019s t-test. Other results were analyzed with one-wayANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. P values ,0.05 wereconsidered statistically significant. All analyses were performedwith SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.).ResultsApoptosis of EPCs in vitroIn atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs, the percentage ofTUNEL-positive EPCs (i.e. apoptotic EPCs) was significantlygreater for EPCs subjected to H2O2 (i.e. oxidative stress) than toserum-free medium (i.e. malnutrition stress) or to low oxygen (i.e.hypoxic stress). These results suggested high susceptibility ofatherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs for oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis (Fig. 1).FOXO Expressions in Apoptotic EPCsIn atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs, the expression ofFOXO3a in H2O2-treated EPCs was comparable to that innon-treated EPCs (Fig. 2A, B). However, the expression ofFOXO4 in H2O2-treated EPCs was significantly greater than thatin non-treated EPCs (Fig. 2A, B). These results suggested thatFOXO4 was more essential for oxidative stress-induced apoptosisof atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs than FOXO3a.Intriguingly, the expression of FOXO4 in EPCs under normalconditions was significantly greater for atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs than for healthy volunteer-derived EPCs (Fig. 2C,D). The baseline clinical characteristics of healthy volunteer- andatherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs are shown in Table 1.Moreover, the expression of FOXO4 in EPCs subjected to H2O2was augmented in atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs only(Fig. 2C, D). These results suggested again that FOXO4 wasessential for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of atheroscleroticpatient-derived EPCs.Taken together, we adopted FOXO4 to generate FOXO-knockdown EPCs gained resistance to oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis and used atherosclerotic patient-derived cells for thegeneration.athymic nude rats (left panels) and fluorescence microscopic photos ofCD31-positive endothelial capillaries in the ischemic limb (right panels)14 days after intramuscular injection of PBS, EPCs, NT-EPCs, or FOXO4KD-EPCs to the right ischemic limb.

FOXO4 expression in FOXO4 siRNA transfectedEPCs was significantly lower by 39.367.2% than that in non-transfected EPCs, indicating successful generation of FOXO4KD-EPCs (Fig. 3B).Phenotype of EPCsIn the flow cytometric analysis, the expressions of CD133,CD34, CD31, and KDR, which were reported as surface antigensof EPCs [3,9,19], were comparable among EPCs, NT-EPCs, andFOXO4KD-EPCs (Fig. 4). These results indicated that siRNAtransfection did not alter the phenotype of EPCs.Anti-apoptosis Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vitroAfter treatment of EPCs with H2O2, the number of TUNEL-positive EPCs was significantly smaller for FOXO4KD-EPCs thanfor EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 5A\u2013C). The expressions of BimELand cleaved caspase-3, which were reported as pro-apoptoticproteins of EPCs [18,22], were significantly decreased as well asthe expression of FOXO4 in FOXO4KD-EPCs treated with H2O2(Fig. 6A,B). These results suggested that anti-apoptosis capacityfor oxidative stress was augmented in FOXO4KD-EPCs.ROS Production in Athymic Nude Rat Ischemic LimbsIn the rat ischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limb tissuesstained with DHE, the fluorescence intensity of DHE wassignificantly greater for the ischemic tissues than for the non-ischemic tissues, indicating that more ROS was produced in theischemic limb than in the non-ischemic limb (Fig. 7A, B). Inaddition, the DHE expression in the ischemic limb injected EPCsor FOXO4KD-EPCs was comparable to that in the ischemic limbinjected PBS (Fig. 7C, D). These results suggested thatintramuscularly injected EPCs or FOXO4KD-EPCs did not reduceROS in the ischemic limb tissues.Anti-apoptosis Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivoAt 24 h after intramuscular injection of EPCs to the ratischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limbs, significantly moreEPCs were positive for TUNEL in the ischemic limb than in thenon-ischemic limb (Fig. 8A, B), indicating more apoptosis of theinjected EPCs in the ischemic limb than in the non-ischemic limb.However, the number of apoptotic EPCs was significantly smallerfor FOXO4KD-EPCs but not NT-EPCs in the ischemic limb(Fig. 8A, B), suggesting the augmented anti-apoptosis capacity ofFOXO4KD-EPCs in the ischemic limb.Neovascularization Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivoAt 14 days after intramuscular injection of PBS or EPCs to therat ischemic limb, the blood flow ratio and the CD31-positivecapillary density of the ischemic limb were significantly greater forthe injection of EPCs than for the injection of PBS (Fig. 9A\u2013C),which were further increased by the injection of FOXO4KD-EPCs,but not NT-EPCs (Fig. 9A\u2013C).Incorporation of EPCs in Endothelial Cells in vivoAt 60 h after intramuscular injection of human-derived EPCs inthe rat ischemic limb, human-specific proliferative cell nuclearantigens (PCNA)-positive cells, which were defined as injectedEPCs in proliferative phase, were incorporated in rat CD31-positive endothelial cells (Fig. 10A). Moreover, the number ofPCNA-positive cells incorporated in CD31-positive endothelialcells was significantly greater in the injection of FOXO4KD-EPCsthan in the injections of EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 10B). Thisresult suggested that more FOXO4KD-EPCs survived in theischemic limb tissue and were incorporated in endothelial cells ofthe tissue for augmenting neovascularization of the limb.Secretion Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCsThe concentrations of VEGF, b-FGF, IGF-1, and SDF-1asecreted from EPCs in the culture medium were comparableamong EPCs, NT-EPCs, and FOXO4KD-EPCs (Table 2),suggesting that there were no effect of FOX4-knockdown on thesecretion capacity of EPCs.Angiogenic Cytokines in Athymic Nude Rat IschemicLimbsWe examined EPC-secreted angiogenic cytokines such asVEGF, b-FGF, IGF-1, and SDF-1 in the rat ischemic limb usingwestern blot analysis. At 60 h after the EPCs injection, theexpressions of human specific VEGF, b-FGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1were greater in the injection of FOXO4KD-EPCs than in theinjections of EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 10C). These resultssuggested that more FOXO4KD-EPCs survived in the ischemicCD31-positive endothelial cells were stained red.

In this study, oxidative stress was highercytotoxic factor for EPCs than malnutrition and hypoxic stressin vitro. This result may suggest that a great number of EPCs thatare injected to the ischemic limb lose the viability due to ischemia-induced oxidative stress in the limb (Fig. 11A, B). Oxidativestress, which is caused by an imbalance between the productionand accumulation of ROS and the body\u2019s ability to manage themwith various antioxidants, was reported to be increase in ischemicskeletal muscles of human and rodent limbs [11\u201313]. In this study,the expression of DHE, which is a probe to detect ROSproduction, was greater in the ischemic limb of athymic nuderat than in the contralateral non-ischemic limb of the rat,indicating that oxidative stress was increased in the rat ischemiclimb. Moreover, at 24 h after the intramuscular injection of EPCsto the rat limb with or without ischemia, the number of apoptoticEPCs was greater in the ischemic limb than in the non-ischemiclimb. These results suggested that intramuscularly injected EPCsto the ischemic limb resulted in apoptosis partly due to oxidativestress of the limb and a great number of viable EPCs withneovascularization capacity were lost from the limb.FOXO4-knockdown Suppressed Oxidative Stress-inducedApoptosis of EPCs in vitroIt has been reported that oxidative stress activated FOXO andthe activation promoted apoptosis [16,17]. In this study, theexpression of FOXO4, but not FOXO3a, was augmented inH2O2-treated EPCs, which may suggest that oxidative stressinduces FOXO4-mediated apoptosis of EPCs. In addition,FOXO4KD-EPCs prevented oxidative stress-induced apoptosisin vitro and the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins BimEL andcleaved caspase-3 were decreased in FOXO4KD-EPCs in responseto oxidative stress. Thus, we succeeded ex vivo in generatingFOXO4KD-EPCs with augmented anti-apoptosis capacity foroxidative stress.FOXO4KD-EPCs Contributed to AugmentNeovascularization in vivoIn order to assess whether the ex vivo anti-apoptosis capacity ofFOXO4KD-EPCs could work in vivo, we intramuscularly injectedEPCs, NT-EPCs, or FOXO4KD-EPCs into the rat ischemic limband assessed neovascularization of the limb. At 24 h after the cellinjection, the number of apoptotic FOXO4KD-EPCs was signif-icantly smaller than that of apoptotic EPCs or NT-EPCs in thelimb. The the injection of EPCs or NT-EPCs increased the bloodflow and the capillary density of the rat ischemic limb more thanthe injection of PBS at 14 days, which were further increased bythe injection of FOXO4KD-EPCs. Moreover, injected EPCs inproliferative phase were incorporated in endothelial cells of thelimb tissue and the number of the EPCs was significantly greater inthe injection of FOXO4KD-EPCs than in the injections of EPCsand NT-EPCs. These results suggested that the ex vivo anti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs could work in the ratischemic limb to decrease the loss of intramuscularly injectedEPCs and to let the surviving many EPCs fully bring out theFigure 11.

Urbichet al. reported that EPCs secreted angiogenic proteins such asVEGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1 and thereby enhanced migration ofmature endothelial cells for neovascularization of the ischemictissue [21]. In this study, FOXO4-knockdown did not affect thesecretion of such angiogenic proteins. Given the augmented anti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in the ischemic limb, theamount of angiogenic proteins secreted from intramuscularlyinjected EPCs was greater for FOXO4KD-EPC-injected limb thanfor non-treated EPC-injected limb. This may be one of themechanisms of augmented neovascularization by the injection ofFOXO4KD-EPCs. Indeed, the expression of VEGF, b-FGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1 secreted from EPCs in the rat ischemic limb tissuewere greater in the injection of FOXO4KD-EPCs than in theinjections of EPCs and NT-EPCs.Urao et al. have recently reported in endothelial specificcatalase transgenic mice with hindlimb ischemia that endothelialcell-derived H2O2, which is a kind of ROS, plays a critical role inneovascularization of the ischemic limb [23]. Although we assumein this study that ischemia-induced oxidative stress plays anundesirable role in EPC-mediated neovascularization of theischemic limb, there may be the possibility that intramuscularlyinjected EPCs reduced endothelial cell-derived H2O2 in theischemic limb and thereby impaired endothelial cell-regulatedneovascularization. However, this possibility was thought to beunlikely because the expression of DHE in EPC- or FOXO4KD-EPC-injected ischemic limb tissue was comparable to that in PBS-injected ischemic limb tissue. Thus, FOXO4KD-EPCs injection tothe ischemic limb did not affect neovascularization regulated bythe endothelial cell-derived ROS but contributed to augmentEPC-mediated neovascularization by the decrease of oxidativestress-induced apoptosis of EPCs.Study LimitationsThere were several limitations in this study. First, we usedEPCs, but not MNCs, in this study. Further, EPCs were generatedfrom PB-MNCs, but not from BM-MNCs. FOXO4-knockdown inBM-MNCs should be examined in our future study. Second, wedid not directly examine the activation of FOXO4 (e.g. theexpression of phosphorylated FOXO4) in apoptotic EPCs butindirectly assessed the activation by expressions of BimEL andcleaved caspasse-3. Third, we assessed the in vivo neovasculariza-tion capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in the ischemic limbs of ratswithout atherosclerotic risk factors. It has been reported thathindlimb ischemia induction in rodents with atherosclerotic riskfactors further increased oxidative stress in the plasma andischemic limb tissue [24\u201326]. Accordingly, in the ischemic limbs ofrodents with atherosclerotic risk factors we may not be able toobtain the same neovascularization by FOXO4KD-EPCs as we didin this study. Forth, we did not perform this study using healthyvolunteer-derived FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivo. Although the expres-sion of FOXO4 in EPCs subjected to H2O2 in vitro was augmentedin atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs only, future studies arerequired to examine if the in vivo neovascularization capacity ofhealthy volunteer-derived EPCs was augmented by FOXO4-knockdown of the cells as observed in atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs. However, most critical limb ischemia patientsundergoing therapeutic angiogenesis have several atheroscleroticrisk factors and the patient-derived cells are actually used in thetherapy, suggesting an appropriate use of atherosclerotic patient-derived cells for this study. Fifth, we were not able to examine theanti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivo in several timepoints after intramuscular injection to the rat ischemic limb,because we were not able to find any TUNEL-positive EPCs in thelimb 72 h after the injection of Dil-labeled EPCs (data not shown),suggesting that apoptotic EPCs in the limb might be phagocytizedby cells such as macrophages within 72 h of the injection. Thus, itmay be difficult to study the anti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs after 24 h of the injection to ischemic tissues. Sixth, we haveperformed this study using hydrogen peroxide, but not otherstimulators. Future studies are required to examine if otherstimulators and transcriptional regulators, which were induced byhypoxic condition in the rat ischemic limb, related to apoptosis ofEPCs. We do not consider that hydrogen peroxide is the mainsource to induce apoptosis of EPCs intramuscularly injected in theischemic limb.ConclusionFOXO4KD-EPCs gained resistance to oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis in the ischemic limb, resulting in decrease of the loss ofworkable EPCs for neovascularization of the limb. Intramuscularinjection of FOXO4KD-EPCs may be a promising therapeuticstrategy for patients with critical limb ischemia.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Kimiko Kimura, Miho Kogure, and Miyuki Nishigata in thecardiovascular research institute, Kurume University for their excellenttechnical support in the flow cytometry, western blotting, ELISA, andtissue staining.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: KS.
