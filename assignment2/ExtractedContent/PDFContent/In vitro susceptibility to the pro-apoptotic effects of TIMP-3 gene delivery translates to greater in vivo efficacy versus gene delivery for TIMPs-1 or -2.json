TIMP-3was initially identified as a potent inhibitor of MMPs, however it also has several properties thatare unique and not related to its ability to abrogate MMPs. We studied the effects of overex-pression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) on lung cancer cells and exploredthe mechanisms involved in apoptosis-induction in susceptible cells and subsequently, the ther-apeutic effect in vivo. Overexpression of TIMP-3 resulted in apoptosis of A549 lung cancer cellsand AdCMVTIMP3 up-regulated the expression of p53, Fas ligand, TNFR1 and TNFR2 on thesecells. Adenoviral delivery of TIMP-3 gene inhibited the growth of pre-established A549 tumoursin Balb/c nude mice, and was associated with a greater therapeutic effect than either TIMP-1or -2 gene delivery. There was no evidence of increased hepatic toxicity following the deliveryof TIMP-3 either from intra-tumoural or intravenous injection. Thus, at least in cells showingin vitro susceptibility, TIMP-3 gene therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over TIMPs 1 and2. These findings establish the potential of adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP3 as a therapeuticagent for selected lung cancers.\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All\u2217 Corresponding author.

The understand-ng of the molecular basis of cancer development and theechanisms of the development of metastases has increasedhe potential targets for the development of effective anti-ancer agents. Gene-based therapies provide an ideal oppor-unity to exploit this knowledge as novel therapeutic agentsor the management of various cancers.Degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) occurss cells change their form, migrate or proliferate. Con-rolled matrix destruction is considered a key event in bothocal invasion and the development of metastasis associ-ted with tumour progression [3]. Matrix metalloproteinasesMMPs) are zinc dependent endopeptidases that regulatehe movement of cells within the ECM and also degradell of its components. They have important roles in tumourevelopment and in tumour cell survival [3,4]. MMPs arever-expressed in a number of cancers including lung can-er. This is associated with increased tumour aggressive-ess and metastatic potential [3,4]. The intricate balanceetween net extracellular matrix deposition and degrada-ion is controlled by a complex system of tightly regulatedrotease enzymes and their endogenous inhibitors, whichncludes the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)5]. It is postulated that inappropriate over-expression ofMPs or under-expression of TIMPs constitutes part of theathogenic mechanism in cancer [6]. Therapies targeted tohe processes that inhibit MMP proteolysis and ECM break-own may specifically disrupt the growth of tumour withoutltering normal tissues. The increased local expression ofpecific TIMPs, which is achievable with gene delivery mayrove a more efficient and effective mechanism for thenhibition of MMPs. Furthermore, it is now known that cer-ain TIMPs possess additional properties which may have aeneficial effect in cancer therapy beyond MMP inhibition7].TIMP-3 has several features that distinguish it from thether TIMPs. It binds tightly to the ECM following secre-ion by the cell [8]. It inhibits vascular endothelial growthactor mediated angiogenesis by blocking the binding ofEGF to VEGF receptor-2, inhibiting downstream signallingnd angiogenesis [9]. TIMP-3 also inhibits TNF-\ufffd-convertingnzyme, a member of the ADAM family (a disintegrin andetalloproteinase). This may account for its ability tonduce apoptosis [10]. It has been shown to induce apopto-is in a number of cancer cell lines [5,11,12]. It also inhibitshedding of ectodomains of cell surface receptors includingyndecan-1 and -4, L-selectin and IL-6 receptors [10,13\u201415].t is plausible that loss of TIMP-3 within tumours may abro-ate normal apoptotic programs, enhance primary tumourrowth and angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis andossibly therefore contribute to all stages of malignant pro-ression [7]. Thus, TIMP-3 gene therapy may have significantdvantages over other TIMPs.To date, less work has been done to evaluate the ther-peutic efficiency of TIMP-3 compared to TIMPs-1 and -2.revious work with TIMP-2 gene delivery has shown ther-peutic effects in animal models, whereas the effects ofIMP-1 are variable [16]. Further, not all cells lines are sus-eptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects of TIMP-3 [17].o direct comparisons of in vivo delivery of TIMP fam-ly members have been reported. In the current study wevswmuK.M. Finan et al.etermined the effects of overexpression of adenovirallyelivered TIMP-3 in susceptible lung cancer cells on prolif-ration, apoptosis and cell death in vitro, in comparison toIMPs-1 and -2. We then determined whether susceptibilityo TIMP-3-induced apoptosis translated to therapeutic gainsn vivo in over the effects seen to TIMPs-1 and 2.. Materials and methods.1.

Growth of lung cancer xenografts in nudealb/c micell experiments with mice were performed in accordanceith institutional animal care guidelines and approval of thenimal ethics board. Balb/c nude mice (4\u20146-week-old) weresed in all experiments. For in vivo experiments 1 \u00d7 106 A549ells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of micend tumours established a minimum volume of 50\u2014100 mm3.umour volume was calculated using the equation, vol-me = tumour length \u00d7 (tumour width)2/2. We injectedumours with 1 \u00d7 109 pfu of adenovirus in 50 \ufffdl PBS andontrol tumours with 50 \ufffdl PBS. Two injections on consecu-ive days were given. Tumour volumes were measured twiceeekly using callipers. For TUNEL staining and immunohis-ochemical analysis of angiogenesis, excised tumours fromuthanised animals were immediately fixed in 10% formalde-yde overnight, and then embedded in paraffin.To assess the potential liver toxicity that may develop asconsequence of adenoviral delivery of vectors we injectedhe tail veins of Balb/c nude mice with 5 \u00d7 109 pfu of aden-virus in 100 \ufffdl PBS. The animals were euthanised 72 h later;he livers were examined directly using H + E staining andnalysis of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)..11. In situ TUNEL stainingpopTag Apoptosis Detection kit (CHEMICON Internationalnc.) was used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptoticells in vivo. Briefly, after deparaffinisation, tissues wereigested with proteinase K (20 \ufffdg/ml) and endogenous per-xidase inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Subse-uently, a mixture of Digoxenin-dUTP and terminal deoxynu-leotidyl transferase enzyme was added, and samples incu-ated for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C. Anti-digoxigenin conjugate was added;olour developed with peroxidase substrate and counter-tained with methyl green (0.5%, w/v, methyl green in 0.1 Modium Acetate, pH 4.0). Specimens were mounted underlass coverslips. TUNEL positive cells were visualised byirect microscopy..12. Immunohistochemistry of tumourshe target antigen retrieval solution (S-1699, DakoCytoma-ion Pty Ltd., NSW, Australia) was used to maximise thentibody reaction. Factor VIII-R Ag (Cell Marque, AR, USA)nd Anti CD-31 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used to detecthe presence of blood vessels within the tumour sections.he fluorescent secondary antibodies used were Alexa Flour88, goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse, respectivelyMolecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Sections of tumourere prepared on polysine slides using standard re-hydrationechniques and then placed in preheated target retrievalolution according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Inhibition of tumour cell growth byverexpression of TIMP-3 delivered via adenoviruse detected the presence of TIMP-3 in the cell matrixraction of A549 lung cancer cells following infectionith AdCMVTIMP3 by Western blot analysis [5], confirm-ng the localisation of TIMP-3 to the matrix of these cells.IMP-3 was not detected in the cell matrix fractions ofither uninfected controls or cells infected with AdCMVLuc,dCMVTIMP-1 or -2. We detected the presence of TIMP-1nd -2 in conditioned media from cells transduced by theseiruses, thus confirming the functionality of all elements.e then characterised the cell lines with regard to theevels of expression of coxsackie and adenoviral receptorCAR; Fig. 1a), transducibility with an Ad vector carryinghe luciferase reporter gene (AdCMVLuc; Fig. 1b) and somef the cellular markers known to be involved in the apoptoticrocess to see if these parameters would correlate to TIMP-3usceptibility. The cell lines showed that there were differ-nces in the surface marker expression of Fas, (Fig. 1c),hereas TNF-R1 and the death receptor ligand Fas ligandxpression was detectable on less than 1% of cells for allines (not shown). The levels of intracellular p53 expressionn each of the cell lines examined varied between each of theell lines examined (Fig. 1d). To examine the effects of TIMP-on the growth of lung cancer cells we studied the adenovi-al delivery of TIMP-3 on the viability of the lung cancer cellines compared to AdCMVLuc and AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2. Usinganual cell counts and crystal violet staining there was aignificant decrease in cell numbers in the A549 cell line fol-owing infection with AdCMVTIMP-3 at 24 h until 96 h (whenll cells infected by AdCMVTIMP-3 were dead). There waso significant effect of adenovirally delivered AdCMVTIMP-1r AdCMVTIMP-2 on the growth of A549 cells. This reduc-ion in absolute cell numbers was not detected in the otherell lines examined (Fig. 2(a\u2014f)). No consistent correlationo growth inhibition and susceptibility to AdCMVTIMP-3 asetermined by baseline levels of CAR expression, viral trans-ucibility, TNFR1, Fas or Fas ligand expression was seen.In vitro susceptibility to the pro-apoptotic effects of TIMP-3 gene delivery translates to greater in vivo efficacy 277f theof tressioiFig. 1 Cell line characterisation.

Again, infection withdCMVTIMP-1 and AdCMVTIMP-2 did not differ significantlyrom the uninfected cells (Fig. 3b). All cell lines representedn Fig. 1 were also assessed for apoptosis by Annexin V andI staining. Of these other cell lines only the H1466 linehowed a consistent increase in Annexin V and PI, however,s noted this did not translate to a consistent net cell killingffect..3. Bax and Bcl2 expressionrevious studies have shown good correlation between West-rn blot (the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019) and flow cytometry for theetection of these apoptosis related proteins [21]. The ele-ation of Bax following transduction with AdCMVTIMP3 wasonsistent with the increased level of apoptosis detectedn the A549 cells. In the uninfected cells there were5.95 \u00b1 2.4% Bax positive cells, while the TIMP-3 treatedells had 36.95 \u00b1 1.06% positive cells for Bax.

Thehange in the ratio of the balance between pro-apoptoticax and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 indicates increased apoptosis.he balance changed from 0.5 in uninfected cells and 0.49n cells infected with AdCMVLuc to 2.0 in cells infected withdCMVTIMP3 (Fig. 3d).

Cell surface recognition of apoptosis.4.1. Death receptor and ligand expressionas, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 are members of the TNF super-amily of receptors. Specific ligand binding activates deatheceptors and subsequently, the downstream signalling thatauses cell death. Multiple caspase pathways are recruitedy activated TNF receptors [22]. TNF-R1 has been showno direct its signalling toward either transcription or apop-osis [23]. Although TNF-R2 does not have a death recep-or domain, it may also have a role in apoptosis throughNF-R1 [24,25] activation. The expression of TNF-R1 onells infected with AdCMVTIMP3 was 3.64 \u00b1 0.67%, com-ared with 0.21 \u00b1 0.15% in uninfected cells and 0.9 \u00b1 0.5%n cells infected with AdCMVLuc. These levels are lowut there is a significant increase (p < 0.004) followingdCMVTIMP3 infection (Fig. 4a). The expression of Fas lig-nd following AdCMVTIMP3 infection was 4.66 \u00b1 1.07%. Inninfected cells the expression was 0.62 \u00b1 0.21%, AdCMVLuc.31 \u00b1 0.43%, AdCMVTIMP1 0.71 \u00b1 0.22% and AdCMVTIMP2.08 \u00b1 0.35%. There is a small but significant increase inhe expression of Fas ligand following delivery of TIMP-to the A549 cells (p < 0.004) (Fig. 4b). Expression ofNF-R2 on TIMP-3 infected cells was 3.41 \u00b1 0.37%, com-ared with uninfected controls 1.04 \u00b1 0.05% and AdCMVLuciral controls 1.54 \u00b1 0.27%. As anticipated this expres-ion is low but detectable (Fig. 4c). Metalloproteinasesave significant role in the regulation of the cytoxicityf Fas ligand [26]. Inhibition of MMPs via TIMPs woulde expected to have significant effects on the activa-ion of the TNFR family and influence the regulation ofiverse cell systems including those involved in cell pro-iferation [27].

We thus proceededto p53 inhibition studies in an effort to determine whetherchanges in p53 function were involved in TIMP-3 mediatedapoptosis.3.5. Inhibitory experimentsWe conducted inhibitory experiments to determine the rel-ative roles of Fas, caspase and p53 in the apoptotic processinitiated by TIMP-3. As previously discussed TIMP-3 has beenshown to act via a Fas death domain dependent Type IIapoptotic pathway in melanoma cells [29]. The caspases arecentral to the development of apoptosis initiated by boththe intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The demonstrationof active caspases in cells transfected with TIMP-3 is con-sistent with involvement of the caspases in the apoptoticprocess initiated by TIMP-3. The addition of the pan-caspaseinhibitor Z-VAD to the cells infected with TIMP-3 inhibitedthe development of apoptosis up to 72 h, thus confirmingthe pivotal role of caspases in the TIMP-3 apoptotic process(Fig. 5a).The Fas inhibitor ZB-4 is a neutralising monoclonal anti-body to Fas receptor that inhibits Fas receptor-mediatedtsgif TIMP-3 on A549 cells and (c) the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-\ufffd (p-a)oes not significantly affect apoptosis induced by TIMP-3.poptosis. As expected A549 cells developed apoptosisollowing infection with TIMP-3 (65.1 \u00b1 2.8% positive fornnexin V and PI staining). There was no toxicity associ-ted with the addition of ZB-4 to uninfected cells comparedo the standard viral control (18.07 \u00b1 3.7% v 14.7 \u00b1 2.7%).owever, the addition of ZB-4 to the TIMP-3 treated cellsnhibited the development of apoptosis. Only 17.69 \u00b1 2.5%f these cells were positive for Annexin V and PI stain-ng. This confirms the role of the Fas death receptor inhe transformation of the extrinsic apoptotic signal to thectivation of DISC and subsequent caspase activation fol-owing transduction of A549 cells with adenoviral TIMP-3Fig. 5b).The p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\ufffd is a reversible inhibitorf p53 mediated apoptosis. It improves cell survival afterenotoxic stresses. The effect of the UV light on the A549ells was as anticipated. It caused almost 80% of the cellso become apoptotic. Following the addition of the p53nhibitor, the number of cells induced by UV light to undergopoptosis was reduced by half. TIMP-3 initiated apoptosis in5.1 \u00b1 2.8% of cells and the addition of the p53 inhibitor didosis (Fig. 5c). The controls of uninfected and AdCMVLuchowed results consistent with previous findings. This sug-ests that the p53 pathway is not directly involved in thenitiation of apoptosis in A549 cells.K.M. Finan et al.have any significant effect on the numbers of viable cellspresent (Fig. 6b). The slightly greater killing effect seenwith the conditioned media experiment possibly reflects thegreater lead time for TIMP-3 generation in that experimentFig. 6 (a) Bystander effects of cells infected withAdCMVTIMP-3 and mixed with uninfected cells at various% of infected cells as indicated.

It is possible that factors released by TIMP--mediated cell death contributed to the net death effect,ather than TIMP-3 alone, but the key finding was that it isot necessary to achieve 100% transduction of target cellso achieve efficient cell death..7. AdCMVTIMP3 effect on subcutaneous tumoursn nude micehe effects of adenovirally delivered TIMP-3 were comparedo effects of TIMP-1, -2 and control virus AdCMVLuc. Subcu-aneous A549 tumours were injected with PBS, AdCMVLucnd AdCMVTIMP1, 2 and 3. Those tumours injected withdCMVTIMP3 showed significantly impaired growth whenompared to PBS, AdCMVLuc, AdCMVTIMP1 or AdCMVTIMP2njected tumours (Fig. 7). On completion of the tumour pro-ocol at day 35 the animals were euthanised and the tumoursnd livers extracted for examination. TUNEL analysis of theumour sections was used to identify apoptotic cells withinhe sections. Tumours injected with AdCMVTIMP3 had sig-ificantly more apoptotic cells than tumours injected withBS, AdCMVLuc and either TIMP-1 or -2 (Fig. 8-1(a\u2014e)). H&Etaining and TUNEL assay was used to assess inflammationr apoptosis in the livers of animals given tail vein injec-ions of adenoviral vectors. There were no significant dif-erences between the livers of those animals injected withdCMVTIMP3 and control animals. Serological examinationf hepatic enzymes showed that there was no significantvidence of hepatic derangement in any of the groups..8. Immunohistochemistry of the vasculatureithin the tumourse examined both Factor VIIIR-Ag and CD31 on the tumoursrom each of the treatment groups. We determined that2803.6. Bystander effect of TIMP-3For the best therapeutic efficacy, the anti-tumour effect ofany gene therapy application should ideally extend beyondthe transduced cells (\u2018\u2018bystander effect\u2019\u2019). Our vector val-idation studies had shown that TIMP-3 was detectable inthe cell-matrix rather than freely in conditioned media.We used two methods to determine the bystander effectof TIMP-3. Firstly, we infected cells then 24 h later (beforesigns of toxicity) mixed these at various ratios with unin-fected cells. Secondly, we infected cells, then waited 72 h(at which time toxicity was apparent) then took the con-ditioned medium from these and applied it to uninfectedcells. We used standard cell counting techniques to deter-mine cell numbers on completion of the protocol. The mixedcultures containing the TIMP-3 infected cells were signifi-cantly affected by the presence of TIMP-3 transduced cells.In fact almost all the cells were dead in all ratios examined(Fig. 6a). The addition of media containing 15% and 35% ofthe TIMP-3 conditioned media resulted in the death of allthe uninfected cells. The media from the parallel viral cul-tures of AdCMVLuc, AdCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 did nothere was significant expression of both Factor VIIIR-Ag andD31 on the PBS and AdCMVLuc injected tumours consis-ent with normal development of blood vessels with in theseumours.

The illustrated sectionsare taken away from areas of necrosis. The specificity ofimmunostaining was demonstrated by the absence of signalin sections processed in the absence of the primary antibodyand lack of staining seen in uninfected cells or cells infectedwith an irrelevant virus.4. DiscussionThe development of cancer therapeutics based on modula-tion of MMP activity is a rational paradigm but as yet it hasfailed to achieve significant meaningful clinical advances.Gene-based approaches for MMP inhibition using TIMPs mayhave several advantages over conventional pharmaceuti-cal approaches. The potential for high-level locoregionalexpression of the therapeutic agent and the anti-tumourproperties of the TIMPs beyond MMP inhibition offer thepotential of multifaceted therapeutic agents. A number ofdisturbances in the TIMP/MMP relative ratios have beendescribed in lung cancer [30]. High levels of MMP expres-sion are found in non-small cell carcinoma [31]. The numberof MMPs expressed tends to increase with increased tumourstage and the levels of individual MMPs tends to be higherwith advanced tumour stage [30]. Decreased TIMP-3 expres-(([aaVTIMP-2 and (e) AdCMVTIMP-3. 3(a\u2014e) CD-31 expression withinontrol, (b) PBS, (c) AdCMVTIMP-1, (d) AdCMVTIMP-2 and (e)ion at the invasive front of human colon carcinomas sug-ests that a regional loss of TIMP-3 may facilitate tumournvasion and metastasis [14]. The delivery of TIMP-3 to can-er cells would allow restoration of the MMP/TIMP balancend inhibit the effects of excessive MMP expression. TIMP-3elivery would offer other potential benefits independentf MMP inhibition such as the initiation of apoptosis and celleath in lung cancer cells, and the inhibition of angiogene-is.The evaluation of TIMPs with respect to their role in can-er has lead to potentially conflicting results [16]. TIMP-1as been associated with increased survival of lymphomaell lines. It also has been shown to confer resistance to Fasigand dependent and independent apoptosis [32]. TIMP-2as been shown to promote apoptosis in an in vivo colorec-al cancer model [33], but, protects B16 melanoma cellsrom apoptosis [34]. TIMP-4 can also instigate apoptosisn transformed cardiac fibroblasts but inhibits apoptosis inuman breast cancer cells in vitro and mammary tumoursn vivo [35]. Baker et al. [5] have previously demonstratedhat adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to melanoma cellsnd vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo inhibits invasionnd induces apoptosis. The same group also demonstratedhat gene delivery of TIMP-3 inhibited the invasion of HeLamoderately invasive cervical carcinoma cells) and HT1080fibrosarcoma cells) through artificial basement membranes18]. This phenomenon was also demonstrated by TIMPs 1nd 2 whereas the pro-apoptotic effect of TIMP-3 was uniquend was therefore the focus of the current study. Direct2cTmWttvtntggdcoac-kltiacdepaniTistmdtoob[ficas[tlmtoahhTTaSnhtfbtitif3tiTtewtpeMTightsapggtoteeiTtatIog(lavmmfoi[mt82omparisons between the TIMPs have not been reported.hus, the question remained as to which TIMP approachay ultimately prove to be the optimal anti-tumour agent.e undertook the current study to ascertain whether, inhe context of lung cancer, TIMP-3 had distinct advan-ages over TIMPs-1 and -2, whether this correlated to inivo utility. Questions of toxicity in normal organs, dueo the use of adenoviral vectors to deliver TIMP-3 haveot been addressed previously. We attempted to examinehis.TIMPs are known to have divergent effects on pro-rammed cell death [5], and the current series of investi-ations demonstrates for the first time the ability of TIMP-3elivered via an adenoviral vector to induce apoptosis andell death in vitro in lung cancer cells. We have shown thatverexpression of AdCMVTIMP3 effectively induces apoptosisnd causes cell death within 96 h of its delivery to A549 lungancer cell lines. This effect is not seen with either TIMP-1 or2. However, we found that the effect of TIMP-3-induced cellilling in vitro was rather limited, given that most of the cellines we tested were resistant to this effect. We attemptedo determine the basis for the variable susceptibility by look-ng at levels of expression of various components of thepoptosis pathway, as well as differences in the basic sus-eptibility of the lines to infection with Ad, but no consistentifferences emerged. While we assessed death receptor lev-ls and p53 levels, a more detailed analysis of functional53 status could provide more insight. Of note, A549 cellsre known to have functional p53 [28]. Nevertheless, we didot find any impact on TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis by p53nhibition. Variability in the susceptibility of tumour lines toIMP-3 has been noted by others [17]. Thus, for clinical util-ty, some method for identifying those tumours likely to beusceptible would be preferable for optimal application ofhis treatment strategy.Mitochondria and cell surface receptors mediate the twoain pathways of apoptosis [36]. The death receptors trans-uce the pro-apoptotic signal from the extracellular spaceo the intracellular environment. Fas and TNF-R1 membersf the TNF superfamily are among the best characterisedf the death receptors [37,38]. Fas ligand is also a mem-er of the TNF family and is the principle ligand for Fas39]. The binding of Fas ligand to the receptor allows theormation of death inducing signalling complex (DISC) bynducing clustering of Fas associated death domain (FADD),aspase-8 and caspase-10. This results in proteolytic cleav-ge of these caspases, release of the active proteases andubsequent activation of the downstream effector caspases37]. TNF-R2 does not contain a death domain motif but ishought to be able to signal apoptosis directly or throughigand passing to TNF-R1 [40,41]. Exposure of metastaticelanoma cell lines to TIMP-3 results in stabilisation ofhree distinct death receptors, TNF-R1, Fas and TRAIL-R1n cell surface and makes these cells more susceptible topoptosis induced by their respective ligands [14,42]. Weave shown that treatment of A549 lung cancer cells, whichave abundant expression of the Fas death receptor, withIMP-3 up-regulates the presence of Fas ligand, TNF-R1 andNF-R2 on the cell surface consistent with the significantpoptosis induced by the delivery of TIMP-3 to these cells.imilar treatments with AdCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 didot induce these changes.iFiooK.M. Finan et al.A number of pharmaceutical inhibitors of MMPs (MMPIs)ave been developed. Preclinical studies in experimen-al animal model systems demonstrated significant benefitsrom the delivery of MMPIs in the form of reduced num-er of metastases and prolonged survival [43,44], althoughhese results have not yet translated to consistent benefitsn human clinical trials. Importantly, we have shown thathe promising anti-tumour effects of TIMP-3 gene deliveryn vitro can be translated into a therapeutic effect in vivo,or susceptible cells. Delivery of intra-tumoural AdCMVTIMP-inhibits the growth of pre-established subcutaneous A549umours in Balb/c nude mice and this reduction in growths related to an increase in apoptosis within these tumours.here was no increase in toxicity as determined by both his-ological examination of livers and examination of hepaticnzymes. Concurrent analysis of Balb/c nude mice treatedith AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2 did not show evidence of a reduc-ion in growth.The anti-angiogenic effects of the TIMPs were initiallyostulated to be due to their MMP inhibitory abilities. How-ver, it has been shown that each of the TIMPs 1\u20143 haveMP independent mechanisms for inhibiting angiogenesis.IMP-1 has an influence on tumour progression through MMPnhibition, specifically MMP-9, and also by impairing angio-enesis thus restricting tumour growth and progression. Itas also been shown to inhibit microvascular cell migra-ion thus having a negative impact on tumour angiogene-is [45\u201448]. TIMP-2 has been shown to specifically inhibitngiogenesis via induction of MKP-1 leading to p38 MAPKathway inactivation [49]. TIMP-2 also inhibits the mito-enic response of human microvascular endothelial cells torowth factors [50]. There has also been significant inves-igation into the mechanisms of TIMP-3 induced inhibitionf angiogenesis. There is an effect exerted via MMP inhibi-ion which could potentially lead to a positive or negativeffect on angiogenesis. However, there is a net negativeffect seen in the presence of TIMP-3 overexpression in bothn vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro effects ofIMP-3 on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and ECube formation have been documented by Anand-Apte etl. during their investigation into the role of TIMP-3 muta-ions in the development of Sorsby\u2019s fundal dystrophy [51].t was demonstrated that TIMP-3 inhibited the chemotaxisf vascular endothelial cells toward vascular endothelialrowth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factorbFGF) and inhibited the invasion of collagen gels, capil-ary morphogenesis in vitro and also inhibited bFGF inducedngiogenesis. Spurbeck et al. [52] demonstrated that retro-iral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to murine neuroblastoma andelanoma tumour cells in vivo affected functional capillaryorphogenesis. In this model the endothelial cells did notorm functional tubules. There was decreased expressionf vascular endothelial (VE)\u2014cadherin by endothelial cellsn the presence of TIMP-3. Further, the work of Qi et al.9] demonstrated that the ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit VEGFediated angiogenesis was mediated via the inhibition ofhe binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 and the subsequentnhibition of the downstream signalling and angiogenesis.urther investigations in animal studies have shown theres a decrease in vascular endothelial-cadherin expressionn endothelial cells in the presence of increased levelsf TIMP-3. This supports the concept that TIMP-3 overex-gen[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In vitro susceptibility to the pro-apoptotic effects of TIMP-3pression leads to failure of vascular integrity in tumours[52].At present, TIMP-3 is emerging as the most attractiveanti-tumour agent. It has shown promise in animal models ofmalignant glioma and human leukaemia xenografts in mice[17,53]. It inhibits MMPs effectively, induces apoptosis intumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis [5,18,54]. It is boundto the extracellular matrix and its ability to induce an effectbeyond the transduced cell is directly related to its local-isation here [55]. Clearly however, the therapeutic utilityof TIMP-3 will not be universal, but for those tumours sus-ceptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects, therapeutic gainscan be achieved over alternate TIMPs. Further vector devel-opment to enhance efficacy might increase the therapeuticvalue of this promising agent but better understanding ofthe molecular basis of TIMP-3 susceptibility would help tobetter target this therapeutic approach.AcknowledgementsFinancial support: Grants from the Cancer Council ofAustralia, Australian Lung Foundation, Medical Researchand Compensation Foundation, National Health and Medi-cal Research Council and the University of Adelaide.
