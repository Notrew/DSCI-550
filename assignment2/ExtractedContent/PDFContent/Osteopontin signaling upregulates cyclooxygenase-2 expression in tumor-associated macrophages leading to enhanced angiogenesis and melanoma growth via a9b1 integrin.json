"Osteopontin signaling upregulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression in tumor-associated macrophages leading to enhanced angiogenesis and melanoma growth via &alpha;9&beta;1 integrinORIGINAL ARTICLEOsteopontin signaling upregulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression intumor-associated macrophages leading to enhanced angiogenesisand melanoma growth via a9b1 integrinS Kale1, R Raja1, D Thorat1, G Soundararajan1, TV Patil2 and GC Kundu1Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have multifaceted roles in tumor development, particularly linked with tumor angiogenesisand invasion, but the molecular mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. In this study, we report that lack ofosteopontin (OPN) suppresses melanoma growth in opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice and macrophages are the crucial component responsible forOPN-regulated melanoma growth. In tumor microenvironment, OPN activates macrophages and influences angiogenesis byenhancing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in an autocrine manner. Furthermore, weidentify a9b1 integrin as a functional receptor for OPN that mediates its effect and activates ERK and p38 signaling, whichultimately leads to COX-2 expression in macrophages. The major role played by OPN and PGE2 in angiogenesis are further amplifiedby upregulation of MMP-9. OPN-activated macrophages promote the migration of endothelial and cancer cells via PGE2. Thesefindings provide evidence that TAMs serve as source of key components such as OPN and COX-2-derived PGE2 and MMP-9 inmelanoma microenvironment. Clinical specimens analyses revealed that increased infiltration of OPN-positive TAMs correlate withmelanoma growth and angiogenesis. These data provide compelling evidence that OPN and COX-2 expressing macrophages areobligatory factors in melanoma growth. We conclude that OPN signaling is involved in macrophage recruitment into tumor, andour results emphasize the potential role of macrophage in modulation of tumor microenvironment via secretion of OPN, PGE2 andMMP-9, which trigger angiogenesis and melanoma growth. Thus, blockade of OPN and its regulated signaling network providesunique strategy to eradicate melanoma by manipulating TAMs.Oncogene (2014) 33, 2295\u20132306; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.184; published online 3 June 2013Keywords: osteopontin; tumor-associated macrophages; COX-2 and melanoma growthINTRODUCTIONMalignant melanoma is one of the leading causes of death amongall the cancer worldwide. During melanoma growth, there is a finetuned interaction between cancer and stromal cells, whichproduce a unique microenvironment permissive for tumor growth,metastasis and angiogenesis by secreting a wide array of growthfactors, chemokines and proteases.1\u20133 Recent reports suggest thattargeting stromal cells can reverse tumor progression.4,5 Studyingstroma\u2013tumor interaction may solve many unanswered questions,which might aid to design anti-cancer therapy.Accumulated evidences suggest that inflammatory cells areclearly not innocent bystanders in cancer, but rather have an activerole in tumor progression. Among all inflammatory cells in stroma,the most prominent subpopulation is the tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs). Upon activation, macrophages can releasevarious cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, angiogenic factors andinflammatory mediators which profoundly affect many cells intumor microenvironment that in turn support tumor growth andinvasion.6\u20138 Although multiple studies have focused on elucidatingthe role of infiltrating macrophages in angiogenesis and tumorgrowth, there has been least characterization of soluble mediatorsreleased by macrophages that initiate the phenotypic switch andits potential impact in modulating tumor microenvironment.Osteopontin (OPN) is secreted non-collagenous, sialic acid rich,chemokine-like phosphoglycoprotein with pleiotropic function.9 Itis widely expressed in various cell types including activatedimmune cells such as T cells and macrophages.10 It acts as a ligandfor integrins (avb3, avb5, avb1, a9b1 and a4b1) and CD44variants.11,12 OPN is overexpressed in various cancers and growingline of evidence suggests that it has crucial role in all the stages ofcancer.13\u201316 The role of tumor-derived OPN in cancer progressionand metastasis is extensively studied, whereas the function ofstromal OPN in this process is not well defined.Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key rate limiting enzyme involved inregulation of prostaglandin synthesis. Among all the isoforms ofCOX, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in various cancers,predominantly by stromal cells thereby promoting tumor growthand metastasis.17,18 Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an importantdownstream mediator of COX-2, stimulates angiogenesis-specificgenes and suppresses the immune system, which cooperativelyresults in cancer progression.19,20In this study, using both in vitro and in vivo models, wedemonstrate the signaling mechanism by which OPN regulatesmacrophage activation that further controls melanoma growthand angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that OPN via a9 integrinactivates p38 and ERK signaling, which ultimately augments1Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Angiogenesis and Nanomedicine Research, National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India and 2Department of Pathology, YCM Hospital, Pune, India.Correspondence: Dr GC Kundu, Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Angiogenesis and Nanomedicine Research, National Center for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, Ganeshkhind, Pune411007, India.E-mail: kundu@nccs.res.inReceived 27 November 2012; revised 28 March 2013; accepted 12 April 2013; published online 3 June 2013Oncogene (2014) 33, 2295\u20132306& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-9232/14www.nature.com/onchttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2013.184mailto:kundu@nccs.res.inhttp://www.nature.com/oncCOX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages that modulateangiogenesis and melanoma growth.RESULTSLack of expression of OPN reduces microvessel as well asmacrophage density thereby attenuates melanoma growthTo elucidate whether OPN signaling on the host side is involved inmelanoma growth, we have developed melanoma isograft inOpn\u00fe /\u00fe and Opn knockout (Opn\ufffd /\ufffd ) mice models. B16F10 cellswere injected s.c. into Opn\u00fe /\u00fe and Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice. The resultsindicated that tumor growth was significantly reduced in Opn\ufffd /\ufffdmice as compared with Opn\u00fe /\u00fe (Figure 1A, left and right panels).The results provide genetic evidence that lack of host-derived Opnsuppresses melanoma growth. To elucidate whether suppressionof tumor growth is due to decrease in angiogenesis, weinvestigated the level of angiogenesis in tumor tissue byimmunohistochemical staining with CD31. The numbers ofCD31\u00fe cells in tumor tissues were markedly reduced in Opn\ufffd /\ufffdmice (Figures 1B, a and b), suggesting the role of stromal OPN inregulating melanoma angiogenesis. Accumulating evidencessuggested the positive correlation between increased infiltrationof TAMs and high vascular grades of many tumor types.21\u201326 OPNis expressed in tumor cells as well as in macrophages.27,28 Thus,we examined macrophage infiltration in melanoma tissuesderived from Opn\u00fe /\u00fe and Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice by immuno-histochemical staining using anti-F4/80 and anti-CD11bantibodies. The infiltration of macrophages into tumor tissueswas strikingly suppressed in Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice (Figures 1B, c\u2013f).However, no significant difference in number of macrophages wasobserved in normal tissues of Opn\u00fe /\u00fe and Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice(Supplementary Figure S3a). The histopathological analyses oftumor tissues revealed that tumor generated in Opn\u00fe /\u00femiceexhibit increased immune cell infiltration, higher nuclear poly-morphism, mitotic count and enhanced vessel formation ascompared with Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice (Supplementary Figures S1A, B andTable 1). Bianchini et al.18 have shown that melanoma containedhigh percentage of COX-2-positive TAMs that can act as aneffective biomarker of melanoma growth. Accordingly, tumorsections were analyzed and it was observed that infiltration ofCOX-2-positive macrophages (F4/80 positive) was remarkablysuppressed in tumor tissue of Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice as compared withFigure 1. Lack of expression of OPN suppresses tumor growth and reduces microvessel density by attenuating the infiltration of COX-2-positive macrophages.

As PGE2 is downstream effector ofCOX-2, we further examined the serum level of PGE2 from tumorbearing Opn\u00fe /\u00fe and Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice by EIA (Figure 1E, left panel).Serum level of PGE2 in Opn\u00fe /\u00fe mice was significantly higher thanOpn\ufffd /\ufffd suggesting the involvement of COX-2 and PGE2 inmelanoma growth and angiogenesis.To further elucidate the role of COX-2 in melanoma, we studiedthe effect of COX-2 inhibitor (etoricoxib) on melanoma growth.Significant differences in tumor growth between control(Opn\u00fe /\u00fe ) and etoricoxib-treated group indicated that inhibitionof COX-2 significantly suppresses tumor growth (Figure 1C, leftand right panels). The level of angiogenesis was investigated intumor tissue by immunohistochemistry using anti-CD31 antibody.Microvessel density in tumor tissues were markedly reduced inmice supplemented with etoricoxib (Figures 1D, a and b). Theinfiltration of macrophages into tumor tissues was strikinglysuppressed in mice treated with etoricoxib as compared withcontrol (Figures 1D, c\u2013f). Also, serum level of PGE2 was significantlyreduced in etoricoxib-treated mice as compared with control(Figure 1E, right panel). Moreover, the histopathological analysisshowed less immune cell infiltration, vessel formation and mitoticfeature in tumor tissue of etoricoxib-treated mice as comparedwith control (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table 2), suggestingthat COX-2 has critical role in melanoma growth and angiogenesis.OPN and COX-2 have crucial role in regulation of macrophages-melanoma interaction in vitroTo further understand the involvement of OPN and COX-2 inmelanoma growth, we carried out in vitro co-culture experiments.Accordingly, macrophage (RAW264.7) cells were supplementedwith conditioned media (CM) of melanoma (B16F10 or A375) for24 h. The expressions of OPN and COX-2 were analyzed bywestern blot and the data revealed significant increase inexpressions of OPN and COX-2 in macrophages supplementedwith CM of melanoma (Figure 2a, upper and lower panels).Enhanced expressions of OPN and COX-2 were also detected inperitoneal macrophages (pMac) when co-cultured with melanomaunder similar condition (Supplementary Figure S3b, upper andlower panels). The PGE2 level in RAW264.7 supplemented with CMof melanoma was measured by PGE2 EIA. The results indicatedthat CM of melanoma induces PGE2 production in macrophages(Figure 2a, right panel). Increased level of PGE2 was also detectedin pMac (Supplementary Figure S3b, right panel). However, CM ofRAW264.7 does not influence the expression of OPN and COX-2 inB16F10 cells (Figure 2b). Furthermore, we found that melanomaCM had no effect on COX-2 expression in fibroblasts(Supplementary Figure S3e, lower panel). These data suggestedthat melanoma-derived factor(s) upon interaction with macro-phages augments COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Our in vivo experimental data indicated that there was increasein migration of macrophages in melanoma, whereas COX-2inhibitor reduced the infiltration of macrophages. Further tounderstand the mechanism involved in macrophage infiltration inmelanoma, we have used in vitro model system involvingco-migration of macrophages (RAW264.7) with CM of melanoma.The results revealed that CM of melanoma induces macrophagemigration and macrophages transfected with OPN or COX-2 cDNAshowed enhanced migration, whereas cells transfected with smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) specific to OPN or COX-2 significantly losttheir ability to migrate (Figure 2c, left panel). These data wereanalyzed and represented in the form of bar graph (Figure 2c,right panel). The expressions of OPN and COX-2 in thesetransfected cells were analyzed by western blot (Figure 2d, leftand right panels). The soluble mediator(s) derived from melanomaupregulates OPN and COX-2 expression, which in turn enhancedthe infiltration of macrophage towards melanoma.OPN augments COX-2 expression in macrophagesOur in vivo and in vitro experimental data suggested that theremight be inter-regulatory loop between OPN and COX-2 thatcontrols macrophage\u2013melanoma interaction. Therefore, wesought to determine whether OPN present in CM of melanomais involved in upregulation of COX-2 in macrophages. Accordingly,RAW264.7 cells were supplemented with CM of B16F10 or A375either alone or CM pre-incubated with OPN neutralizing antibody.In separate experiments, RAW264.7 cells were supplemented withCM of OPNi transfected B16F10 or A375 cells. The expression ofCOX-2 was analyzed by western blot and the data revealed thatCM of melanoma enhances COX-2 expression in macrophage andthe enhanced COX-2 expression may not be solely regulated byOPN present in melanoma but by other soluble factor (Figure 3a,upper and lower panels). To further examine the source of OPNthat regulates COX-2 expression, RAW264.7 cells were transientlytransfected with OPN siRNA and then supplemented with CM ofB16F10 and level of COX-2 was analyzed. The data indicated thatsilencing OPN in macrophages attenuate COX-2 expression uponinteraction with melanoma cells (Figure 3b, upper panel). Tofurther confirm the specificity of OPN in COX-2 regulation,peritoneal macrophages (pMac, ^) were isolated from Opn\u00fe /\u00feand Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice and supplemented with CM of B16F10 cells.The western blot analysis of COX-2 expression indicated that CMof melanoma induces COX-2 expression substantially higher inmacrophage isolated from Opn\u00fe /\u00fe mice as compared withOpn\ufffd /\ufffd , suggesting the role of macrophage-derived OPN inCOX-2 upregulation (Figure 3b, lower panel).We next sought to determine whether exogenous OPN wouldbe sufficient to increase COX-2 expression in macrophages insteadof melanoma CM. Accordingly, RAW264.7, pMac or IC21 cells weresubjected to exogenous OPN in a dose (0\u20131 mM) and time (0\u201324 h)-dependent manner. The results revealed that OPN induces COX-2expression in macrophage cells, as did melanoma CM (Figure 3c,Supplementary Figure S3c, upper and lower panels). The OPN-induced COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 and pMac was furtherconfirmed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure S3d).Table 1.

Thedata showed that OPN cDNA enhanced whereas OPN siRNAsuppressed COX-2 expression in these cells (Figure 3d, left panel).The level of PGE2 from the CM of OPN-treated RAW264.7 wasdetected by EIA and significant induction of PGE2 production byOPN was observed in these cells (Figure 3d, right panel). We havefurther demonstrated that OPN specifically induced COX-2expression in macrophages but has no effect in melanoma orfibroblast cells (Supplementary Figure S3e, upper and lowerpanels).We then examine the receptor involved in OPN-induced COX-2expression in macrophage cells. The results revealed that OPNinduces COX-2 expression through a9b1 integrin but not via CD44and avb3 integrin in a RGD-independent manner (Figure 3e,upper panel, Supplementary Figures S4a and b). The a9 integrinand CD44 expression in siRNA-transfected cells were analyzed bywestern blot (Figure 3e, lower panel, Supplementary Figure S4b,right panel). To assess whether the melanoma microenvironmentfacilitates the effect of OPN and its receptor, RAW264.7 cells wereco-cultured with CM of B16F10 and the expression of a9 integrinwas detected by immunofluorescence. We found that there wasincreased expression of a9 integrin (Supplementary Figure S4c).OPN-activated macrophages enhance endothelial cell migrationand angiogenesis via COX-2 in ICAM-dependent mannerTo explore the role of OPN-activated macrophages in angio-genesis, we performed co-migration of endothelial cells withOPN-activated macrophages. The migrated cells were counted,analyzed and represented in bar graph. The results indicated thatOPN-activated macrophages stimulate whereas macrophagespretreated with COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 or Etoricoxib) reducedendothelial cell migration (Figure 4a, left and right panels).Increased expression of ICAM either in tumor or endothelialcells correlates with tumor progression and angiogenesis.16,29 Toinvestigate whether OPN-activated macrophages induce ICAMexpression and role of ICAM on endothelial cell migration andangiogenesis, we have performed co-culture and tube formationexperiments using RAW264.7 and human umbilical veinendothelial cell (HUVEC) cells. The results revealed thatFigure 2. Co-culture and co-migration of macrophages (RAW264.7) with melanoma (B16F10 and A375) cells upregulate OPN and COX-2expression. (a) RAW264.7 cells were supplemented with CM of melanoma. Expressions of OPN and COX-2 were analyzed by western blot.Actin was used as loading control (upper and lower panels). PGE2 was estimated by EIA and represented in the form of bar graph, *P\u00bc 0.008(right panel).

Migrated cells were stained, photographed (left panel) and migration ofRAW264.7 cells in response to CM of B16F10 were quantified and represented in form of bar graph. The error bar represents s.e.m., *Po0.001versus Med; ##Po0.001 versus CM of B16F10. **Po0.005 versus CM of B16F10 (right panel). All data are representation of three experiments.(d) Expressions of OPN and COX-2 in cells transfected with their specific siRNA were analyzed by western blot. Actin was used as control(left and right panels).OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesisS Kale et al2298Oncogene (2014) 2295 \u2013 2306 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers LimitedOPN-activated macrophages augment whereas COX-2 inhibitorsor COX-2 siRNA attenuate ICAM expression (Figure 4b, upperpanel). To further examine whether PGE2 regulates ICAMexpression, we have treated HUVEC cells with PGE2 and level ofICAM was examined. The results show that PGE2 enhances ICAMexpression (Figure 4b, lower panel). We further delineate the roleof PGE2 regulated ICAM on HUVEC cell migration and the dataindicated that blocking of ICAM significantly suppressed PGE2-induced HUVEC migration (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure S4d).The tube formation results suggested that OPN-activated macro-phages enhanced and COX-2 inhibitors blocked angiogenicresponse in HUVEC cells demonstrating the role of OPN andCOX-2 in this process (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure S4e). PGE2was used as positive control.OPN-activated macrophages augment angiogenesis inchorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assayEnhanced angiogenic response by OPN-activated macrophageswas further validated by CAM assay. The length and size ofblood vessels were measured, analyzed and quantified byAngioquant software (Angioquant freeware;www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/csb/angioquant). The results indicated that CM of OPN-activatedmacrophages trigger the angiogenic activity as compared withcontrol, whereas CM of RAW264.7-treated with OPN along withCOX-2 inhibitor abolished this effect (Figures 5a\u2013c). The datasuggested that OPN triggers the pro-angiogenic activity inmacrophages. VEGF is potent angiogenic molecule reportedlyinvolved in various cancer progressions. Previously, we havereported that OPN-induced VEGF expression and VEGF-depen-dent angiogenesis in breast cancer model.15 Surprisingly, co-culture with RAW264.7 and B16F10 cells or vice-versa have noeffect of VEGF expression (Supplementary Figure S5a, upper andlower panels). Furthermore, OPN has no direct effect on VEGFexpression either in B16F10 or RAW264.7 cells (SupplementaryFigure S5b, upper and lower panels). Moreover, VEGF is notinvolved in OPN-induced COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 cells(Supplementary Figure S5c). We also examined whether OPN hasany role in M2-specific receptor, CD206 expression. Accordingly,RAW264.7 cells were treated with OPN and the results indicatethat OPN does not induce CD206 expression in these cells(Figure 6a).Figure 3. OPN upregulates COX-2 expression and COX-2-dependent PGE2 production in an autocrine manner in macrophages via a9 integrin.(a) RAW264.7 cells were supplemented with CM of melanoma (B16F10 or A375), pre-incubated with OPN neutralizing antibody (5mg/ml) andexpression of COX-2 was analyzed by western blot (upper panel).

Actin was used as loading control.(b) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with OPN siRNA (60pmol/ml) and then treated with CM of B16F10 and expressions of COX-2 and OPN wereanalyzed by western blot (upper panel). Peritoneal macrophages (pMac) isolated from Opn\u00fe /\u00fe (^\u00fe /\u00fe ) and Opn\ufffd /\ufffd (^\ufffd /\ufffd ) mice were treatedwith CM of B16F10 and COX-2 expression was analyzed by western blot (lower panel).

(d) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with OPNcDNA, OPN siRNA (60pmol/ml) or OPN siRNA-transfected cells were cotransfected with OPN cDNA or treated with human or mouse OPN. Theexpressions of COX-2 and OPN were analyzed by western blot (left panel). RAW264.7 cells were treated with OPN (0-1mM). The level of PGE2 wasestimated by EIA and represented in the form of bar graph. The error bar represents s.e.m., *Po0.05 versus control (right panel). The datarepresent three experiments exhibiting similar results. (e) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a9 integrin siRNA (40pmol/ml) or pretreatedwith RGD (10mM) or control peptide (10mM) and then treated with OPN (0.5mM) and COX-2 expression was analyzed by western blot (upperpanel). Expression of a9 integrin in cells transfected with its specific siRNA was analyzed (lower panel). Actin was used as loading control.OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesisS Kale et al2299& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2014) 2295 \u2013 2306OPN induces ERK1/2 and p38-mediated AP-1-dependent COX-2and MMP-9 expressionTo further elucidate the signaling mechanism involved in OPN-induced COX-2 expression in macrophages, we checked the effectof OPN on phosphorylation of ERK and p38 in RAW264.7 cells. Theresults indicated that OPN induces phosphorylation of ERK andp38 in these cells (Figure 6b and Supplementary Figure S5d). Todecipher the signaling mechanism involved in OPN-induced COX-2 expression, cells were treated with inhibitors of ERK (PD98059),p38 (SB203580), JNK (SP600125) and Akt (LY294002 andWortmannin) and the results revealed that OPN induces COX-2expression through ERK and p38 but not by JNK- and Akt-dependent pathway (Supplementary Figure S5e). Furthermore,OPN-induced COX-2 expression was drastically inhibited bycombination of ERK and p38 inhibitor (Figure 6c, upper panel).The data indicate that both ERK and p38 are involved in OPN-induced COX-2 expression. Moreover, inhibitors of ERK, p38 andCOX-2 dramatically suppressed OPN-induced PGE2 production inRAW264.7 cells (Figure 6c, lower panel).To delineate the role of AP-1 and its component in OPN-induced COX-2 expression in macrophages, RAW264.7 cells weretreated with OPN and levels of c-Fos and c-Jun were detected bywestern blot. The results revealed that OPN enhances expressionof c-Fos but not c-Jun (Figure 6d). The OPN-induced c-Fos nuclearlocalization was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Figure 6e).Further we investigate the role of ERK and p38 in OPN-inducedc-Fos expression and data showed that PD98059 or SB203580suppressed OPN-induced c-Fos expression as shown by immuno-fluorescence (Figure 6f, left panel). To delineate the role of AP-1 inOPN-induced COX-2 expression, RAW264.7 cells were transfectedwith Wt c-Jun, DN c-Jun or A-Fos cDNA and then treated withOPN. The data revealed that OPN-induced COX-2 expression wasFigure 4. OPN-activated macrophages trigger ICAM-dependent HUVEC migration and promote tube formation via PGE2.

After 4 h of incubation, endothelial cell tubular structure formation wasphotographed and analyzed.OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesisS Kale et al2300Oncogene (2014) 2295 \u2013 2306 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limitedfurther enhanced when cells were transfected with Wt c-Jun,whereas suppressed in cells transfected with A-Fos or DN c-Jundemonstrating the involvement of AP-1 in OPN-induced COX-2expression (Figure 6f, right panel).MMPs expression has been implicated in tumor progressionthrough enhancing angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metasta-sis.30\u201332 To further study the effect of OPN in MMP-9 expression,RAW264.7 cells were either treated with OPN or pretreated withinhibitors of ERK, p38 or COX-2 and then treated with OPN. Theexpression of MMP-9 was analyzed by western blot andzymography. The data indicate that ERK, p38 and COX-2 havesignificant role in OPN-induced MMP-9 expression in these cells(Figure 6g, left and right panels). Moreover, PGE2 enhancesMMP-9 expression (Supplementary Figure S5f).OPN-activated macrophages enhance melanoma cell migrationthrough paracrine mechanismTo explore whether OPN-activated macrophages regulate mela-noma cell migration, co-migration experiments were performed.The results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors or COX-2 siRNA blocksOPN-activated macrophages induced melanoma cell migration(Figure 7A; Supplementary Figure S6A, left and right panels). PGE2also induces melanoma cell migration (Supplementary Figure S6B,left and right panels). These data suggested that OPN-activatedmacrophages induce melanoma cell motility via COX-2/PGE2.Infiltrating macrophages in melanoma specimens are OPN andCOX-2 positive that correlates with angiogenesis and melanomagrowthWe have further extended the in vitro and animal data in humanclinical specimens. Human melanoma tissues were sectioned,stained with H&E and graded as malignant with the help of experthistopathologist. Melanoma specimens were stained with anti-bodies against OPN, COX-2, CD31 and CD68 (marker of TAMs). Thedata revealed that there was increased infiltration of macrophagesin malignant melanoma as compared with peripheral normalspecimens (Figures 7B, c and d). Immunofluorescence doublestaining confirmed the colocalization of OPN and COX-2 withCD68 and demonstrated that majority of TAMs express OPN andCOX-2 (Figures 7B and C, e and f). Expression of CD31 was alsoanalyzed by immunohistochemistry and the results showedincreased infiltration of OPN- and COX-2-positive macrophagecorrelates with enhanced angiogenesis in malignant tumor(Figures 7B, g and h). Moreover, OPN was overexpressed ininfiltrating macrophages (macrophages within tumor mass) ofmalignant melanoma. Very few OPN\u00fe TAMs were observedFigure 5. OPN-activated macrophages augment pro-angiogenic activity via COX-2 in CAM assay. (a) The CAM of fertilized white leghornchicken eggs was added with uniform-sized sterilized gelatin sponges. The sponges were loaded with 20 ml of CM from RAW264.7 cells treatedwith either OPN alone (0.5 mM) or pretreated with NS-398, Etoricoxib or vehicle control (DMSO) and then treated with OPN (0.5 mM). CAM wasphotographed in ovo with a stereomicroscope equipped with a camera. PGE2 was used as a positive control. (b, c) At day 6, the angiogenicresponse was evaluated as the length or size of vessels converging toward the sponge and angiogenic activity was quantified usingAngioquant Software.

Our study delineates thenovel mechanism where tumor-educated macrophages over-express OPN that not only favor macrophages infiltration butalso drives these cells toward an angiogenic phenotype thatfacilitates melanoma growth. Further, we demonstrate that OPNvia a9 integrin activates p38 and ERK signaling pathways whichultimately leads to COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. TheOPN-activated macrophage promotes angiogenesis via PGE2 andaugments MMP-9 expression. The clinical data suggested theincreased infiltration of OPN and COX-2-positive TAMs correlatewith enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis. In summary, ourresults highlight the crucial role of OPN-activated macrophage inmelanoma growth and further suggested that OPN-regulatedsignaling in TAMs may provide novel therapeutic strategy for thetreatment of malignant melanoma.The increased infiltration of TAMs in melanoma correlates withenhanced angiogenesis, which ultimately modulates tumorgrowth. Here, we have observed that melanoma growth wasFigure 6. OPN induces ERK1/2- and p38-dependent AP-1-mediated COX-2 expression and COX-2-dependent MMP-9 expression inmacrophages.

The error bar represents s.e.m., *Po0.001 versus Med; ##Po0.001 versus OPN (lower panel).(d) RAW264.7 cells were treated with OPN (0.5mM) in a time (0\u2013240min) -dependent manner. The expression of c-Fos and c-Jun were analyzedby western blot. Actin was used as loading control. (e) Cells were treated with OPN (0.5mM) for 0\u2013240min and nuclear localization of c-Fos wasdetected by immunofluorescence using anti-c-Fos antibody followed by stained with Cy3 (red).

All data are representation of three experiments exhibiting similar results.OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesisS Kale et al2302Oncogene (2014) 2295 \u2013 2306 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limiteddrastically suppressed in Opn\ufffd /\ufffd mice as compared with Opn\u00fe /\u00fe .In this study, we found that increased infiltration of OPN and COX-2-positive macrophages correlate with increased angiogenesisand melanoma growth. Bachmann et al.33 have shown that inmelanoma, tumor necrosis is closely associated with increasedtumor thickness and angiogenesis. Leek et al.21 havedemonstrated that increased infiltration of TAMs in necrotic areaof breast cancer correlate with angiogenesis and poor prognosis.Here, we observed enhanced tumor necrosis in melanoma tissueof Opn\u00fe /\u00fe mice. Moreover, our data also revealed that increasedinfiltration of TAMs in melanoma correlate with necrosis and otheraggressive phenotype of tumor. Moreover, in clinical specimens,we observed that infiltrating macrophages in necrotic area (hot-spot TAMs) exhibits high level of OPN expression which correlateswith enhanced angiogenesis. Taken together, the results suggestthat rapidly growing melanoma generates necrosis which in turnrecruits macrophages and these tumor-educated macrophagescontributes to angiogenesis.Role of tumor-derived OPN in various cancer progressions iswell documented but the function of macrophage-derived OPNis paradoxical as it participates in both tumorigenesis andtumoricidal activities.34\u201336 Recent reports indicate that Opn is oneof the highly upregulated gene in TAMs in various cancer.37\u201340Recently, it has been reported that OPN is overexpressed inmacrophages upon co-culture with breast cancer cells.41Furthermore, Cheng et al.42 have reported that macrophage-derived OPN restore the metastatic potential of OPN-knockdowntumor cells. Here, we observed that OPN is overexpressed inmacrophages upon co-culture with melanoma cells. Moreover, wefound that expression of OPN and COX-2 in macrophageswas significantly higher as compared with tumor cells indicatingthat TAMs may serve as major source of OPN and COX-2 intumor microenvironment. In this study, we found that OPNinduces COX-2 expression via a9b1 integrin in RGD-independentmanner.Tumor-educated macrophages regulate angiogenesis in tumormicroenvironment by secreting a wide range of factors.43 Ourresults indicated that OPN-activated RAW264.7 cells augment thesecretion of PGE2 which in turn induce endothelial cell migrationand tube formation. Furthermore, CAM assay validate this finding.Figure 7. OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma cell migration. (A) RAW264.7 cells treated with either OPN alone or pretreated withNS-398 or Etoricoxib and then treated with OPN and used in lower chamber, whereas melanoma cells were used in the upper chamber.

(D) Schematic representation of tumor-educated OPN-activated macrophages via a9 integrin regulates ERK- andp38-dependent AP-1 activation leading to enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, which in turn upregulates melanoma growthand angiogenesis.OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesisS Kale et al2303& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2014) 2295 \u2013 2306In this study, the increased expression of COX-2,MMP-9 and elevated level of PGE2 revealed that OPN-activatedmacrophages trigger the angiogenic phenotype of macrophages.Recently, Nakanishi et al.44 have shown that COX-2 inhibitionaltered TAMs phenotypes by redirecting TAMs toward M1phenotype. Moreover, Heusinkveld et al.45 have demonstratedthat tumor-derived PGE2 is responsible for differentiation ofmonocytes to M2 macrophages. Enhanced COX-2 expression andPGE2 production in OPN-activated macrophages further supportthe notion that increased expression of OPN in tumor-educatedmacrophages redirects the TAMs towards M2 phenotype.Phenotypic hallmark of M2 macrophages is due to increasedexpression of mannose receptor (CD206). We have checked theeffect of OPN on CD206 and the result indicates that OPN has noeffect on CD206 expression.In this study, we have shown that soluble mediator derivedfrom melanoma cells induces OPN and COX-2 expression therebypromoting macrophages migration. The further characterization ofsoluble factor(s) secreted by tumor cells that induced OPNexpression in macrophage is in progress. Green et al.46 haveshown that RAW264.7 macrophages promote the migration andinvasion of colon carcinoma cells. Here, we found that OPNactivates ERK and p38 pathway, which leads to COX-2-dependentPGE2 production and melanoma cell migration. TAMs express awide array of angiogenesis modulating enzymes includingMMP-9.30,31 TAMs-derived MMP-9 has been shown to be crucialfor angiogenesis in cervical carcinogenesis.32 Here, we found thatOPN induces COX-2-dependent MMP-9 expression inmacrophages suggesting that OPN-activated macrophage hascrucial role in tumor angiogenesis.In conclusion, we herein provide direct evidence that tumor-educated macrophages modulate melanoma microenvironmentvia secretion of OPN, PGE2 and MMP-9, which effectively regulatesmelanoma growth and angiogenesis. Our data indicate thatmacrophage-derived OPN educates macrophages towards cancerpromoting phenotype through upregulation of COX-2. These datasuggested that disrupting the communication between TAMs andcancer cells may redirect the macrophages function and blockadeof OPN-regulated signaling may provide means of targeting tumorgrowth and angiogenesis (Figure 7D).MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and transfectionsThe mouse macrophage (RAW264.7, IC21) and melanoma (B16F10), humanmelanoma (A375) cells were obtained from American Type CultureCollection (Manassas, VA, USA).
