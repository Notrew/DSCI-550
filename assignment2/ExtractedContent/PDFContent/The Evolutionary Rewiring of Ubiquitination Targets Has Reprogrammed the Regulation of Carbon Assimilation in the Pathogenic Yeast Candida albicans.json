Transcript profiling has suggested that Candidaalbicans, a major pathogen of humans, regulates its carbon assimilation in an analogous fashion to the model yeast Saccharomy-ces cerevisiae, repressing metabolic pathways required for the use of alterative nonpreferred carbon sources when sugars areavailable. However, we show that there is significant dislocation between the proteome and transcriptome in C. albicans. Glu-cose triggers the degradation of the ICL1 and PCK1 transcripts in C. albicans, yet isocitrate lyase (Icl1) and phosphoenolpyru-vate carboxykinase (Pck1) are stable and are retained. Indeed, numerous enzymes required for the assimilation of carboxylic andfatty acids are not degraded in response to glucose. However, when expressed in C. albicans, S. cerevisiae Icl1 (ScIcl1) is sub-jected to glucose-accelerated degradation, indicating that like S. cerevisiae, this pathogen has the molecular apparatus requiredto execute ubiquitin-dependent catabolite inactivation. C. albicans Icl1 (CaIcl1) lacks analogous ubiquitination sites and is sta-ble under these conditions, but the addition of a ubiquitination site programs glucose-accelerated degradation of CaIcl1. Also,catabolite inactivation is slowed in C. albicans ubi4 cells. Ubiquitination sites are present in gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycleenzymes from S. cerevisiae but absent from their C. albicans homologues. We conclude that evolutionary rewiring of ubiquiti-nation targets has meant that following glucose exposure, C. albicans retains key metabolic functions, allowing it to continue toassimilate alternative carbon sources. This metabolic flexibility may be critical during infection, facilitating the rapid coloniza-tion of dynamic host niches containing complex arrays of nutrients.IMPORTANCE Pathogenic microbes must assimilate a range of carbon sources to grow and colonize their hosts. Current viewsabout carbon assimilation in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans are strongly influenced by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae par-adigm in which cells faced with choices of nutrients first use energetically favorable sugars, degrading enzymes required for theassimilation of less favorable alternative carbon sources. We show that this is not the case in C. albicans because there has beensignificant evolutionary rewiring of the molecular signals that promote enzyme degradation in response to glucose. As a result,this major pathogen of humans retains enzymes required for the utilization of physiologically relevant carbon sources such aslactic acid and fatty acids, allowing it to continue to use these host nutrients even when glucose is available. This phenomenonprobably enhances efficient colonization of host niches where sugars are only transiently available.Received 5 November 2012 Accepted 13 November 2012 Published 11 December 2012Citation Sandai D, et al. 2012.

P. Brown, al.brown@abdn.ac.uk.Carbon assimilation is fundamentally important for all organ-isms. When faced with choices of carbon source, microbesoften assimilate preferred carbon sources to support the firstphase of growth and then, having exhausted these carbon sources,turn to alternative energetically less favorable carbon sources todrive subsequent phases of diauxic growth. This selective carbonutilization is reflected in the differential regulation of genes andenzymes that support the uptake and catabolism of specific carbonsources. The Escherichia coli lac operon provides a classic exampleof this, mediating lactose utilization only after the preferred car-bon source, glucose, is exhausted (1, 2). In Saccharomyces cerevi-siae, glucose limits the assimilation of alternative carbon sourcesand represses respiration under aerobic conditions, promotingfermentative metabolism (the Crabtree effect [3, 4]).S. cerevisiae is exquisitely sensitive to sugars: even glucose con-centrations as low as 0.01% trigger the major redirection of cellu-lar resources (5, 6). Glucose exerts its dramatic effects uponS. cerevisiae physiology via signaling pathways that include theglucose repression (Snf1 AMP kinase) pathway, cyclic AMP(cAMP)-protein kinase A signaling, and the sugar receptor repres-sor (Snf3-Rgt2) pathway (for reviews, see references 7 to 12). ThecAMP-protein kinase A pathway activates ribosome biogenesisRESEARCH ARTICLENovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 1mbio.asm.organd downregulates stress responses in response to glucose (13\u201316). The sugar receptor repressor pathway modulates the expres-sion of hexose transporters (9, 17, 18). Meanwhile, the glucoserepression pathway represses the transcription of genes involvedin the assimilation of alternative carbon sources, such as galactose,ethanol, and fatty acids (7, 8).These sugar signaling mechanisms comprise an interlinkednetwork rather than parallel signaling pathways (8, 10, 12, 18, 19).Furthermore, glucose regulation is imposed at multiple levels inS. cerevisiae. They include transcriptional (7\u20139), posttranscrip-tional (5, 6, 20, 21), translational (22), and posttranslationalmechanisms (23\u201328). For example, glucose represses the tran-scription of genes encoding the gluconeogenic enzymes fructose1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyki-nase (PCK1) (29, 30) and triggers the accelerated degradation ofthe FBP1 and PCK1 mRNAs (5, 20). Furthermore, glucose triggersthe phosphorylation and inactivation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1) as well as its proteolytic degradation (31).The accelerated degradation of Fbp1 is mediated by vacuolar andubiquitin-dependent mechanisms (28). Following glucose addi-tion, Fbp1 is ubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome (25,28, 32). Like Fbp1, the glyoxylate cycle enzyme, isocitrate lyase(Icl1) is also subject to catabolite inactivation in S. cerevisiae (24).This tight control of central carbon metabolism is thought to re-flect the evolution of this model yeast under conditions of \u201cfeast orfamine\u201d and to enhance the competitiveness of S. cerevisiae insugar-rich niches containing complex microflora (9).S. cerevisiae is often viewed as a paradigm for other yeasts (33).However, yeast species inhabit diverse niches and have evolvedunder contrasting selective pressures leading to differing strategiesof carbon utilization (34). For example, the major systemic fungalpathogen of humans, Candida albicans, inhabits niches that con-tain complex mixtures of carbon sources. During commensalismand mucosal infection, C. albicans colonizes the oral cavity and thegastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and during systemic infec-tion, this pathogen can thrive in the bloodstream and most inter-nal organs (35, 36). Few of these niches are rich in sugar. Bloodglucose levels range from 4 to 7 mM (0.07 to 0.13%), whereasconcentrations of about 111 mM (2%) are often used to imposeglucose repression in in vitro experiments. Many niches are rich inalternative carbon sources, such as lactate, fatty acids, and aminoacids. For example, lactic acid is found in ingested foods, is pro-duced by host metabolic activity and by lactic acid bacteria in thegastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (37), and is essential for theproliferation of Candida glabrata in the intestinal tract (38). Also,glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid \ufffd-oxidation genes are expressed inthe host and are required for the full virulence of C. albicans dur-ing systemic infections (39\u201342).Although C. albicans occupies contrasting niches fromS. cerevisiae, analogous sugar signaling pathways are thought toexist in these yeasts (33). Although there has been considerablerewiring of the regulatory circuitry that controls carbon metabo-lism (43\u201345), microarray experiments have revealed that C. albi-cans genes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbonsources are exquisitely sensitive to low concentrations of glucose(46, 47), like their orthologs in S. cerevisiae (6). However, unlikeS. cerevisiae, C. albicans continues to respire in the presence ofglucose, leading to its classification as a Crabtree-negative yeast(48).These observations create an interesting conundrum relatingto the carbon assimilation and pathogenicity of C. albicans: howcan this yeast rapidly colonize niches that contain small amountsof glucose if many of the metabolic genes required for efficientgrowth in these niches are repressed by glucose? Could glucoseregulation be relaxed at a posttranscriptional level in C. albicans,thereby facilitating simultaneous assimilation of sugars and alter-native carbon sources in vivo? We have addressed these questionsfirst by performing proteomic screens to identify proteins that areregulated in response to physiologically relevant carbon sources,revealing that gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes remainat high levels hours after glucose exposure. We then showed thatC. albicans Pck1 and Icl1 are not destabilized by glucose, in con-trast to S. cerevisiae Pck1 and Icl1, even though C. albicans hasretained the molecular apparatus to program the accelerated,ubiquitin-mediated degradation of target proteins following glu-cose exposure. C. albicans Icl1 escapes degradation following glu-cose addition, because this enzyme lacks key ubiquitination sitesrequired to target it for accelerated degradation. Our data showthat there has been significant posttranscriptional rewiring duringthe evolution of this pathogen, thereby allowing C. albicans tocontinue to assimilate alternative carbon sources in the presenceof glucose.RESULTSCarbon source has a major impact on the C. albicans proteome.Microarray studies have shown that the C. albicans transcriptomeis exquisitely sensitive to glucose and that genes involved in theassimilation of alternative carbon sources are subject to glucoserepression (46, 47). Our first aim was to establish whether thistranscriptional regulation was reflected in the C. albicans pro-teome. To test this, we grew prototrophic C. albicans NGY152 cells(see Table S1 in the supplemental material) for 20 h in minimalmedium containing glucose, lactate, oleate, or amino acids as thesole carbon source, harvested them in mid-exponential phase,prepared protein extracts, and subjected them to two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (Materials and Methods).Principal component analysis confirmed the reproducibility ofthe 2D gels from the independent replicate experiments andshowed that the carbon source had a significant impact upon theC. albicans proteome (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material).Proteins that displayed statistically significant changes in level onthe basis of three independent experiments (Fig. 1A) were identi-fied by tryptic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ion-ization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. Positiveidentifications were obtained for 206 2D gel features, representing152 different C. albicans proteins, some distinct features repre-senting isoforms of the same protein. The list of C. albicans pro-teins identified is presented in Table S2 and submitted to thePRIDE (proteomics identifications database) proteomic data re-pository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) (accession numbers 3186to 3192).The network of proteins that displayed statistically significantchanges in response to carbon source mainly comprised metabolicenzymes (Fig. 1B). Significant overlap was observed between thesets of proteins that were regulated in response to growth on lac-tate, oleate, or amino acids compared to the glucose condition.During growth on these organic acids, glycolytic enzymes weredownregulated, and enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, theglycoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and pathwaysinvolved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources wereSandai et al.2 \u00ae mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/mbio.asm.orgupregulated (Fig. 1B and 2B; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental ma-terial). For example, gluconeogenic (Pck1 and Fbp1) and tricar-boxylic acid cycle enzymes (Aco1, Kgd1, and Mdh11) displayedreduced levels, and the glycolysis-specific enzyme pyruvate kinase(Cdc19) was at elevated levels (see Fig. S2 and Table S2 in thesupplemental material) during growth on glucose compared tolactate-, oleic acid-, and amino acid-grown cells. During growthon oleate, fatty acid \ufffd-oxidation (Faa21/23/24, Fox2, Pot11, Pox4,and Tes1), glyoxylate cycle (Icl1), and additional TCA cycle en-zymes (Cit1 and Fum11) were present at elevated levels comparedto the levels in glucose-grown cells (Fig. 2; Table S2). Enzymes onmany amino acid biosynthetic pathways were downregulated dur-ing growth on amino acids (Arg5,6, Bat21, Cpa2, His1, Hom6,Ilv5, Lys12, and Met6/14/15), and this was also the case duringFIG 1 Impact of carbon source on the C. albicans proteome.

(B) Network of C. albicans proteins regulated in response to carbon source. Nodes are connectedby edges to the one or more conditions under which it was identified: upregulated \ufffd2-fold relative to growth on glucose (upward arrowhead); downregulated\ufffd2-fold (downward arrowhead). Functions that were differentially regulated on different carbon sources (rounded rectangle) have color-coded connecting lines:green for upregulated and red for downregulated. Functions regulated under all three conditions lie in three blocks in the center of the network interactions.Regulation of Carbon Utilization in C. albicansNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 3mbio.asm.orggrowth on lactate (Arg5,6, Bat21, His1, and Met6) or oleic acid(Arg5,6, Bat21, His1, and Met6) (Fig. 1; Table S2). These datalargely confirmed expectations based on our understanding ofmetabolism in other yeasts and the limited experimental data onC. albicans metabolic regulation (35, 49). The observed changes inPck1 and Icl1 levels were validated by Western blot analysis ofthese proteins following Myc tagging in C. albicans (Fig. 2A). Notethat Icl1 levels were below the limits of detection in the lactateproteome (Table S2).The levels of other types of protein were modulated in responseto carbon source. These proteins included proteins involved ingrowth and cell polarity (Arp2, Cap2, Pfy1, Cof1, Crn1, andRbp1), nuclear transport (Ntf2), DNA repair (Rad23), and pro-tein folding (Pdi1 and Cyp51) (see Table S2 in the supplementalmaterial). Interestingly, proteins involved in drug resistance(Pdr13 and Erg13) were also affected by carbon source, which isconsistent with the recent finding that carbon source affects theantifungal drug resistance of C. albicans (50). Also, a number ofstress functions were affected by carbon source (Table S2). Thelevels of Hsp70 family members (Hsp70/Ssa4, Ssa1, and Kar2)were differentially regulated in response to carbon source. TheTrx1 thioredoxin was also dramatically upregulated duringFIG 2 Effect of carbon source on central carbon metabolic enzymes in C. albicans.

(B) Effects of growth on oleic acid versus glucose on the levels of enzymesinvolved in central carbon metabolism. All enzymes shown were identified on the 2D gels. The effects of growth on oleic acid versus glucose on the levels ofenzymes are indicated as follows: white, no significant change in the levels of glucose- and oleic acid-grown cells; red, protein level significantly elevated in oleicacid-grown cells; cyan, protein level significantly elevated in glucose-grown cells.

The levels of catalase glutathione peroxidize (Gpx1)were also upregulated on lactate. These data were consistent withthe observation that host carbon source affects stress resistance inC. albicans (50).Transcript profiling data are available for the effects of glucoseon lactate-grown C. albicans cells (47). We found the correlationbetween these transcript profiling data and our proteomic data forlactate- and glucose-grown cells to be modest at best (correlationcoefficient \ufffd 0.25) (Fig. 3A). No doubt differential protein stabil-ities, alterations in posttranslational modifications, and the exis-tence of multiple 2D gel features for some proteins contributed tothis. Nevertheless, this was consistent with other comparisons oftranscriptomic and proteomic data sets, which vary considerablyin their degree of correlation (51\u201354).Differential effects of glucose on the C. albicans proteome inthe short term and longer term. Having tested the impact on theC. albicans proteome of growth on different carbon sources, weexamined the effects of glucose addition to cells growing on alter-native carbon sources. A similar experimental approach was takenexcept that C. albicans NGY152 cells were grown for 20 h to mid-exponential phase on lactate, oleate, or amino acids as the solecarbon source, and then 2% glucose was added 2 h before the cellswere harvested for proteomic analyses. Once again, proteins thatdisplayed statistically significant changes across three indepen-dent experiments (Fig. 1A) were identified by mass spectrometry(see Table S2 in the supplemental material; PRIDE accessionnumbers 3186 to 3192). Principal component analysis indicatedthat glucose addition exerted significant effects on the lactate,oleate, and amino acid proteomes and that these effects were dis-tinct from long-term growth on glucose (Fig. 1B), although sim-ilar subsets of proteins were affected (Table S2).We compared the short- and longer-term effects of glucose onthe C. albicans proteome (Fig. 3B; see Fig. S1 in the supplementalmaterial). Interestingly, the extent of correlation between theshort- and long-term changes differed for different sets of func-tionally related proteins. Glycolytic enzymes showed a strong cor-relation, generally displaying glucose induction in both the shortand longer terms (Fig. 3B). In contrast, gluconeogenic, glycoxylatecycle, TCA cycle, and fatty acid \ufffd-oxidation enzymes displayed apoor correlation. The levels of many of these enzymes were gen-erally lower in glucose-grown cells, and their levels did not declinesignificantly after exposure to glucose for 2 h (Fig. S1).Icl1 and Pck1 are not subject to catabolite inactivation inC. albicans. The apparent stability of gluconeogenic and glyoxy-late cycle enzymes following glucose exposure in C. albicans con-trasted with observations in S. cerevisiae where glucose triggerscatabolite inactivation of these enzymes (23\u201325, 31). Therefore,we examined the impact of glucose on the stability of C. albicansIcl1 and Pck1 by Western blotting of Myc-tagged versions of theseproteins (Fig. 4). C. albicans CA1395 (ICL1-Myc3) and CA1431(PCK1-Myc3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) weregrown to mid-exponential phase in medium containing lactate asthe sole carbon source, and then 2% glucose was added. Proteinextracts were prepared at various times thereafter and subjected toWestern blotting, revealing that Icl1 and Pck1 were stable follow-ing glucose addition (Fig. 4B). Similar observations were made inoleic acid-grown cells exposed to glucose (see Fig. S3 in the sup-plemental material). These data were consistent with our obser-vation that Icl1 and Pck1 are retained at high levels in C. albicanscells 2 h after glucose addition (Table S2).We then measured the stability of the corresponding mRNAsunder equivalent growth conditions by quantitative reversetranscription-PCR (qRT-PCR) relative to the internal ACT1mRNA control. The ICL1 and PCK1 mRNAs were rapidly de-graded following glucose addition to lactate-grown cells (Fig. 4B),and similar data were obtained for oleic acid-grown cells (seeFig. S3 in the supplemental material). These observations wereentirely consistent with the results of previous microarray exper-iments, suggesting that these transcripts are strongly repressed byglucose in C. albicans (46, 47). Therefore, ICL1 and PCK1 tran-scription is strongly regulated by glucose, but this regulation is notreflected in the proteome.These experiments were replicated in S. cerevisiae to excludethe possibility that the lack of catabolite inactivation in C. albicanswas an experimental artifact. S. cerevisiae DS1-W10 (ICL1-Myc9)and DS1-W20 (PCK1-HA6) (see Table S1 in the supplementalmaterial) were grown on lactate and exposed to 2% glucose, and atvarious times thereafter, Icl1 and Pck1 levels were examined byFIG 3 Comparisons of the C. albicans transcriptome and proteome. (A) TheC. albicans transcriptome and proteome display limited correlation with re-spect to the observed log fold changes between cells grown on glucose or lacticacid. The transcriptomic data were taken from reference 47, and proteomicdata were taken from Table S2 in the supplemental material. (B) Correlationbetween the short-term and long-term effects of glucose on central metabolicenzymes. Glycolytic enzymes are shown in blue. Gluconeogenic, glyoxylatecycle, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes are shown in red.Regulation of Carbon Utilization in C. albicansNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 5mbio.asm.orgWestern blotting (Fig. 4C). The Icl1 and Pck1 enzymes were stablein S. cerevisiae in the absence of glucose but were destabilizedfollowing glucose addition. Similar data were obtained for oleicacid-grown S. cerevisiae cells (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental ma-terial). These data recapitulate earlier observations (23, 24) andconfirm that these gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymesare subject to catabolite inactivation in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore,the ICL1 and PCK1 transcripts were rapidly degraded in S. cerevi-siae following glucose addition (Fig. 4C), confirming earlier re-ports to this effect (5, 6, 20). Therefore, C. albicans differs signifi-cantly from S. cerevisiae in that Icl1 and Pck1 are not subject tocatabolite inactivation in response to glucose in the pathogenicyeast.C. albicans has retained the apparatus for catabolite inacti-vation. In principle, the lack of glucose-accelerated degradation ofIcl1 and Pck1 in C. albicans could have been due to the evolution-ary loss of the catabolite inactivation apparatus in this pathogen.To test this, we asked whether S. cerevisiae Icl1 is subject toglucose-accelerated degradation in C. albicans.C. albicans strains were constructed in which the S. cerevisiaeICL1 (ScICL1) open reading frame (ORF) was expressed from theC. albicans ICL1 (CaICL1) promoter at the native ICL1 locus. Thefunctionality of three-Myc (Myc3)-tagged S. cerevisiae Icl1(ScIcl1) in C. albicans was first confirmed in DSCO2 cells (icl1/ScICL1) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), the ScICL1-Myc3 gene suppressing the growth defect of C. albicans icl1 cells onlactate, oleic acid, pyruvate, and acetate as the sole carbon source(Fig. 5A). The stability of the Myc3-tagged ScIcl1 was then exam-ined in lactate-grown C. albicans DSCO1 cells (ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3). ScIcl1 was stable in C. albicans in the absence of glucose butwas rapidly degraded following glucose addition (Fig. 5B). Theseobservations were reproducible, and analogous observations weremade in oleic acid-grown C. albicans DSCO1 cells (see Fig. S4 inthe supplemental material). We conclude that ScIcl1 is subject toglucose-accelerated degradation in C. albicans, and hence thatduring evolution C. albicans has retained the apparatus for catab-olite inactivation.In this case, has CaIcl1 lost the signal that triggers glucose-accelerated degradation? The stability of the CaIcl1-Myc3 proteinwas assayed in the S. cerevisiae strain DS4-Y40 in which the Myc3-tagged CaICL1 open reading frame was expressed from the ScICL1promoter at the native ICL1/YDR477w locus (see Table S1 in thesupplemental material). The CaIcl1-Myc3 protein was stable inlactate-grown DS4-Y40 cells and was not destabilized by glucoseaddition relative to internal loading controls (Fig. 6). Once again,these observations were reproducible, and analogous observationswere made for oleic acid-grown S. cerevisiae DS4-Y40 cells (seeFig. S4 in the supplemental material). Therefore, CaIcl1 appears tohave lost the signal that triggers glucose-accelerated degradation.Ubiquitination contributes to glucose-accelerated proteindegradation in C. albicans. Ubiquitination contributes toglucose-mediated protein destabilization in S. cerevisiae (28, 32).Therefore, we tested whether ubiquitination contributes toglucose-accelerated degradation of ScIcl1 in C. albicans. TheScICL1-Myc3 cassette was integrated at the native ICL1 locus in aC. albicans ubi4 mutant that lacks polyubiquitin. Ubiquitination issignificantly reduced in this ubi4 mutant, residual ubiquitin beingexpressed only from the UBI3 locus (55). The stability of theScIcl1-Myc3 protein in these C. albicans DSCO3 cells (ubi4/ubi4ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material])was compared to ScIcl1-Myc3 stability in DSCO1 cells (UBI4/UBI4 ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3) and the stability of the CaIcl1-Myc3protein in CA1395 cells (UBI4/UBI4 ICL1/ICL1-Myc3). ScIcl1-Myc3 and CaIcl1-Myc3 were stable in these strains during growthFIG 4 Icl1 and Pck1 protein stability and ICL1 and PCK1 mRNA turnover inC. albicans and S. cerevisiae following the addition of glucose. (A) CaIcl1-Mycand CaPck1-Myc protein levels were measured by Western blotting at varioustimes after the addition of glucose to C. albicans cells grown on lactate. (B)CaIcl1-Myc and CaPck1-Myc were quantified by Western blotting relative tothe Act1 internal control following glucose addition. Also CaICL1 andCaPCK1 mRNA levels were assayed in the same cultures by qRT-PCR andcompared to the level in the ACT1 mRNA internal control after glucose addi-tion. The relative levels of these mRNAs and proteins were expressed as apercentage of their abundance at time zero, which was set at 100%.

Similar data were obtained from two independent replicateexperiments.Sandai et al.6 \u00ae mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12mbio.asm.orgon lactate in the absence of glucose (not shown). Once again,ScIcl1-Myc3 was destabilized following glucose addition to wild-type DSCO1 cells (Fig. 7). However, ScIcl1-Myc3 was partiallystabilized in the polyubiquitin mutant, suggesting that glucose-accelerated degradation of ScIcl1 in C. albicans is at least partiallydependent upon ubiquitination. This observation was reproduc-ible in independent experiments, and furthermore, similar obser-vations were made when the same strains were grown on oleic acidrather than lactate (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Theresidual ScIcl1-Myc3 destabilization observed in lactate- or oleicacid-grown ubi4 cells could have been due either to the involve-ment of a second degradation pathway in this response (28) or tothe residual ubiquitination that is observed in the C. albicanspolyubiquitin mutant (55). We conclude that ubiquitination con-tributes to glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albicans.FIG 5 ScIcl1 is functional in C. albicans and rapidly degraded in response toglucose.

The UbPredsoftware, which was trained on 272 ubiquitination sites inS. cerevisiae, predicts ubiquitination sites based on numerousproperties of the target amino acid sequence, including the netand total charge, aromatic content, charge/hydrophobicity ratio,sequence complexity, flexibility, amphipathic moment, and in-trinsic disorder (56). The ScIcl1 and CaIcl1 proteins display strongamino acid sequence similarity (78% similarity and 67% identity).Yet while ScIcl1 contains two strong consensus ubiquitinationsites at residues 158 and 551 according to UbPred, CaIcl1 carriesno high-confidence ubiquitination targets (Fig. 8A). Therefore,we reasoned that the lack of such a ubiquitination site protectedCaIcl1 from glucose-accelerated degradation.To test this, we fused the carboxy-terminal ubiquitination sitefrom ScIcl1 onto the carboxy terminus of CaIcl1 along with aMyc3 epitope tag and then compared the stability of this CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc3 protein with control CaIcl1-Myc3 and ScIcl1-Myc3proteins in C. albicans. The stabilities of these proteins were firstmeasured in mid-exponential C. albicans CA1395 (ICL1/ICL1-Myc3), DSCO1 (ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3), and DSCO4 (ICL1/ICL1-Ubi-Myc3) cells grown on lactate. All of the proteins were stableunder these conditions (not shown). Once again, ScIcl1-Myc3 wasdestabilized following glucose addition, whereas CaIcl1-Myc3 re-mained stable (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, the CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc3 pro-tein was reproducibly destabilized following glucose addition.Furthermore, analogous observations were made in C. albicansCA1395, DSCO1, and DSCO4 cells grown on oleic acid (see Fig. S6in the supplemental material). Therefore, the addition of a ubiq-uitination site was sufficient to trigger glucose-accelerated degra-dation of the normally stable CaIcl1-Myc3 protein in C. albicans.These observations reinforced the view that C. albicans has re-tained the apparatus for glucose-accelerated protein degradationand suggested that the lack of an appropriate ubiquitination site inCaIcl1 prevents this protein from entering this degradation path-way.C. albicans continues to assimilate alternative carbonsources following glucose exposure. Is this evolutionary rewiringof ubiquitination targets between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae re-flected in the metabolic activities of these yeasts? To test this, wecompared [14C]lactate assimilation by mid-exponential C. albi-cans RM1000 and S. cerevisiae W303-1B cells that were grown onlactate in the presence and absence of glucose (Fig. 9). As expected,the presence of glucose inhibited the assimilation of [14C]lactateby S. cerevisiae. However, glucose did not inhibit [14C]lactate byC. albicans over the 4-h period examined, which was consistentwith the retention by this pathogen of glyoxylate cycle and gluco-neogenic enzymes after glucose addition. These reproducible ob-servations were reinforced by analogous data on oleic acid assim-ilation by oleic acid-grown C. albicans and S. cerevisiae cells.Glucose inhibited [3H]oleic acid assimilation in S. cerevisiaeW303-1B cells, but not in C. albicans RM1000 cells (see Fig. S7 inthe supplemental material). These data indicate that, unlikeS. cerevisiae, C. albicans continues to assimilate alternative carbonsources after exposure to glucose.FIG 8 Addition of a consensus ubiquitin site stimulates glucose-accelerateddegradation of CaICl1 in C. albicans. (A) Schematic representation illustratingthe existence of high-confidence ubiquitination sites in ScIcl1 and the lack ofsuch sites in CaIcl1 as predicted by UbPred (http://www.ubpred.org/index.html) (56). (B) The carboxy-terminal ubiquitination site from ScIcl1 wasfused to CaIcl1 to create CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc in C. albicans DSCO4 (see Table S1in the supplemental material). These cells were grown on lactate, and the levelsof CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc were assayed by Western blotting after the addition ofglucose. For controls, the stabilities of CaIcl1-Myc (CA1395) and ScIcl1-Myc(DSCO1) (gray squares) in C. albicans were compared under equivalent con-ditions. CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc, ScIcl1-Myc, and CaIcl1-Myc levels are expressed as apercentage of their abundance at time zero (which was set at 100%). Similardata were obtained from two independent replicate experiments.FIG 9 Glucose does not inhibit lactate assimilation by C. albicans. Exponen-tial C. albicans RM1000 and S. cerevisiae W303-1B cells (see Table S1 in thesupplemental material) grown on lactate were suspended in fresh mediumcontaining [14C]lactate and 2% glucose (gray bars) or with no glucose (blackbars). The assimilation of radiolabeled lactate by cells was assayed at varioustimes thereafter (Materials and Methods). Similar data were obtained fromtwo independent replicate experiments.Sandai et al.8 \u00ae mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12http://www.ubpred.org/index.htmlhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.htmlhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.htmlmbio.asm.orgDISCUSSIONThe prevailing view is that C. albicans fits the S. cerevisiae para-digm with regard to the impact of glucose upon central carbonmetabolism. This influences current thinking about nutrient ad-aptation during infection and host-fungus interactions (46, 47,57). However, this view does not resonate well with the evolutionof these yeasts in contrasting niches that differ significantly withregard to carbon source availability (40) and with an early reportthat C. albicans is a Crabtree-negative yeast (48). We now showthat, despite the similar effects that glucose exerts on the C. albi-cans and S. cerevisiae transcriptomes (46, 47), these yeasts displayfundamental differences in the effects of glucose on central meta-bolic functions and carbon assimilation. The levels of many glu-coneogenic, glyoxylate cycle, and fatty acid \ufffd-oxidation enzymesdo decline in C. albicans after protracted growth on glucose, andthe changes in the proteomic network (Fig. 1) reflect those ob-served previously during a comprehensive comparison ofexponential- and stationary-phase C. albicans cells (58). However,these enzymes are stable during short-term exposure to glucose(Fig. 2 and 4; see Table S2 in the supplemental material), and thisallows C. albicans cells to continue to assimilate alternative carbonsources even in the presence of glucose, unlike S. cerevisiae (Fig. 9).Our analyses of Icl1 and Pck1 turnover have suggested thatenzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sourcesare retained in C. albicans following glucose addition becausethese enzymes remain stable while their transcripts are degraded(Fig. 4). We show that this contrasts with S. cerevisiae cells thatdegrade these enzymes following glucose addition and their tran-scripts (Fig. 4). It is conceivable that carboxy-terminal tagging ofCaIcl1 and ScIcl1 affected their localization and stability. Never-theless, our data were consistent with the study of L\u00f3pez-Boado etal. (24) who reported that Icl1 is subject to catabolite inactivationin S. cerevisiae. We then showed that, although CaIcl1 and CaPck1are not subjected to glucose-accelerated protein degradation inC. albicans, this pathogen has retained the molecular apparatus toexecute this function, as ScIcl1 is degraded following glucose ad-dition when expressed as a functional enzyme in C. albicans(Fig. 5). Rather, CaIcl1 lacks the signal that triggers glucose-accelerated protein degradation in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 6).Ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms contribute to the cataboliteinactivation of Fbp1 in S. cerevisiae (28), and protein ubiquitina-tion is known to be important for nutrient adaptation as well asgrowth, morphogenesis, and stress responses in C. albicans (55,59\u201364). Therefore, we reasoned that ubiquitination might alsocontribute to glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albi-cans and that CaIcl1 might lack critical ubiquitination sites re-quired to target this protein for catabolite inactivation. Three ob-servations support this hypothesis. First, the inactivation ofpolyubiquitin (Ubi4) lowered the rate of ScIcl1 degradation inC. albicans (Fig. 7). ScIcl1 degradation was not completely blockedbecause the UBI3 gene would provide residual ubiquitin in C. al-bicans ubi4 cells (55, 65). Second, in silico analyses of the ScIcl1 andCaIcl1 sequences revealed that while ScIcl1 contains two high-confidence ubiquitination sites, CaIcl1 contains none (Fig. 8A)despite these proteins displaying a high degree of overall sequenceidentity (67%). Third, the addition of a carboxy-terminal ubiq-uitination site to the CaIcl1 protein was sufficient to program thisprotein for glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albicans(Fig. 8). Therefore, during the evolution of C. albicans, this patho-gen has retained the molecular apparatus that mediates glucose-accelerated protein degradation, and CaIcl1 has evolved to escapethis process.Our proteomic analyses indicate that other C. albicans en-zymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sourceslack ubiquitination sites are retained following glucose exposure(Fig. 3B; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Furthermore,our in silico comparisons have suggested that enzymes specific forgluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle lack the requisite ubiq-uitination sites required for glucose-accelerated protein degrada-tion. S. cerevisiae malate synthase (ScMls1) contains three low-confidence ubiquitination sites according to UbPred (http://www.ubpred.org/index.html) (56), whereas CaMls1 contains noputative ubiquitination sites. UbPred also predicts that bothScFbp1 and ScPck1 contain high-confidence ubiquitination sites,whereas CaFbp1 and CaPck1 do not. This was consistent with ourobservation that, following glucose addition, ScPck1 is degradedin S. cerevisiae, but CaPck1 is not degraded in C. albicans (Fig. 4).Meanwhile, our previous work has indicated that a number ofglycolytic enzymes are ubiquitinated in C. albicans (55). There-fore, significant evolutionary rewiring of ubiquitination targetsappears to have occurred in this pathogen, allowing it to assimilatealternative carbon sources in the presence of glucose, unlikeS. cerevisiae (Fig. 9).These observations have several important implications forour understanding of C. albicans as a pathogen. First, our dataindicate that under some conditions there is significant disloca-tion between the transcriptome and proteome. Microarray studieshave contributed significantly to our understanding of C. albicanspathobiology (43, 44, 46, 66\u201368), and it is frequently presumedthat changes in the transcriptome are reflected in correspondingchanges in the C. albicans proteome and physiology. In somecases, there is a good correlation between the transcriptome andproteome, for example with regard to the induction of glycolyticenzymes in response to glucose (Fig. 3) and during amino acidstarvation (54). However, this is not always the case (69), and thisstudy demonstrates clearly that caution is required in making pre-sumptions about the proteome based on the transcriptome. In-deed, this explains the conundrum as to why C. albicans is aCrabtree-negative yeast (48) even though its transcriptome is ex-quisitely sensitive to glucose (47). Thankfully, many studies pro-vide experimental confirmation of working hypotheses on the ba-sis of their microarray observations.The second important implication relates to fungal nutrientassimilation during colonization and disease progression. C. albi-cans occupies dynamic host niches that contain complex mixturesof carbon sources that change over time through a combination ofhost and fungal metabolic activities. Many niches contain mini-mal sugar concentrations (e.g., the urogenital tract), while in oth-ers, C. albicans is transiently exposed to sugars (e.g., the oral cavityand gastrointestinal tract). This opportunistic pathogen probablyevolved in niches such as these. Also, the evidence suggests that aproportion of C. albicans cells that infect internal organs activelyassimilate alternative carbon sources rather than sugars (40, 70).Furthermore, lactate assimilation is essential for the proliferationof C. glabrata in the intestine (38). Our data now suggest thattransient exposure to sugar does not prejudice the assimilation ofalternative carbon sources and, as a result, the growth of the fun-gus in these niches. This explains why both gluconeogenic andglycolytic functions can be expressed in C. albicans cells infectingRegulation of Carbon Utilization in C. albicansNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 9http://www.ubpred.org/index.htmlhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.htmlmbio.asm.orgthe kidney (40) and why mutations that block gluconeogenesis orthe glyoxylate cycle partially attenuate the virulence of C. albicans(39\u201342). Clearly, C. albicans does not conform to the S. cerevisiaeparadigm of glucose regulation, and this is important for thepathogenicity of this yeast.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and growth conditions. C. albicans and S. cerevisiae strains (seeTable S1 in the supplemental material) were grown at 30\u00b0C in minimalmedium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) containing glucose (2%) (SD), lacticacid (2%), oleic acid (0.2%), or mixed amino acids (2%) as the sole carbonsource (71).Strain construction. C. albicans strains expressing Icl1-Myc3(CA1395) or Pck1-Myc3 (CA1431) were made by PCR amplification of aMyc3-URA3 cassette and transforming these products into C. albicansRM1000 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Insertion at thecorrect locus was confirmed by diagnostic PCR, and expression of Icl1-Myc3 and Pck1-Myc3 was confirmed by Western blotting. Analogous con-trols were performed for all the following strain constructions.To replace a CaICL1 allele in C. albicans with a Myc3-tagged ScICL1open reading frame (ORF) from S. cerevisiae, the ScICL1 locus was firstMyc3 tagged by PCR amplifying the Myc3-URA3 cassette with primersDS_3F (F stands for forward) and DS_3R (R stands for reverse) (see Ta-ble S3 in the supplemental material) and transforming this cassette intoS. cerevisiae BY4743 to create strain DS3-Y30 (Table S1). The new ScICL1-Myc3-URA3 locus was then PCR amplified using primers DS_5F andDS_5R, and this CaICL1p-ScICL1-MYC3-URA3 cassette was then trans-formed into C. albicans RM1000 to create strain DSCO1 (CaICL1/CaICL1p-ScICL1-MYC3-URA3) (Table S1) and also transformed intoC. albicans CA510 to create strain DSCO1 (Caicl1/CaICL1p-ScICL1-MYC3-URA3) (Table S1).To introduce the CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3 allele into the C. albi-cans ubi4/ubi4 background (55), the CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3 cassettewas PCR amplified using the DS_5F and DS_5R primers (see Table S3 inthe supplemental material) and transformed into C. albicans DSCO tocreate strain DSCO3 (ubi4/ubi4 CaICL1/CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3)(Table S1).C. albicans DSCO4 expresses CaIcl1 with the carboxy-terminal ubiq-uitination site from ScIcl1 at its carboxy terminus (CaICL1/CaICl1-Ubi-Myc3-URA3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). This wasachieved by PCR amplifying the 3= end of the ScICL1 ORF along with theconjoined MYC3-URA3 sequences from S. cerevisiae DSCO3 cells usingthe DS_6F and DS_6Rprimers (Table S3) and transforming this CaICl1-Ubi-Myc3-URA3 cassette into C. albicans RM1000.The ScICL1 and ScPCK1 loci were epitope tagged in S. cerevisiae.ScICL1 was tagged with Myc9 at its 3= end by PCR amplification of theMYC9-NAT cassette in pYM21 (72) with primers DS_1F and DS_1R (seeTable S3 in the supplemental material) and transformation of S. cerevisiaeW303-1B to generate strain DS1-W10 (ScICL1-MYC9-NAT) (Table S1).ScPCK1 was tagged with hemagglutinin (a six-hemagglutinin tag [HA6])by PCR amplification of the HA6-KlTRP1 (KlTRP1 stands for Kluyvero-myces lactis TRP1) cassette in pYM3 (73) with primers DS_2F and DS_2R(Table S3) and transformation of S. cerevisiae W303-1B to create strainDS1-W20 (ScPCK1-HA6-KlTRP1) (Table S1).The ScICl1 ORF in S. cerevisiae BY4743 was replaced with CaICL1-Myc3 to create the S. cerevisiae strain DS4-Y40 (ScICl1-CaICL1-Myc3-URA3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The CaICL1-Myc3-URA3 ORF was PCR amplified from C. albicans CA1395 (Table S1) usingthe DS_4F and DS_4R primers (Table S3).Proteomics. Replicate cultures of C. albicans NGY152 (CAI4 contain-ing CIp10 [74]) were grown in minimal medium containing glucose(2%), lactic acid (2%), oleic acid (0.2%), or mixed amino acids (2%) asthe sole carbon source. Samples from the cultures were taken, then sub-cultured in the same medium, grown for a further 20 h, and harvested inexponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 0.8). Glucose(2%) was added to some cultures, and the cells were harvested after 2 h.Protein extracts were prepared, subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis, andstained with Coomassie blue as described previously (54). Independenttriplicate experiments were done for each growth condition. Gel featureswere compared using Phoretix 2D Expression (Nonlinear Dynamics,Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) and GeneSpring (Silicon Genet-ics, San Carlos, CA). Principal component analysis scores were plotted in3D (SIMCA-P version 11.0: Umetrics AB, Sweden). Proteins displayingstatistically significant differences in mean spot volume (P \ufffd 0.05) wereidentified by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides (54) us-ing MS-Fit and MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Protein anno-tations were from the Candida Genome Database (http://www.candidagenome.org/). The proteomic data set is available in thesupplemental material (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) and atthe PRIDE proteomic data repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) (ac-cession numbers 3186 to 3192). The carbon source network was con-structed using Cytoscape version (http://www.cytoscape.org/) (75).Western blotting. Protein extracts were subjected to Western blottingas described previously (76). Membranes were probed with a mouse anti-Myc antibody (diluted 1:10,000) (Sigma). The secondary antibody wasperoxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Signals were detected withan enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit (Amersham,United Kingdom) and quantified using a Fuji FLA-3000 imager.RNA analyses. RNA was prepared (77, 78), yields were quantifiedusing an RNA 6000 Nano assay, and RNA integrity was assessed using anAgilent 2100 bioanalyzer (79). ICL1 and PCK1 transcript levels werequantified to the internal ACT1 mRNA by qRT-PCR using primers (seeTable S3 in the supplemental material). RNA samples (2 \ufffdg) were incu-bated in 20-\ufffdl reactions with DNase I (1.5 \ufffdl), RNase OUT (1.5 \ufffdl), andDNase I buffer (2 \ufffdl) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) at room temperaturefor 15 min. cDNA was then made with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase(Invitrogen, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols.Real-time RT-PCR SYBR green (Roche, United Kingdom) was performedusing the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with a LightCycler 480 real-timePCR system (Roche).Lactate and oleic acid assimilation. Lactate and oleic acid assimila-tion was assayed by measuring the incorporation by C. albicans andS. cerevisiae of [14C]lactate and [3H]oleic acid into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Yeast cells were grown on YPLactate (2% Bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract containing 2% lactate) or YPOleic acid (2%Bacto peptone and 1% yeast extract containing 0.2% oleic acid) at 30\u00b0C toan OD600 of 1, harvested, and resuspended in 1 ml fresh prewarmed YP-Lactate or YPOleic acid. Glucose (2%) was added to half of the cells, andno glucose was added to control cells. Then, 1.85 MBq of [14C]lactic acidor 37 MBq of [3H]oleic acid was added at time zero, and samples weretaken at various times thereafter. The samples were precipitated in 5%trichloroacetic acid at 0\u00b0C, washed at 0\u00b0C in a series of solutions [(i) fresh5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1% SDS, (ii) 50% ethanol, and (iii)100% ethanol], dried, and subjected to scintillation counting (PackardBioScience). The results are means and standard deviations from tripli-cate assays. Similar results were obtained in triplicate independent exper-iments.SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALSupplemental material for this article may be found at http://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplemental.Figure S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S4, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S5, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S6, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S7, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Table S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Table S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Table S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Sandai et al.10 \u00ae mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12http://www.candidagenome.org/http://www.candidagenome.org/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/http://www.cytoscape.org/http://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplementalhttp://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplementalmbio.asm.orgACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Esperanza Lopez-Franco for help with the construction of C. al-bicans Pck1-Myc and Icl1-Myc strains.
