"pone.0092305 1..11DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors Improve the Effect ofChemotherapeutic Agents in SW48 and HT-29 ColorectalCancer CellsSylwia Flis1*, Agnieszka Gnyszka1, Krzysztof Flis21 Department of Pharmacology, National Medicines Institute, Warsaw, Poland, 2 Department of Genetics, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy ofSciences, Warsaw, PolandAbstractDNA methylation is an epigenetic phenomenon known to play an important role in the development and progression ofhuman cancer. Enzyme responsible for this process is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that maintains an alteredmethylation pattern by copying it from parent to daughter DNA strands after replication. Aberrant methylation of thepromoter regions of genes critical for normal cellular functions is potentially reversible. Therefore, inactivation of DNMT1seems to be a valuable target for the development of cancer therapies. Currently, the most popular DNMT inhibitors(DNMTi) are cytidine analogues like 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside(zebularine). In colorectal cancer, epigenetic modifications play an essential role at each step of carcinogenesis. Therefore,we have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may potentiate inhibitory effects of classicalchemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly used in colorectal cancer therapy. Here,our report shows that DNMTi can have positive interactions with standard chemotherapeutics in colorectal cancertreatment. Using pharmacological models for the drug-drug interaction analysis, we have revealed that the combination ofdecitabine with 5-FU or oxaliplatin shows the most attractive interaction (synergism), whereas the effect of zebularine incombinations with chemotherapeutics is moderate and may be depended on genetic/epigenetic background of a cell lineor secondary drug used in combination. Our results suggest that DNMTi administered in combination with standardchemotherapeutics might improve the treatment of patients with colorectal cancers.Citation: Flis S, Gnyszka A, Flis K (2014) DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors Improve the Effect of Chemotherapeutic Agents in SW48 and HT-29 Colorectal CancerCells.

It is estimated that over600000 people die from it globally each year [1]. It means thatcolorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths.Unfortunately, CRC develops for a long time without anysymptoms; therefore the disease is recognized at advanced stages.Generally, the risk of CRC increases with age and is caused notonly by genetic alterations involving oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes, but is also driven by epigenetic alterationsinvolving changes in gene expression patterns, which are notdependent on changes in the DNA sequence. One of theepigenetic events is caused by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs),which catalyze the covalent addition of the methyl group to the 59position of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide from the donor S-adenosylmethionine. Cytosine methylation occurs in genomicregions called CpG islands and it is known to alter the chromatinstructure leading to gene silencing. During colorectal cancerprogression, a global genome demethylation coupled with selectivehypermethylation of tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators andproapoptotic genes is observed [2]. Because epigenetic modifica-tions are potentially reversible, they constitute an interestingtherapeutic strategy with use of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi).Decitabine and zebularine are DNMT inhibitors, which maypotentially reverse epigenetic alterations resulting in reactivation ofsilenced genes, blocking cancer cell proliferation and/or inducingapoptosis [3,4]. Both agents seem to be very interesting andvaluable for therapy of solid tumors. Decitabine, a cytidine analog,has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for the treatment of hematological malignancies [5],whereas zebularine in comparison to other cytidine analogs ismore stable, less toxic and can be orally administered [6].It appears to be reasonable to use demethylating agents incombination with chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, encour-aging results were obtained with combination of decitabine andcarboplatin in patients with solid tumors [7]. The authorsconcluded that decitabine combines safely with carboplatin andthat the regimen causes epigenetic changes. In another phase Istudy, a combination of cisplatin with decitabine resulted in onepartial response in patient with cervical cancer and two minorresponses: one in patient with non-small-cell lung cancer and theother in patient with cervical cancer [8]. However, despite lines ofevidence indicating that demethylating agents might improvePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/anticancer activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents, theknowledge for using them for solid tumors is still insufficient andneeds to be further evaluated.Therefore, to test this hypothesis, the CRC cell line survivalmodel was chosen to study these interactions. With the help of thismodel and pharmacological analysis we have designed the study tofind out the outcome of the interaction between DNMT inhibitors,decitabine or zebularine, and classic anticancer chemotherapeuticsused in the treatment of CRC such as oxaliplatin, an inter- andintra-DNA cross-linking agent, and 5-fluorouracil, a thymidylatesynthase inhibitor. The studies of interactions between chemo-therapeutic agents and DNMTi agents seem to be reasonable,because all these compounds have been tested for their cytotoxicproperties against normal cells [5,9,10] and all of them exceptzebularine are approved by the U.S. FDA for medical use.Materials and MethodsCell culture and drug treatmentAs a model of colon cancer cells, the HT-29 and SW48 humancolorectal cancer cell lines, obtained from American Type CultureCollection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were used. The cellswere cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK)supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum(FBS, Gibco), 2 mM glutamax (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin,100 mg/ml streptomycin and 250 ng/ml amphoterycin (Gibco) at37uC in a humidified atmosphere including 5% CO2. Cells wereincubated with the drugs for 24, 48 and 72 h, but only resultsobserved following the 72 h treatment are presented as theirpositive become more pronounced.DrugsThe following drugs were studied: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),oxaliplatin, zebularine and decitabine (Sigma, St. Louis, MI,USA). The concentrations of the drugs were in the range up to100 mM. All agents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Hybri-Max (DMSO, Sigma) and then diluted in the media forexperiments. The final concentration of DMSO, without affectingcell survival, was maintained at 0.2%. In all experiments, controlcells were incubated with DMSO.MTT assayThe assay relies on the ability of viable cells to metabolicallyreduce a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan product.This reaction requires active mitochondrial reductase enzymes.Cells were grown in 96-well plates (16104 cells/200 ml/well).After incubation with the reagents, the medium was removed andthe cells were treated with 50 ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, Sigma) for 4 hat 37uC. Next, 150 ml of solubilization solution (10% sodiumdodecyl sulfate, SDS) was added and the mixture was incubated at37uC overnight. The solubilized formazan product was spectro-photometrically quantified using a microtiter plate reader, PowerWave XS (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA), at 570 nm wavelength.Analysis of drug interactionsCells of SW48 and HT-29 cell lines were simultaneouslyincubated for 72 h with chemotherapeutic agents and DNMTinhibitors or with each agent alone. The nature of the interactionsbetween drugs studied was analyzed with the help of izobologram[11] and combination-index (CI) methods, derived from themedian-effect principle of Chou and Talalay [12,13]. The dataobtained from the cytotoxicity experiments were used formathematical and quantitative evaluation of drug-drug interac-tions.Isoboles were defined by effects of the paired drugs studied. Theeffects obtained by the half maximal inhibitory concentration(IC50) of either drug within the pair formed the basis for theadditivity line; synergism or antagonism was present, when thesame effect was obtained by the combination of drugs in lower orhigher doses, respectively.A commercial software package, CalcuSyn ver. 2.0 (Biosoft,Cambridge, United Kingdom), was used for median-effectanalysis. We calculated the CI values based on the formula: CI= (D)1/(Dx)1 + (D)2/(Dx)2 for mutually exclusive drugs. In thedenominator, (Dx) is for D1 \u2018\u2018alone\u2019\u2019 that inhibits a system x%, and(Dx)2 is for D2 \u2018\u2018alone\u2019\u2019 that inhibits a system x%. In thenumerators, (D)1 + (D)2 \u2018\u2018in combination\u2019\u2019 also inhibit x%. CIvalues were generated at different effect levels (Fa, the fractionaffected by D, i.e. percentage inhibition/100) from 0.05 to 0.95 (5\u201395% cell kill). Synergy is indicated by CI values ,1, additivity byCI values = 1 and antagonism by CI values .1.Flow cytometry analysisFor cell cycle analysis the cells (,16106) were suspended in4 ml of 80% ethanol (220uC) and incubated at 220uC for 24 h,washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with50 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100 mg/ml RNase in 0.1%PBST solution (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X\u2013100) for30 min in the dark at 4uC. The samples were then measured usinga BD FACSCalibure flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,CA, USA). The DNA histograms were analyzed using ModFitsoftware (BD Biosciences).Apoptosis of the cells was measured, according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions, using an annexin V-FITC kit (BDBiosciences). The cells were collected after treatment, washedtwice with PBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended inice-cold binding buffer. The annexin V-FITC and PI solutionswere added to the cell suspension and gently mixed. The sampleswere then incubated for 15 min in the dark before flow cytometryanalysis.For immunofluorescent staining, cells were fixed in 1.5%formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) andpermeabilized with cold methanol for 20 min at 4uC. Afterwashing, cells were incubated with desire primary antibody (CellSignaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) against phospho-ATR[(P)-Ser428, Cat. No. 2853] and phospho-ATM [(P)-Ser1981,Cat. No. 5883] at 1:100 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT.After washing with PBS, appropriate secondary antibody conju-gated with FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)were added at 1:500 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS and incubated for30 min at RT. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flowcytometry.For all applications 10,000 events per sample were analyzed byfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).Semi-quantitative RT-PCRThe mRNA levels of CCNE1, ATM and GAPDH were analyzedby RT-PCR using total RNA from HT-29 and SW48 cells isolatedusing the GenEluteTMMammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit(Sigma), as described by the manufacturer. One hundred ng oftotal RNA was used in the reverse transcription reaction withOmniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)and oligo (dT)18 primer (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The PCRamplifications were performed in a 50 ml total volume accordingto manufacturer\u2019s instruction using HotStarTaq Master Mix(Qiagen), 3 ml of cDNA as a template and the following primersDNMTi Improve the Effect of CytostaticsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305pairs: CCNE1 (5\u2019-AACTCAACGTGCAAGCCTCG-3\u2019, 5\u2019-CAT-CTCCTGAACAAGCTCCA-3\u2019), ATM (5\u2019-GCCTTGAGTCT-GTGTATTCG-3\u2019, 5\u2019-CCACTCAGAGACTCCACAGC-3\u2019) andGAPDH (5\u2019-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3\u2019, 5\u2019-TGGTCA-TGAGTCCTTCCACG-3\u2019). The GAPDH mRNA levels wereused as internal controls. The amplified fragments were separatedon 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide andphotographed under UV light.Preparation of protein lysates and Western blottingThe cells were washed with cold PBS buffer and then proteinsfrom five cellular compartments were isolated using the Subcel-lular Protein and Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Pierce,Rockford, IL, USA). Protein concentration in the samples wasmeasured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples containing60 mg of protein were denatured and fractionated by 7, 12 or 15%SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferredonto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-humanantibodies specific to: cyclin A1 and D1, PARP, caspase-3 and -8(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p21 (Cat. No. 554228), p53 (Cat.No. 610183), Bax (Cat. No. 610982, BD Biosciences); b-actin(Cat. No. A1978, Sigma); and the DNA Damage AntibodySampler Kit (phospho-Chk1 [(P)-Ser296], phospho-Chk2 [(P)-Thr68], phospho-histone H2A.X [cH2A.X, (P)-Ser139], phospho-p53 [(P)-Ser15], and phospho-BRCA1 [(P)-Ser1524]; Cat.No. 9947; Cell Signaling Technology). All antibodies in theDNA Damage Antibody Sampler Kit recognize their targetsproteins only when modified at the indicated sites. Therefore,antibodies against unmodified proteins were not used.Anti-Bax antibody recognizes human Bax-a form. An alterna-tive splicing of Bax pre-mRNA produces the integral membraneform Bax-a and the two cytosolic forms b and c. This antibody isrecommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis. Anti-p53 antibody recognizes the C terminal region of the protein (the195\u2013393 a.a. was used as an antigen) and is able to recognize boththe wild-type and R273H forms of p53. This antibody is alsorecommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis.The signal on blots was detected by a colorimetric method usingthe CN/DAB Substrate Kit (Pierce) and SignalBoost Immunore-action Enhancer Kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA).Mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) measurementThe DYm was measured by flow cytometry using 10 mg/ml of5,59,6,69-tetrachloro-1,19,3,39-tetraethylbenzimidazolo- carbocya-nine iodide (JC-1 dye, Sigma), which stains mitochondria in livingcells. In healthy cells, the dye accumulates in mitochondria,forming aggregates that emit red fluorescence, while in apoptoticcells the dye remains in monomeric form in cytoplasm and emitsgreen fluorescence. Cells were treated with chemotherapeutics,DNMT inhibitors or their combinations for 72 h and stained asdescribed by Mahyar-Roemer et al. [14] and then examined byFACSCalibure flow cytometer. Mitochondria containing red JC-1aggregates in healthy cells were detectable in FL2 channel, whilegreen JC-1 monomers in apoptotic cells were detectable in FL1channel.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean values 6SD. Statistical compar-isons among groups were performed by Student\u2019s t-test or one-wayanalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test.Significance was assumed at P , 0.05 (marked with asterisks ongraphs).ResultsGrowth studies and effects of combination treatments ofchemotherapeutic agents with DNMTiAs the first step, we examined the effect of the agents appliedalone on SW48 and HT-29 cell viability. The cells were treatedwith 10 to 100 mM of the evaluated agents. The results of MTTcell viability assay indicated that CRC cells incubated withoxaliplatin and 5-FU showed the most potent inhibition of cellgrowth following 72 h incubation time (Figure 1). The inhibitoryeffects of chemotherapeutics were dose-dependent and thecorrelation coefficients (estimated from the inhibitory dose-response curves) were above 0.9. Demethylating agents, decitabineand zebularine, have demonstrated different modes of inhibition:decitabine was already inhibitory at starting concentration(20 mM) and zebularine showed inhibitory effect from 80 and40 mM for SW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively.We tested also the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents incombination with DNMTi on CRC cells survival (Figure 1).Decitabine potentiated the inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin at theconcentration from 20 mM up to 100 mM, whereas its impact on5-FU activity starts at 80 mM. Zebularine tested at concentrationsup to 100 mM slightly potentiated the inhibitory effects of eitherchemotherapeutics (Figure 1).The type of drug interactions of two evaluated compoundgroups were analyzed with the help of isobolographic and medianeffect methods. The isobolograms show results for single 50%effect level and indicate that interaction of decitabine withchemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic effect, whereasadministration of zebularine with oxaliplatin or 5-FU results insynergistic or slightly additive effects (Figure 2A).Analysis performed by means of median effect methodconfirmed that the combination of decitabine and chemothera-peutic agents in both cell lines produced synergistic effects at 50%cell kill level (Fa = 0.5), achieving CI (Combination Index) values, 0.9 (Figure 2B).Combination of zebularine and chemotherapeutics for Fa =0.5 indicated slight synergistic or additive effects.Analysis of DNA damageTo elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis, we analyzed thephosphorylation status of proteins being of major signalingcheckpoints in response to DNA damage.Upon sensing the DNA damage, series of cellular signalingevents designed to maintain the integrity and proper function ofcells and biological pathways are involved. The proteins chosen fortesting by Western blotting initiate cascades of events that blockcell cycle progression either to allow time to repair damaged DNAor activate cell death pathways if too much damage has beenincurred. Phosphorylated histone H2A.X localizes to the sites ofthe DNA damage and activates the ATM/ATR kinases, thecentral mediators of the DNA damage response. In turn, ATM/ATR kinases initiate cascades, which inhibit progression intomitosis through the activation of the Chk kinases (Chk1 for ATRand Chk2 for ATM) or tumor suppressor protein p53, leading toeither cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis throughregulation of p53 downstream effectors. BRCA1, as the guardianof genomic stability, is also phosphorylated by ATM, ATR, andChk2 in response to DNA damage and can co-localize with otherproteins at DNA damage sites [15].We observed a significant phosphorylation of histone H2A.X atSer139 in response to chemotherapeutic agents and theircombinations with DNMTi, especially in HT-29 cells. Lowerlevels of cH2A.X (phospho-H2A.X) were observed in cells treatedDNMTi Improve the Effect of CytostaticsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305with DNMTi agents only. We also observed elevated levels ofphosphorylation of proteins as ATR at Ser428, ATM at Ser1981,p53 at Ser15, BRCA1 at Ser1524 as well as kinases Chk1 andChk2 at Ser345 and Thr68, respectively (Figure 3A and B).Phosphorylation status of kinases Chk1 and Chk2 was morepronounced in HT-29 then in SW48 cells. In SW48 cells,phosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases was higher afterthe combined treatment with oxaliplain and decitabine ascompared to the treatment with both chemotherapeutics andDNMTi applied singly (Figure 3B).Combinations of chemotherapeutics with DNMTiinfluence the cell cycle progression and induce apoptosisIn the control culture, the percentage of cells in each phase ofthe cell cycle was stable, whereas the tested compounds hadvarious effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Treatmentwith the chemotherapeutics resulted in a consistent increase in thenumber of cells in the S phase at the expense of G1 phase.Decitabine arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M or S phase in theSW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively. Zebularine did not exertstatistically significant changes in both cell lines, as compared tothe controls.The combination of decitabine with oxaliplatin or 5-FUinduced a cell cycle arrest at the S/G2/M phase boundary andat the S phase, respectively, in both cell lines (Figure 4). Thecombination of zebularine with oxaliplatin increased percentage ofthe HT-29 cells at the S/G2/M phase boundary, whereas thecombination of zebularine with 5-FU increased percentage ofthese cells in S phase from 12% to 36% as compared with control.In the case of the SW48 cells, the combinations of zebularine withchemotherapeutics caused the arrest of cells in the G2/M or Sphase (Figure 4A).The analysis of gene expression revealed that the combinationof decitabine with oxaliplatin, as compared to oxaliplatin alone,increased mRNA level of ATM in both cell lines as well as CCNE1in SW48 cell line (Figure 4B). The combinations of demethylatingagents with 5-FU showed a similar tendency, but at a lower levelthan the combinations with oxaliplatin. The analysis of proteinsspecific for cell cycle progression revealed that the combination ofDNMTi with chemotherapeutics, as compared with oxaliplatin/5-FU alone, increased the level of cyclin A1 and protein p53 anddecreased the level of cyclin D1 (but not in the SW48 cells)(Figure 4C and 5B). The combination of zebularine withchemotherapeutics increased the level of p21 in SW48 cells(Figure 4C).Since the prolonged treatment with chemotherapeutics orDNMTi might induce cell death, the early apoptotic marker wasthus analyzed. For this purpose we used annexin V, whichrecognizes phosphatidyl serine (PS). During induction of apoptosis,membrane asymmetry is lost and translocation of PS fromintracellular to external leaflet of the plasma membrane takesplace. As we expected, the treatment of the CRC cells withoxaliplatin or 5-FU alone induced apoptosis in ,30% of the cells,while combinations of the evaluated agents generally increased thenumber of apoptotic cells from ,45% to 60% (Figure 5A) with theexception of the HT-29 cells incubated with demethylating agentsand oxaliplatin together. In this case, the induction of apoptosiswas at a lower level than for other combinations, but stillstatistically significant as compared with oxaliplatin applied alone.In addition, the induction of apoptosis in the CRC cells bycombination of chemotherapeutics with demethylating agents wasconfirmed by changes at the protein level of pro-caspase-3 and -8.The proteolytic cleavage of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymeraseFigure 1.

In this work, we explored the effect ofDNMTi, chemotherapeutics or their combinations on DYm bystaining the cells with JC-1 dye. The analysis of cytograms showedthat the control cells emitted the red fluorescence due to highDYm, whereas the cells treated with chemotherapeutics andDNMTi agents exhibited increased membrane depolarization,detected by green fluorescence, and the effect was sustained(oxaliplatin + DNMTi in HT-29 cell line) or stronger when cellswere co-incubated with these compounds (Figure 5C).DiscussionIn the 90s it has been confirmed that the CRC results not onlyfrom accumulation of genetic mutations but also as a consequenceof epigenetic alterations of the cellular genome that transforms anormal glandular epithelium into adenocarcinoma. It is wellestablished that the most extensively characterized epigeneticalteration in CRCs is gene promoter hypermethylation, whichoccurs in CpG islands that are often present at the 5\u2019 region ofapproximately 60% of the genes. This phenomenon results fromthe increased activity of the DNMT enzyme whose overexpressionis a hallmark of almost all the transformed cells [16]. A growingnumber of genes that are expressed in the colon have now beenshown to be hypermethylated and silenced in colorectal cancer.These include genes involved in cell-cycle control, growth,differentiation, angiogenesis, adhesion, metastasis or DNA repair[17]. Since epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible, theFigure 2. Interactions of standard chemotherapeutics with DNMT inhibitors in the human colorectal cancer cell lines SW48 and HT-29. A.

Therefore developing of some new strategies forthe treatment of such tumors is a challenge to oncology [18]. Thatis why we have presented the results of in vitro study concerninginteractions of standard cytotoxic drugs, 5-FU and oxaliplatin[19], with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such asdecitabine and zebularine.DNMTis have recently gained a lot of attention as agentsinhibiting cancer growth including colorectal carcinoma [20].However, the role of their therapeutic potential may be properlyevaluated only in combination with classic agents used in the CRCtreatment, because all new therapeutic agents are introduced asadd-on options. Since 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin constitute thebackbone treatment of CRC [19], we investigated the effects onCRC cells survival adding decitabine or zebularine - the DNAmethyltransferase inhibitors - to these chemotherapeutics.We have confirmed under in vitro conditions that the studiedagents given alone are able to induce the growth inhibition of thecancer cells with comparable order of potency calculated on thebasis of the percentage of cell survival (Figure 1). Moreover, wehave found an increased inhibition of CRC cells growth aftertreatment with the anticancer agents applied in combination(Figure 1). The isobolograms, constructed on the basis of IC50values, indicated synergistic or additive interactions betweenFigure 3.

Decitabine had the mostfavorable interactions (synergy) in combination with chemother-apeutics in both cell lines; whereas interaction analysis forzebularine showed moderate synergistic or additive effects andthe best results were achieved for combination with oxaliplatin(Figure 2).The interactions observed between both DNMTi agents andchemotherapeutics were dose- and cell line-dependent. Thesynergy between evaluated chemotherapeutics and decitabinewas seen in the SW48 and HT-29 cell lines as well as in the Colo-205 cells, as previously reported [21]. The sensitivity of CRC cellsin combination of zebularine with chemotherapeutics was differentand dependent on cell line. For this combination, synergism andaddition as well as previously presented antagonism were observed[21]. Moreover, reactions of the CRC cells to zebularine and itscombinations were a little weaker. It appears that the two DNAmethyltransferase inhibitors belonging to the same class of agentsinfluence the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutics on CRC cellsgrowth in a qualitatively different manner. These differences maybe related to their structure that exerts a direct effect on thesurvival of CRC cells [4]. The same observation was made inleukemic cells by Flotho et al. [22], who have shown that DNMTis;such as azacitidine, decitabine and zebularine; produce distinctpatterns of gene induction and repression and that this diversity isrelated to the differences in the structure and cellular pharmacol-ogy among DNMT-inhibiting cytosine nucleoside analogues.Decitabine has nitrogen in the place of carbon at position 5 ofthe pyrimidine ring, but zebularine does not. In spite of that, bothagents are incorporated into DNA but before incorporation thesubstances require phosphorylation to render the respectivenucleotide forms. Decitabine is converted by deoxycytidine kinase,whereas zebularine is a substrate for uridine-cytidine kinase[22,23,24]. The inhibitory activity of zebularine is not specific forDNMTs. It is also a strong inhibitor of cytidine deaminase [25,26],therefore most of the drug may be sequestered by the enzyme,lowering thereby the effective concentration of the drug. Anotherexplanation is that the inhibition of cytidine deaminase byzebularine increases cellular concentration of cytidine anddeoxycytidine resulting in competitive inhibition of zebularine[27]. In addition, the kinetics of activation/inactivation andintracellular half-life of metabolites differ among different cytosineanalogues.Generally, decitabine and zebularine possess ability to bindcovalently with DNMT thus obstructing DNA synthesis and, inthis way, leading to the cell death. Additionally, decitabine mayalso induce DNA damage through structural instability at the siteof incorporation [28,29]. Our results reviled that the potentialtherapeutic effect of DNMTi agents, especially decitabine, may beenhanced by 5-FU or oxaliplatin. The former, as an antimetab-olite, can impair replication fork progression by becomingincorporated into the DNA, whereas the latter induces DNAlesions by interstrand cross-links resulting in replication stress.Therefore, we decided to evaluate whether DNA damage processtook place in the cells after treatment with chemotherapeutics,DNMTi and their combinations. It was confirmed by thephosphorylation analysis of histone H2A.X, a member of ahistone H2A family. H2A.X becomes phosphorylated at Ser139by ATM/ATR kinases to form cH2A.X, the earliest indicator ofDNA damages [30,31]. In the current study, we found that thelevel of cH2A.X was strongly increased, especially in HT-29 cells.Our results show that chemotherapeutics as well as theircombinations with DNMTi may activate ATM/ATR kinasespathways (Figure 3) leading, in consequence, to perturbations inthe cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis induction. This findingwas confirmed by further studies discussed below.Combinations of DNMTi with chemotherapeutics led to CRCcell cycle arrest in the S/G2/M transition or S phase, whencompared to the control cycle and the reduction of cell number inthe G1 phase (Figure 4). This was accompanied by increasedmRNA level of ATM, as well as phosphorylation level of ATM atSer1981. Furthermore, we observed the elevated level of ATRphosphorylated at Ser428. Activation of both kinases suggests thatDNA double-stranded breaks (DBS) as well as single-strandedDNA (ssDNA) are formed [32]. The ssDNA is present at processedDSB ends but also at stalled replication forks. Phosphorylation ofATM and ATR kinases induces activation of Chk2 and Chk1kinases, respectively, which in turn induces via phosphorylation thedegradation of Cdc25A and C and phosphorylation of p53 protein[33]. We observed elevated levels of Chk2 and Chk1 phosphor-ylated at Thr68 and Ser345, respectively (Figure 3). This mightindirectly confirm down regulation of Cdc25A and C, the proteintyrosine phosphtases, which are downstream targets of bothkinases. Additionally, we observed a higher level of cyclin Aprobably connected with down regulation of Cdc25A and elevatedphosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser1524, which is essential foractivating the Chk1 kinase and finally G2/M arrest (Figure 3) [34].It is well known, that once the cells accumulate the excess ofDNA damages that overwhelm their capacity of repairing themechanisms for selective elimination of such cells are activated.Indeed, we have observed that simultaneous administration of thetested agents increased the apoptotic response of the cells(Figure 5A). The interaction among the agent combinations ledto augmentation or maintaining of the protein levels of caspase-8and p53 as well as the level of pro-caspase-3 dependently of thecell line studied (Figure 5B). Thus, the cytotoxic effect of DNMTinhibitors and chemotherapeutics may result from apoptosisinduced by internal and slightly external signals. In fact, thepossible involvement of mitochondrial pathway was confirmed bythe finding that the agent combinations (with the exception ofoxaliplatin + zebularine in HT-29 cells) strongly induced thedisruption of DYm (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the activity of thesecombinations was manifested by the cleavage of PARP proteininto 84 kDa and 25 kDa fragments, which facilitates cellulardisassembly and also serves as a marker of cells undergoingapoptosis (Figure 5B).The results obtained in the analyzed cells lines are in some casesdifferent, however the main observations and final conclusions aresimilar. In our opinion, the differences in the response of both celllines may depend on genetic and epigenetic background of thecells. These cell lines carry a BRAF mutation (Colon Cancer Panel2, BRAF; ATCC No. TCP-1007), but the HT-29 cells also carry amutated p53 gene (GRA mutation at codon 273 resulting in anArgRHis substitution, R273H) causing overproduction of apathogenic form of p53, while SW48 cells have a wild-type allele.Since this additional mutation may cause higher sensitivity to suchdrug combinations, it may also be responsible for observed, insome cases, more pronounced response of HT-29 cells.On the other hand, the SW48 cell line is known to harbor moreof the epigenetic changes such as hypermethylation of CpG islandsin the promoter regions leading to inappropriate silencing of somegene, used as an internal control.

Moreover, both cell lines differ in global DNAmethylation levels. Mossman et al. [35] have shown that HT-29cell line displayed a lower level of global DNA methylation thanSW48 cell line and that following the treatment of cells withdecitabine, a substantial decrease of genomic DNA methylationwas observed. The decrease in global methylation in SW48 cellline was greater than 50%, whilst the decrease in HT29 cell linewas not so extensive. The authors also reviled that reduction ofmethylation at specific gene CpG islands was significantly lesseffective [35]. For this reason, we have also analyzed themethylation status of selected genes such as p16INK4a, APC,p14ARF, DAPK and MLH1 using methylation-specific PCR (MSP)(data not shown) and the obtained results were comparable tothose published by Deng et al. and Lind et al. [36,37]. Among bothcell lines tested, the biallelic methylation of promoter region wasobserved in p16INK4aand MLH1 genes, whereas the biallelicmethylation of p14ARFgene was observed only in SW48 cell line.Unfortunately, our studies did not confirm that the application ofDNMTi restores the expression of the evaluated genes and that itis the way by which both agents might enhance the action ofchemotherapeutics. Perhaps such results are linked to the dosagelevels of the compounds tested as well as the incubation time. Mostresults presented by other authors, who observed the reactivationof silenced genes after decitabine or zebularine application, wereconducted for longer time duration, i.e. up to 5\u20138 days, and dosesof the compounds were much lower [8,38]. Nevertheless, ourresults clearly show that DNMTi application can bring benefitsalso in methylation-independent manner and that their actionrelies on cytotoxic properties in the applied range of doses.The mechanism of positive interactions between DNMTinhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents is related to triggeringthe cascade of events leading finally to apoptosis. Such augmen-tation suggests that the cytotoxic effects of classical chemothera-peutics used in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma could beobtained at lower doses and with higher probability for inducingcancer cell death when combined with DNMT inhibitors. It is alsoknown that the abnormal methylation of promoter regions ofregulatory genes is commonly associated with cancer development.Therefore, the methylation inhibitors such as decitabine orzebularine may reactivate the silenced tumor suppressor genes[39] responsible for controlling the cell cycle progression andinduction of apoptosis, and in this way improve the effectiveness ofanticancer therapy with chemotherapeutic agents.In summary, we have demonstrated that DNMT inhibitors, inspite of the less potent action of zebularine, may exert a positiveinteraction with oxaliplatin and 5-FU, the standard chemothera-peutics used in cancer treatment, potentiating the inhibition ofCRC cell survival in vitro. It seems very likely that in the case ofzebularine a more favorable response could be achieved withhigher doses than those presented here, since the toxicity of thisagent was shown to be minimal [27]. Even so, the obtained resultsprovide a rationale to continue research studies that could helpdevelop more effective treatments using methylation inhibitorstogether with standard chemotherapeutics as a new hope in thecolorectal cancer therapy.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Prof. Zenon Jastrze\u0328bski for critical reading ofthe manuscript.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: SF.
