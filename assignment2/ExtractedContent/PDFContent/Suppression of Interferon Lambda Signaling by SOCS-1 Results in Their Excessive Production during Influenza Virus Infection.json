However, excessive productionof cytokines appears to be critical in the pathogenesis of influenza virus. Interferon lambdas (IFN-l) have been shown to beoverproduced during influenza virus infection, but the precise pathogenic processes of IFN-l production have yet to becharacterized. In this report, we observed that influenza virus induced robust expression of IFN-l in alveolar epithelial cells(A549) mainly through a RIG-I-dependent pathway, but IFN-l-induced phosphorylation of the signal transducer andactivator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was dramatically inhibited in the infected cells. Remarkably, influenza virusinfection induced robust expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), leading to inhibition of STAT1activation. Interestingly, the virus-induced SOCS-1 expression was cytokine-independent at early stage of infection both invitro and in vivo. Using transgenic mouse model and distinct approaches altering the expression of SOCS-1 or activation ofSTAT signaling, we demonstrated that disruption of the SOCS-1 expression or expression of constitutively active STAT1significantly reduced the production of IFN-l during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, we revealed that disruption ofIFN-l signaling pathway by increased SOCS-1 protein resulted in the activation of NF-kB and thereby enhanced the IFN-lexpression. Together, these data imply that suppression of IFN-l signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1 causes an adaptiveincrease in IFN-l expression by host to protect cells against the viral infection, as a consequence, leading to excessiveproduction of IFN-l with impaired antiviral response.Citation: Wei H, Wang S, Chen Q, Chen Y, Chi X, et al.

Therefore, IAV has continued to be a top globalpublic health threat. The host cytokine immune response providesthe first line of defense against IAV infection. A variety of cell typesin the host, including activated alveolar macrophages (AM),lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DC), lung alveolar epithelial cells andendothelial cells within lung tissue, produce cytokines andchemokines following IAV infection, thus playing key roles ininnate and adaptive immunity [1\u20133]. However, an aberrant innateresponse, with early recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to thelung, was believed to contribute to the morbidity of the 1918influenza virus infection [4]. Studies have also shown that highlyvirulent influenza virus infection induces excessive cytokineproduction (cytokine storm) and robust recruitment of leukocyteswhich are hypothesized to be major contributors to severe diseasein humans from influenza virus infection [5]. These data revealthat dysregulation of cytokine signaling of the host duringinfluenza virus infection caused by inappropriate activation ofthe innate immune response triggers massive pulmonary injuryand immune-mediated organ dysfunction. However, the mecha-nisms underlying the increased induction of innate immunecytokines during influenza virus infection have to date been largelyunclear.Innate immune responses triggered by the intracellular detec-tion of viral infections include the production of interferons (IFNs)that are classified within the class II cytokine family based on thesimilarity of their receptors. IFNs consist of three types ofcytokines: type I IFNs include IFN-a and IFN-b; type II IFN isIFN-c and type III IFNs consist of three members in humans, IFNlambda1 (IFN-l1), IFN-l2, and IFN-l3 which are also named IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively, whereas mice only expressIFN-l2 and IFN-l3 [6]. Virus-infected cells secrete a complexmixture of IFNs that represent a major element of the innatePLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845immune response against diverse viral infections [7]. In 2003, IFN-ls were first discovered as novel antiviral cytokines by twoindependent groups [8,9]. It is now recognized that IFN-ls arevirus-induced cytokines with type I IFN-like biological functions,including antiviral activity, but have evolved independently of typeI IFNs [10]. Although both type I IFNs and IFN-l are expressedby a host in response to viral infections, IFN-ls, not type I IFNs,are the predominant IFNs induced by respiratory viruses in nasalepithelial cells and mainly contribute to the first line defenseagainst respiratory virus infection [11]. Type I IFNs were firstrecognized for their ability to interfere with IAV replication, butIFN-ls have recently been shown to be present at much higherlevels than type I IFNs in the lungs of infected mice and play animportant role in host defense against IAV infection [2]. However,currently there is limited information available about the biologyof IFN-l. In particular, the mechanisms that regulate the robustexpression of IFN-l during IAV infection are not fully understood.IFN-ls share a common cellular receptor consisting of thecytokine receptor family class II members IL-28R1 and IL-10R2.The short chain IL-10R2 is ubiquitously expressed and is areceptor component of other type II-related cytokines, whereas thelong chain IL-28R1 is unique to IFN-l and is preferentiallyexpressed on epithelial cells [12]. IFN-ls are induced by most, ifnot all, classes of viruses as well as some bacterial products [10].Once secreted, IFN-ls act in an autocrine or paracrine manner bybinding the cell-surface receptors. The receptor binding results ina conformational change in the receptor and activation of thereceptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs). Activated JAK1and Tyk2 transphosphorylate the receptor chains that assist in therecruitment of STAT proteins. STAT proteins are then phos-phorylated, dimerized, and translocated to the nucleus to initiatetranscription of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate thebiological effects of IFN-l. Therefore, IFN-l-mediated activationof JAK/STAT signaling is required for efficiently triggering thesynthesis of antiviral factors.An important mechanism for negative regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is mediated through members of theSOCS family. Of the eight family members, SOCS-1 has beenmost extensively studied and is the most potent inhibitor ofcytokine-induced signaling [13]. SOCS-1 can directly interact withJAKs by its kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits JAKsactivity. In addition, SOCS-1 can target JAKs to proteasomaldegradation through interaction of SOCS box with the ElonginBC complex, which becomes part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase [14\u201316]. When overexpressed in cells, SOCS-1 can inhibit STATactivation induced by multiple cytokine stimulations. Interestingly,several recent studies have revealed that influenza virus hasdeveloped mechanisms to subvert host antiviral defense mediatedby type I and type II IFNs through inhibition of the JAK/STATsignaling by upregulated SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 proteins [17\u201320].Consistent with these observations, it has been shown that IFN-l-induced mRNA expression of the antiviral proteins 29,59-OAS andMx1 was abolished by overexpression of SOCS-1 [21]. However,the relationship between suppression of cytokine signaling bySOCS-1 and overproduction of IFN-l during influenza virusinfection remains to be determined.In this study, we examined the effects of influenza virus-provoked negative regulation of cytokine signaling on the IFN-lproduction by altering expression of SOCS-1 and activation ofSTAT signaling. We found that disrupting SOCS-1 expression orconstitutive activation of STAT1 significantly inhibits productionof IFN-l in vitro and in vivo. The results reveal that suppression ofinnate immune cytokine signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1contributes to formation of IFN-l storm during influenza virusinfection.ResultsIntracellular detection of IAV infection induces robustexpression of IFN-l in alveolar epithelial cells mainlythrough a RIG-I-dependent pathwayTo investigate the mechanisms by which the host cells interactwith influenza A virus (IAV), we have recently used cDNAmicroarray to profile the cellular transcriptional response to A/WSN/33 influenza virus (H1N1) infection in A549 humanalveolar epithelial cells [22]. Surprisingly, we found that IL-28A,IL-28B and IL-29, three recently discovered IFN-l familymembers, were most significantly up-regulated (Figure S1A). Thisfinding was confirmed by independent experiments measuring themRNA levels by quantitative real time PCR of IAV infected A549cells and mouse lungs (Figure 1A and B) and RT-PCR (FigureS1B), and evaluating the IL-29 protein level by ELISA (FigureS1C). Treatment of IAV at 56uC for 30 minutes, which preventsviral replication without affecting viral entry into host cells [23],significantly reduced the virus-induced production of IFN-ls(Figure 1C). To further determine whether production of IFN-lwas affected by viral entry into host cells, IAV was inactivated at65uC for 30 minutes, which denatures hemagglutinin (HA) andprevents host cell attachment [24]. We found that expression ofIFN-l induced by 65uC-inactivated virus recapitulated that of thenon-infected control (Figure 1C). These experiments demonstratedthat robust expression of IFN-ls was the response to live virusentry into host cells and viral replication.To further determine the inducer of IFN-ls, A549 cells weretransfected with either different amounts of total RNA isolatedfrom IAV infected cells (Figure 1D and Figure S1D) or genomicRNA directly isolated from the viruses (Figure S1E). The resultsrevealed that both viral genome RNA and viral RNA generatedduring IAV infection contributed to IFN-l production. Unlikecellular RNA, influenza viral RNA contains a 59-triphosphategroup which is thought to be the critical trigger for production ofAuthor SummaryInfluenza virus infection triggers innate immune responses.However, aberrant host immune responses such asexcessive production of cytokines contribute to thepathogenesis of influenza virus. Type III interferons (IFN-l) constitute the major innate immune response toinfluenza virus infection, but the precise pathogenicprocesses of IFN-l production and mechanistic underpin-nings are not well understood. In this study, we report thatinfluenza virus induces robust IFN-l expression mainlythrough a RIG-I-dependent pathway, but signaling acti-vated by IFN-l was dramatically inhibited by virus-inducedSOCS-1. Importantly, we found that disruption of theSOCS-1 expression or forced activation of STAT1 signifi-cantly reduced the expression of IFN-l in vitro and in vivo,suggesting that suppression of IFN-l signaling by SOCS-1results in their excessive production during influenza virusinfection. Furthermore, our experiments revealed thatdisruption of IFN-l signaling pathway resulted in theactivation of NF-kB that governs the IFN-l expression.Together these findings, we propose that impairedantiviral response of IFN-l due to the inhibitory effect ofSOCS-1 causes an adaptive increase in IFN-l expression byhost to protect cells against the viral infection. This is anovel mechanism that may be critical in the pathogenesisof the influenza virus strains that induce hypercytokinemia.SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda OverproductionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845Figure 1.

Results are representative of three independent experiments.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003845.g001SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda OverproductionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845type I IFNs through RIG-I-dependent pathway [25\u201327]. Using calfintestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) to remove the 59-triphosphateterminus of viral RNA, we tested whether it was involved in IFN-linduction. Interestingly, treatment with CIAP greatly inhibitedexpression of IFN-ls (Figure 1E and Figure S1F). To determinewhether IAV-induced expression of IFN-l was completely depen-dent on RIG-I, A549 cell lines stably expressing shRNAs targetingeither RIG-I, TLR3 or MDA5 were generated (Figure 1F andFigure S1G). We observed that silencing RIG-I resulted in a markeddecrease in the production of IFN-l and silencing TLR3 slightlydecreased the IFN-l levels, whereas disruption of MDA5 expressionhad no overt effects on the IFN-l production (Figure 1G\u2013H andFigure S1G\u2013H). These data suggest that IFN-l induced by the IAVRNA was mainly through a pathway involving RIG-I.IAV inhibits IFN-l-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation inhostIn normal cells, the strength and duration of cytokine signalingare tightly regulated. However, little is known about why a hugeamount of IFN-l is induced during IAV infection. To address thisissue, we sought to investigate whether regulation of IFN-l-mediated signaling was altered during the viral infection. IFN-l,like type I IFN, primarily activates the JAK-STAT signal pathwayto achieve its antiviral function. Unlike type I IFN receptor, IFN-lreceptor is expressed in a cell-specific fashion [28]. Here weobserved that IFN-l was able to activate JAK-STAT signalpathway in A549 cells (Figure 2A, B). Furthermore, the level ofIFN-l-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was markedly reduced inIAV infected cells, as compared with that in control cells(Figure 2B\u2013D). To substantiate this finding, a time courseexperiment was performed. We found that phosphorylation ofSTAT1 in infected cells was dramatically inhibited at later stagesof infection (after 15 h p.i.) (Figure 2E), while no significantdecrease in STAT1 phosphorylation was observed in the cellstreated with corresponding culture supernatants (SN) from theinfected cells (Figure 2F). These data indicate that activation ofJAK-STAT signaling by IFN-l was suppressed in the presence ofIAV.Figure 2. IAV inhibits IL-29-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in A549 cells.

Of the eightmembers of SOCS family, SOCS-1 is the most potent inhibitor ofcytokine-induced signaling. In addition, it has recently emergedthat SOCS-1 is an important regulator of innate immune responsetriggered by IAV [18]. Therefore, we hypothesized that SOCS-1 isinvolved in inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation during IAVinfection. To test this, SOCS-1 mRNA levels in A549 cells duringIAV infection were examined by quantitative RT-PCR(Figure 3A). The mRNA level of SOCS-1 was significantly up-regulated at early stages and began to reduce at late stages ofinfection, but its protein level was consistently increased(Figure 3B). Immunofluorescence study showed that increasedexpression of SOCS-1 and inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylationoccurred specifically in IAV infected cells (Figure S2A, S2B). Thisimplies that there might be a certain relationship betweenexpression of SOCS-1 protein and inhibition of STAT1phosphorylation. Surprisingly, although SOCS-1 expression inA549 cells was induced by supernatants derived from infected cellculture at later stages (Figure 3C, D and Figure S2C), the SOCS-1Figure 3. IAV infection induces robust expression of SOCS-1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of STAT1. (A) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of SOCS-1 in A549 infected with WSN for indicated time. (B) Lysates from cells in (A) wereanalyzed for the protein levels of SOCS-1, as detected by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. (C) A549 cells were infected by WSN forindicated time. Supernatants (SN) derived from these cells were used to stimulate the native A549 for 2 h. Both infected cells and supernatants-stimulated cells were lysed and analyzed for SOCS-1 expression by RT-PCR. (D) SOCS-1 levels in (C) were quantitated by densitometry, and normalizedto GAPDH levels as described in Figure 2D. Plotted are the average levels from three independent experiments. The error bars represent the S.E. (E)A549 cells expressing shRNAs targeting either SOCS-1 or control luciferase (Luc) were infected with WSN for 15 h. Western blotting was performed todetermine the interference efficiency. Treatment with SOCS-1-shRNA#2 caused approximately 75% reduction in SOCS-1 expression quantitated bydensitometry. Thus, SOCS-1-shRNA#2 was used in this study. (F) SOCS-1-ablated or control A549 cells were infected with WSN for the indicated time.Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot probed with the antibodies as indicated.

The results strongly suggest that during IAV infection,there was a cytokine-independent mechanism to induceSOCS-1 expression.To further verify the functional involvement of SOCS-1 in thesuppression of STAT1 activation, SOCS-1 expression in A549cells was knocked down by shRNA (Figure 3E). In SOCS-1knockdown A549 cells, but not the control cells, the level ofSTAT1 phosphorylation was notably increased during theinfection (Figure 3F, G), indicating that SOCS-1 was a directinhibitor of STAT1 phosphorylation during IAV infection.SOCS-1-mediated inhibition of cytokine signalingcontributes to excessive production of IFN-l during IAVinfectionSince JAK-STAT signaling was inhibited by IAV-induced SOCS-1, we asked whether the activated JAK-STAT pathway by IFN-l isalso disrupted by SOCS-1. To address this issue, we examined theeffect of SOCS-1 protein on activation of STAT1 by IL-29. Asshown in Figure 4A, down-regulation of SOCS-1 enhanced IL-29-induced activation of STAT1, whereas overexpression of SOCS-1inhibited IL-29-induced activation of STAT1 in A549 cells,revealing that SOCS-1 negatively regulates IL-29-mediated STAT1signaling. Moreover, in IAV-infected SOCS-1-ablated A549 cells,Figure 4. Inhibition of cytokine-mediated STAT1 activation by SOCS-1 contributes to overproduction of IFN-l during IAV infection.(A) A549 cells expressing SOCS-1, empty vector (EV) or shRNAs targeting SOCS-1 or luciferase (Luc) were treated with or without IL-29 (50 ng/ml) for45 min.

(F) Levels of these mRNAs in (E) were quantitated by densitometry, and normalized to GAPDH levels as described in Figure 2D. mRNAlevel in infected control cells is 100. Plotted are the average results from three independent experiments. The error bars represent the S.E. Statisticalsignificance of change was determined by Student\u2019s t-test (*P,0.05).doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003845.g004SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda OverproductionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845STAT1 phosphorylation was markedly elevated by IL-29 stimula-tion, and this effect was prolonged in both infected and uninfectedcells when compared to the control cells (Figure 4B, C). Thesefindings suggest that SOCS-1 inhibits IL-29 signal pathway duringIAV infection.Since IAV-induced expression of SOCS-1 appeared earlier thanexpression of IFN-l (see above description), it was interesting toinvestigate whether the induced SOCS-1 influenced IFN-lproduction. Surprisingly, the protein level of IL-29 was signif-icantly reduced in the SOCS-1-ablated cells, comparing with thatin the control cells infected with IAV (Figure 4D). Furthermore,the mRNA levels of IL-29 and IL-28A/B were also significantlyreduced in SOCS-1-ablated A549 cells (Figure 4E, F), while themRNA levels of ISGs (MX1 and OAS-2) did not changesignificantly at this time point (Figure 4E, F). The results suggestthat the antiviral response is not affected despite less production ofIFN-l in SOCS-1-ablated cells.Forced activation of STAT1 causes a significant decreasein type III IFN expression during IAV infectionBecause the results presented above revealed that IFN-l-mediated activation of STAT1 was abrogated during IAVinfection, next we asked whether forced activation of STAT1had any effect on expression of IFN-ls. To test this possibility, wegenerated A549 cell lines stably expressing either empty vector(EV), STAT1 wild type (WT), or constitutively activated formSTAT1-2C (2C) [29,30]. The enhancement of STAT1 phosphor-ylation during IAV infection or stimulated by IFN-l wasconfirmed in STAT1-2C-expressing cells (Figure 5A, B). STAT1phosphorylation was also increased in infected cells overexpressingSTAT1-WT as compared to the control cells (Figure 5B).Interestingly, production of IL-29 protein was remarkablydecreased in the STAT1-2C-expressing cells as compared to thecontrol after IAV infection (Figure 5C). Consistent with thisobservation, the mRNA levels of IL-29 and IL-28A/B weresignificantly reduced in IAV infected STAT1-2C-expressing cells(Figure 5D, E). Furthermore, we tested whether alteration of IFNsignaling had any effect on IFN-a and IFN-b production. Wefound that silencing SOCS-1 or overexpression of STAT1 slightlyreduced the type I IFN production during IAV infection (FigureS3A\u2013C). On the other hand, no significant change in the inductionof OAS-2 and Mx1 was observed in these cells at late time pointspost infection (Figure 5D, E). Interestingly, at early time point postinfection, activation of STAT1 signaling promoted expression ofOAS-2 and Mx1 (Figure S3D\u2013F).Disruption of IFN-l signaling pathway results in robustactivation of NF-kB during IAV infectionIn an attempt to provide insights into the mechanism of howinhibition of cytokine signaling causes excessive expression of IFN-l during IAV infection, we evaluated the pathway governing IFN-l expression. We found that level of viral RNA, the inducer ofIFN-l expression was unchanged by silencing SOCS-1 expressionor forcing STAT1 activation (Figure S3G, S3H). Furthermore,forced activation of cytokine signaling did not alter expression ofPattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs) including RIG-I andTLR3 (Figure S3H). Expression of TLR-7/8 was also examinedbut they were undetectable in A549 cells.Since alteration of cytokine signaling did not affect the levels ofPRRs and viral RNA and given that IRF3 is a known regulator ofIFN expression at the early stage of infection, we determinedwhether there was a functional link between IFN-l signaling andactivation of nuclear factor of kB (NF-kB), a key transcriptionalfactor downstream of RIG-I pathway [31]. To this end, cells wereinfected with IAV using increasing MOI. Interestingly, experimentusing luciferase reporter gene revealed a positive correlationbetween increased NF-kB activity and increased expression ofSOCS-1 and IFN-l in infected cells (Figure 6A, B). By contrast,STAT1 phosphorylation and IkB protein levels were consistentlyreduced (Figure 6C). To further confirm this finding, we employedthe A549 cell lines stably expressing SOCS-1 shRNA or activeform of STAT1. We observed that in infected cells, depletion ofSOCS-1 increased IkB protein level (Figure 6D) and significantlydecreased NF-kB activation (Figure 6E). Similarly, forced activa-tion of STAT1 inhibited the degradation of IkB (Figure 6F), andas a result, activation of NF-kB was significantly suppressed in theinfected cells (Figure 6G). In contrast, low IkB level and high levelof NF-kB activation were detected in SOCS-1-overexpressing cellsafter IAV infection even using low MOI (Figure S4A, S4B).Consistent with these observations, immunofluorescence micros-copy study showed that nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 wassignificantly abrogated in SOCS-1-ablated or STAT1-activatedcells infected with IAV (Figure 6H, I and Figure S4C, S4D).Together, these results suggest that disruption of cytokine signalingpathway results in robust activation of NF-kB, which causesexcessive production of IFN-l during IAV infection.Suppression of cytokine signaling by IAV-induced SOCS-1contributes to overproduction of IFN-l in vivoTo confirm the correlation of type III IFN expression with theactivation of STAT-1 and NF-kB signaling, a time course studywas performed in more detail in infected cell culture (Figure 7A).The results indicated that disruption of IFN-l signal by SOCS-1increased their expression likely through activating NF-kB in IAVinfected cells. Next, we sought to determine the expression levels ofSOCS-1 in mouse lung at different stages of IAV infection. Wefound that MLD50 of the WSN virus was approximately36103 pfu under our conditions, consistent with the previousobservation [32]. Therefore, mice were inoculated intranasallywith 16105 pfu of the virus (about 33 MLD50) as previouslydescribed [33,34]. As shown in Figure 7B, expression of SOCS-1protein was consistently increased during 3 days of infection. As aconsequence, STAT1 phosphorylation was inhibited (Figure 7B).Moreover, activity of NF-kB was elevated during the infection asindicated by the gradually diminished IkBa levels, suggesting thatthe expression kinetics of IFN-l correlated with NF-kB activation.Of interest, expression of SOCS-1 was earlier and faster than thatof IFN-l (Figure S5A, B), suggesting that SOCS-1 expression iscytokine-independent at least at the early stage of infection andSOCS-1 might regulate IFN-l expression beyond negativefeedback regulation to respond the cytokines in vivo. This findingis consistent with our in vitro results presented above (Figure 3C,D).To further address the relationship between the expression ofSOCS-1 and the induction of IFN-l, membrane-permeablepeptides of SOCS-1-KIR and pJAK2 were used to mimicSOCS-1 overexpression and counteract SOCS-1 function,respectively. The functions of these peptides in IFN-l responsewere confirmed in vitro, as the phosphorylation of STAT1stimulated by IL-29 was dramatically inhibited in the presenceof SOCS-1-KIR but not the control peptide SOCS-1-KIR2A(Figure 7C), and the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1-KIR on STAT1phosphorylation was markedly diminished when SOCS-1-KIRwas added together with pJAK2 peptide (Figure 7F). When micewere treated with these peptides and then inoculated with IAV,IFN-l level was significantly increased in mice treated by SOCS-1-KIR (Figure 7D and Figure S5C). By contrast, the expression ofSOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda OverproductionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845IFN-l in mice treated with pJAK2 peptide was significantlyreduced as compared to control group (Figure 7G and FigureS5D). Furthermore, low levels of STAT1 phosphorylation andIkBa protein were found in SOCS-1-KIR treated mice after IAVinfection (Figure 7E), whereas high levels of STAT1 phosphory-lation and IkBa protein were present in pJAK2 treated group(Figure 7H). In addition, our experiments showed that treatmentwith SOCS-1-KIR increased mouse body weight loss, whereaspJAK2 treatment reduced the body weight loss during IAVinfection (Figure S5E\u2013F). Together, these data suggest thatJAK-STAT signaling pathway is disrupted by increased SOCS-1in infected mice, which results in an increase in IFN-l expressionlikely through activating NF-kB.Silencing SOCS-1 significantly reduces IFN-l expressionin transgenic mice during IAV infectionTo further define the role of SOCS-1 in IFN-l productioninduced by IAV, we wished to establish a more physiologicalmodel system for analysis of SOCS-1 involvement in this process.Figure 5.

Thetransgenic founders with high interference efficiency were selected(Figure 8C, D). We found that the level of STAT1 phosphory-lation was greatly increased in TG compared to wild type (WT)mice after IAV infection (Figure 8E). In contrast, the activity ofNF-kB was reduced as indicated by increased IkBa level.Consistent with this, expression of IFN-l was significantlydecreased in IAV infected TG mice (Figure 8F, G). Furthermore,by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, we found that on Day 3p.i., the lung in mice showed obvious inflammation, but theinflammation in the lung of SOCS-1 knockdown TG mice wasminor compared to WT control (Figure S6A). Less body weightloss was observed and Less viral load was detected in the lung ofTG mice than that in WT group (Figure 8H and Figure S6B\u2013C),suggesting that although IFN-l expression is reduced in SOCS-1knockdown TG mice, the innate antiviral immune response isenhanced.DiscussionThe clearance of IAV during infection depends on theactivation of effective innate and adaptive immune responses.Cytokines activate innate immune responses and initiate thedevelopment of adaptive, virus-specific immune responses [37,38].Thus, cytokines play critical roles in defense against the virusinfection. Various types of cells in host secrete cytokines andchemokines following IAV infection. Among these cell types,epithelial cells are thought to be one of the most importantcytokine-producing cells during IAV infection, and believed to bevital for the virus-induced cytokine storm [39]. We have previouslyprofiled the cellular transcriptional response to IAV infection inhuman type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549 and found that thistype of cell expresses many different cytokines and chemokinesafter the virus infection [22]. In this study, we show that IAVinfection induces excessive expression of IFN-l that is mainlydependent on RIG-I signaling and partially on TLR3 signaling,indicating that they are involved in the innate antiviral response tothe infection. This observation is consistent with previous studiesshowing that IFN-l are the predominant IFNs induced byrespiratory viruses and have a wide range of antiviral functionsin response to respiratory viruses [11], hepatitis C virus [40],rotavirus [12], herpes simplex virus [41] and influenza virus [42].IFN-l receptor complex is composed of the ubiquitouslyexpressed short chain IL-10R2 and the long chain IL-28R1expressed preferentially on epithelial cells [12]. IFN-ls bind thereceptors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway whichinitiates transcription of the ISGs. Thus, IFN-ls, like other types ofIFNs, play important roles in the control of IAV propagation inepithelial cells [42,43]. Since IFNs are important in a variety ofcellular processes, their production and response are delicatelyregulated by multiple mechanisms. Viruses have evolved differentways to counteract these mechanisms, leading to dysregulation ofIFN expression and function, and then successfully evaded the hostantiviral response. IAV also exerts its effects through somemechanisms. For example, the viral non-structural protein 1(NS1) has been shown to inhibit type I IFN response and blockIFN-b production. On the other hand, it has also been shown thatthe capacity of NS1 to confer resistance to host immune responseby decreasing sensitivity to particular cytokines causes theiroverproduction [39]. It remains an ongoing task to determinewhether overproduction of IFN-ls is regulated by the NS1.Recently, it has been shown that IAV induces expression ofSOCS-1 and SOCS-3 to negatively regulate JAK-STAT pathwayand thereby down-regulates the innate immune responseincluding abrogation of the type I IFN signaling [17]. In thepresent study, we found that SOCS-1 was greatly induced beforethe abundant secretion of cytokines in both IAV-infected A549cells and IAV-infected mice, strongly indicating that during IAVinfection, there is a cytokine-independent mechanism to provokeSOCS-1 expression at least at the early stage. Similarly, it hasbeen reported that early induction of SOCS-3 transcription isIFN-b-independent [17]. However, Julien and coworkers haveobserved that up-regulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in IAV-infected cells is IFNAR1-dependent [18], which does notcontradict with our observation, because we found that theculture supernatants at the later stages of infection indeedstimulated SOCS-1 expression. Therefore, we conclude that IAVmight induce cytokines-independent SOCS-1 expression throughother mechanisms, and at least this is true at the early stage ofIAV infection.Our experiments demonstrated that IAV-provoked STAT1phosphorylation at the early stage of infection was inhibited by thevirus-induced SOCS-1. Furthermore, we provided evidence thatJAK-STAT signaling activated by IFN-l was also inhibited bySOCS-1. It has been previously shown that IAV abrogates theinnate immune response mediated by type I IFNs and IFN-c bydisruption of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [17,20]. However,little is known about how suppression of cytokine signaling bySOCS proteins affects the production of IFNs during IAVinfection. Interestingly, here we found that the IFN-l levels weresignificantly decreased in IAV infected SOCS-1-depleted A549cells and transgenic mice as compared to infected controls.Importantly, forced activation of STAT1 also significantly inhibitsthe production of IFN-l in vitro and in vivo. Despite decreasedexpression of IFN-l, the antiviral response was not impaired inSOCS-1-depleted cell and animal. These results suggest thatsuppression of IFN-l signaling by SOCS-1 results in theirexcessive production during IAV infection. Our hypothesis is thatsuppression of cytokine signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1 leadsto an adaptive increase in IFN-l production by host to protectcells against viral infection. However, increased IFN-l furtherinduces the expression of SOCS-1 at late stage of infection, whichin turn, inhibits the activation of JAK-STAT signaling. Finally,this vicious cycle results in the excessive production of IFN-l withan impaired antiviral activity due to increased SOCS-1 proteinduring IAV infection. Although we observed that forced activationof IFN signal also slightly decreased the levels of type I IFNs,whether this hypothesis applies to other cytokine storm provokedby highly virulent influenza virus infection is unclear. In addition,we found that after IAV infection, the SOCS-1 knockdowntransgenic mice did not display a remarkable phenotype ascompared to wild type mice. However, it is possible that SOCS-1-mediated upregulation of IFN-l levels has a more prominent rolein pathogenesis of highly pathogenic strains of IAV that elicitindicated antibodies.

These remain to befurther determined.Our study has also begun to address the mechanism by whichinhibition of cytokine signaling causes the excessive expression ofIFN-l during IAV infection. We presume that the repression ofSTAT1 might activate other transcriptional factors to elevatecytokine levels. Previous studies have shown that aryl hydrocarbonreceptor couples with STAT1 to regulate lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses [44]. It has also been revealedthat progressive dysregulation of NF-kB and STAT1 leads to pro-angiogenic production of CXC chemokines [45]. It is thought thatNF-kB and STAT1 might have a crosstalk [46\u201348]. Although it isunclear how the phosphorylation of STAT1 can be associated withNF-kB activation [49], our data showed that IAV inhibitedFigure 7.

Together, these data suggest that suppression of cytokinesignaling by SOCS-1 may influence the NF-kB activation.

All mouse experimentalprocedures were performed in accordance with the Regulationsfor the Administration of Affairs Concerning ExperimentalAnimals approved by the State Council of People\u2019s Republic ofChina.Influenza virus and infectionInfluenza virus strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was prepared aspreviously described [22,51]. For infection, cells were washed withphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with the multiplicityof infection (MOI) as indicated in the figure legends. Afteradsorption with a-MEM medium containing 2 mg/ml TPCK (L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone)-treated trypsin,100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin for 45 minutesat 37uC, the supernatant was aspirated and cells were culturedwith the a-MEM medium for indicated time. To inactivate theviruses, equal amounts of viruses were incubated at 56uC or 65uCfor 30 minutes as described previously [24].Plasmids and luciferase assayPlasmids pRC-CMV-STAT1-WT and pRC-CMV-STAT1-2Cin which N658 and A656 of STAT1 were substituted by cysteineresidues were kindly provided by Dr. David A. Frank (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The cDNA coding STAT1-WT or STAT1-2C was subcloned into the Not I/Sal I sites ofretroviral vector pMSCV-IRES-GFP (pMIG) to generate pMIG-STAT1-WT and pMIG-STAT1-2C. The vector pMIG-SOCS-1was previously described [13]. NF-kB-luciferase reporter namedpNF-kB-Luc and Renilla luciferase reporter named pRL-TK weregifts from Dr. Shijuan Gao (Institute of Microbiology, ChineseAcademy of Sciences).

Peptides of SOCS-1-KIR ((53)DTHFRTFRSHSDYRRI),SOCS-1-KIR2A ((53)DTHFATFASHSDYRRI) and pJAK2((1001)LPQDKEYYKVKEP) were synthesized by ChinaPeptides(Shanghai, China). All peptides were synthesized with an attachedlipophilic group, palmitic acid, to facilitate entry into cells aspreviously described [16,52]. Peptides were purified by preparativeRP-HPLC, and were characterized by LC-MS and HPLC analysis.Cytokines, cell stimulation, and ELISARecombinant human IL-28A and IL-29 were purchased fromPeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were incubated with therecombinant IL-29 (50 ng/ml) for 45 minutes for stimulation,unless otherwise indicated. Supernatant culture medium from theA549 cells infected with IAV strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was alsoused as a source of virus-induced cytokines for cell stimulation. Toquantify IL-29 production by host cells, supernatant culturemedium from virus infected cells was harvested and examined byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the ready-SET-Go of human IL-29 analysis kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA)according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Stimulation of cells with RNATotal RNA was prepared from A549 cells infected with the IAVfor 8 hours (viral RNA) or from uninfected cells (cellular RNA)using Trizol (TIANGEN BIOTECH BEIJING CO., LTD.)according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The calf intestinealkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (TaKaRa) was used to dephosphor-ylate viral 59-triphosphate RNA as previously described [17].A549 cells were transfected with the isolated RNA usingLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Supernatant medium fromtransfected cells was harvested and examined by ELISA for IL-29 production. The transfected cells were lysed and examined byreal-time PCR for expression of indicated genes.Western blotting and immunofluorescenceFor Western blotting analysis, cell lysates were separated bySDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto anitrocellulose membrane, and probed with indicated antibodiesas described previously [53]. To detect nuclear translocation ofNF-kB p65, immunofluorescence was performed as describedpreviously [22].

A549 cell linesstably expressing STAT1-WT, STAT1-2C, SOCS-1 or emptyvector (EV) were generated by infecting the cells with retrovirusesencoding these genes in pMIG vector as previously described [13].Mouse experimentsFemale BALB/c mice (5\u20136 weeks old, 18\u201320 g) were providedby Vital River Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, China). Todetermine the 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of the virus, sixgroups of five mice were inoculated intranasally with 10-fold serialdilutions of virus. MLD50 titres were calculated by the method ofReed and Muench [59]. For infection, mice were inoculatedintranasally with 16105 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the A/WSN/33 virus.
