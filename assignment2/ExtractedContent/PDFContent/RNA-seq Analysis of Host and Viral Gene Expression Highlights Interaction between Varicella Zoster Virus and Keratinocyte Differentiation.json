Using a calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation model we investigated the interaction between epidermaldifferentiation and VZV infection. RNA-seq analysis showed that VZV infection has a profound effect on differentiatingkeratinocytes, altering the normal process of epidermal gene expression to generate a signature that resembles patterns ofgene expression seen in both heritable and acquired skin-blistering disorders. Further investigation by real-time PCR,protein analysis and electron microscopy revealed that VZV specifically reduced expression of specific suprabasalcytokeratins and desmosomal proteins, leading to disruption of epidermal structure and function. These changes wereaccompanied by an upregulation of kallikreins and serine proteases. Taken together VZV infection promotes blistering anddesquamation of the epidermis, both of which are necessary to the viral spread and pathogenesis. At the same time,analysis of the viral transcriptome provided evidence that VZV gene expression was significantly increased followingcalcium treatment of keratinocytes. Using reporter viruses and immunohistochemistry we confirmed that VZV gene andprotein expression in skin is linked with cellular differentiation. These studies highlight the intimate host-pathogeninteraction following VZV infection of skin and provide insight into the mechanisms by which VZV remodels the epidermalenvironment to promote its own replication and spread.Citation: Jones M, Dry IR, Frampton D, Singh M, Kanda RK, et al.

In both diseases, VZV replication in theepidermal layer of skin results in the formation of largepolykaryocytes and the development of blisters containinginfectious cell-free virus. The epidermis is a continually regener-ating tissue layer that develops a stratified structure, which ismaintained by keratinocytes, specialized cells which produce anetwork of keratin filaments anchored to intracellular junctions toprovide structural support to the tissue. As keratinocytes transitfrom the stem-cell rich basal to the uppermost layer of theepidermis, they undergo a program of terminal differentiation.Each stratum (basal, spinous, granular, lucidum and cornified) [1]identified within the stratified epidermis is associated withestablished signature patterns of gene expression [2] [3]. Thisprocess is tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms thatinvolve calcium gradients, microRNAs, developmental signallingpathways and proteolytic cascades [4,5,6,7,8,9].Although VZV infects primary cultured keratinocytes [10] littleis known about the interaction between VZV replication andepidermal differentiation. Previous work has shown that VZVreplication in skin differs from monolayer cultures in that certainVZV proteins, such as ORF10 and ORF11, are not required forreplication in melanoma monolayer cultures but are necessary foroptimal replication in foetal skin xenografts of SCID-hu mice,[11,12]. Additionally, the live attenuated VZV vaccine, vOKA,replicates well in tissue culture but is attenuated for replication inskin but not in lymphoid or neuronal xenografts in SCID-humouse models [13].In the present study we used an in vitro calcium induced modelof epithelial differentiation [5] and analysed the transcriptome ofuninfected and VZV-infected primary keratinocytes using RNA-PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896seq. This approach identified not only the effect of VZV onkeratinocytes but also the consequence of keratinocyte differenti-ation on VZV replication and maturation. Together our dataprovides intriguing new insights into host\u2013pathogen interactions.ResultsVZV infection of primary keratinocytesAs keratinocytes differentiate they lose basally expressedcytokeratins (KRT5/14/15) and increase the expression ofdifferentiation markers e.g. suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10)and involucrin (IVL). The addition of calcium to primarykeratinocytes in culture, mimics the calcium gradient across theepidermis and the process of epidermal differentiation [5]. Toassess the effect of calcium on primary keratinocytes we measuredby qPCR the change in the expression of selected keratinocytemarkers known to be altered by differentiation (KRT10, KRT15and IVL) (Figure S1) and confirmed our findings by immunoblot-ting for KRT10 and IVL (Figure S1). In our hands, the addition ofcalcium to 1.2 mM increased the expression of the suprabasal(KRT10) and granular marker (IVL) as well as reducing theexpression of the basal marker (KRT15), demonstrating that wecould use calcium to induce keratinocyte differentiation.The ability of VZV to infect primary human keratinocytes haspreviously been assessed [10]. Sexton and colleagues noted thatmaintaining the keratinocytes in a low calcium media prior toVZV infection resulted in a higher initial infection. We were ableto infect cells grown in low calcium [0.6 mM] (2calcium) and highcalcium [1.2 mM] (+calcium) media with VZV as detected by aninfectious centre assay (Figure 1A\u2013B). Over the course of a 5 dayinfection we observed an increase in the number of VZV foci,indicating cell to cell spread, full replication and production ofinfectious virus (Figure 1C). As previously observed [10] whenVZV was added to cells cultured in high calcium medium, thenumber of foci was less and plateaued after one day, suggestingreduced replication and spread. To optimise a model with whichto investigate the interaction of VZV and keratinocyte differen-tiation, we next examined the effect of adding calcium [1.2 mM]to cells already infected with VZV. By immunohistochemistry, theVZV plaque size was comparable to the 2calcium cells(Figure 1A\u2013B), but the number of foci counted was still less whencalcium was added 3 days p.i. (Figure 1C). Primary keratinocytesin culture are known to change size [14], develop tight junctionsand form clusters [15] when treated with calcium. To ensure thatthis did not affect the number of VZV plaques counted, theinfected keratinocytes and the associated supernatants weretransferred onto MeWo cells and the VZV titres calculated.VZV was not detected in the supernatants of any sample (data notshown). The VZV titre in the +calcium cells at days 4\u20135 p.i. wassignificantly less than in the 2calcium cells. However, by addingthe calcium to the cells 3 days after VZV infection, the VZV titreswere higher than in the +calcium cells and by day 5 no significantdifference was seen in the VZV titres between the 2calcium cellsand the cells which the calcium had been added 3 days p.i.(Figure 1D). Flow cytometry analysis of VZV keratinocytesconfirmed that keratinocytes cultured in high calcium media(+calcium) express fewer VZV proteins than the cells culture inlow calcium media (2calcium) but this could be increased byadding calcium at 3 days p.i. (Figure S2). Moreover, this findingwas independent of whether cell-associated or cell-free VZV wasused to infect cells. VZV gene expression (ORF29) was comparedby real time PCR in cells grown in low calcium media (2calcium)and cells switched to a high calcium media at day 3 post VZVinfection (Fig. 1E). The expression of ORF29 peaked at 48 hrs inboth the comparisons with increased expression seen in thesamples which had calcium added at day 3.From the combined data above showing peak of VZVgene expression at 48 hrs following the calcium switch and thedata showing increased expression of host differentiation markersat 24\u201348 hours following the addition of calcium (Figure S1),we determined that the optimal time point at which to examineboth host and viral gene expression together was 48 hrs aftercalcium-induced differentiation of keratinocytes infected withVZV 3 days previously. Using this model, we comparedundifferentiated (2calcium) and differentiated (calcium added atday 3 post infection) keratinocytes as well as studying the effect ofthe keratinocyte differentiation on the viral transcriptome(Figure 1F).To summarise, primary human keratinocytes were plated out atday 0 and infected/mock infected with VZV at an m.o.i of 0.2 atday 2. Cells were then incubated at 34uC until day 5 before eithermaintaining the cultures in a low calcium media or switching to ahigh calcium media at day 3 p.i. Total RNA was harvested at day7 (48 hrs after changing media and 5 days p.i.) for all fourexperimental conditions (K; Keratinocytes, KV; Keratinocytesand VZV, KC; Keratinocytes and Calcium and KCV; Keratino-cytes, Calcium and VZV) as illustrated in Figure 1H.The cDNA was sequenced using the Illumina RNA-seqplatform. Between 15\u2013366106 reads were generated per lane ofwhich 4.8\u2013126106 mapped to the human transcriptome onceduplicate reads had been removed (Homo sapiens (release 37)reference sequence GRCh37/hg19: Table S1). Similar distribu-tions of reads per gene were found across all samples beforenormalisation with no major outliers (Figure S3). The number ofduplicate reads per sample varied between 21\u201345%, with higherlevels of duplication observed in the samples from batch 3,presumably due to a PCR batch effect. However, estimated librarysizes (10\u2013326106) were independent of batch and average qualityscores rose from 31 for batches 1 and 2 to 38 for batch 3,corresponding to updated Illumina reagents and protocol.Post-normalisation, clustering transcriptome profiles by Spearman\u2019srank correlation coefficient gave tight clusters for the calcium treatedAuthor SummaryVaricella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles,which are characterised by the formation of fluid-filled skinlesions. Infectious viral particles present in these lesions arecritical for airborne spread to cause chickenpox in non-immune contacts and for infection of nerve ganglia vianerve endings in the skin, a pre-requisite for shingles.Several VZV proteins, although dispensable in laboratorycell-culture, are essential for VZV infection of skin, a findingthought to relate to VZV interaction with a process knownas epidermal differentiation. In this, the specialisedkeratinocyte cells of the outer layer of skin, the epidermis,are continually shed to be replaced by differentiatingkeratinocytes, which migrate up from lower layers. HowVZV interaction with epidermal differentiation leads to theformation of fluid-filled lesions remains unclear. We showusing a keratinocyte model of epidermal differentiationthat VZV infection alters epidermal differentiation, gener-ating a specific pattern of changes in that is characteristicof blistering and skin shedding diseases. We also identifiedthat the differentiation status of the keratinocytes influ-ences the replication pattern of the viral gene and proteinexpression, with both increasing as the VZV particlestraverses to the uppermost layers of the skin. The findingsprovide new insights into VZV-host cell interactions.VZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896samples (KC and KCV), whilst those for the KV and K samples weremore dispersed with clustering being more heavily dependent onkeratinocyte batch. The exceptions were samples KV2 and KV5,which clustered tightly with the KC samples (Figure S3).To ensure that no bias was introduced into the cDNAlibrary, ten genes were amplified by real time PCR, andshown to have good overall correlation to RNA-seq reportswhen comparing the effect of virus in calcium-treated (KCV/Figure 1.

Cells were cultured for up to 5days p.i. and fixed in 4% PFA. VZV infected cells were identified using IHC and images of the VZV colonies were captured and counted.

From this, likelihood-ratio tests were performed, identi-fying 3863 differentially expressed genes across 6 comparisons ofinterest (KC/K, KV/K, KCV/KC, KCV/KV, KCV/K andKV/KC), (Figure 2A\u2013B).The greatest degree of differential expression was seen by theaddition of calcium to uninfected keratinocytes (KC/K). A total of1786 genes were altered (463 genes up-regulated, 1323 genesdown-regulated), the pattern of which was consistent with theinduction of keratinocyte differentiation with a decrease in theexpression of basally expressed cytokeratins and an increase in theexpression of most but not all of genes expressed in both thesuprabasal and granular layers (Figure S4) and in keeping with theknown limitations of the keratinocyte calcium-switch model, wedid not see changes in genes that are expressed in the cornifiedlayer. In contrast, relatively few genes were significantly altered byviral infection alone (KV/K, 110 upregulated, 53 downregulated).Although approximately the same viral titres were achieved inboth conditions, (Figure 1D) significantly more genes weredifferentially expressed in the KCV/KC comparison (1049Figure 2. Overview of transcription data. A) Summary of the number of significantly up and down regulated genes (FDR,0.01) observed acrossall six possible comparisons of the four sample types e.g. 463 genes are up regulated in KC/K whilst 53 genes are down regulated in KV/K.

Pairs of arrows in the intersection refer to the direction of fold change in the comparisons on the left and right hand sidesrespectively. Comparisons are shown for: C) KCV/KV and KCV/KV, D) KC/K and KCV/KC, E) KV/K and KCV/KC and F) KC/K and KCV/KV genes. For thesefour Venn diagrams (e.g comparison X vs. comparison Y), those genes that are up or down-regulated in X but not significantly altered in Y are shownon the left-hand side with single arrows denoting the direction of fold change. The converse is shown on the right-hand side (i.e. genes that aredifferentially expressed in Y but not in X), again with up or down arrows denoting the direction of fold change. The overlaps themselves show the 4possible options: up in both X and Y, down in both X and Y, up in X and down in Y, or down in X and up in Y. These are denoted by pairs of arrows,with the left-hand arrow referring to the direction of fold change in X and the right-hand arrow denoting the direction of fold change in Y e.g. in KC/Kvs. KCV/KC (D), 4 genes are up regulated in both comparisons, 2 are down regulated in both comparisons, 73 are up regulated in KC/K but downregulated in KCV/KC whilst 159 are down regulated in KC/K but up regulated in KCV/KC.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g002VZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896upregulated, 371 downregulated). Of the 107 genes differentiallyexpressed following viral infection in both differentiated andundifferentiated keratinocytes (KCV/KC and KV/K), 99 werefound to be upregulated and 8 downregulated in both comparisons(Figure 2E), suggesting a common role for these genes in hostresponse to viral infection regardless of differentiation. As we couldnot achieve 100% infection in either the KCV or KV samples(Figure 1), we must consider that the uninfected bystander cells inthese samples could also contribute to the overall gene expressionchanges observed.Only 31 genes were found to be differentially expressed in bothvirally infected (KV/K) and calcium treated (KC/K) conditions(19% KV/K, 2% KC/K) (Figure 2B), strongly suggesting thatviral infection does not drive differentiation. A similar analysis ofthe KCV/KC and KC/K comparisons identified 238 genes asdifferentially expressed in both contrasts (17% KCV/KC, 13%KC/K). However of these genes, 159 were upregulated in theKCV/KC comparison but downregulated in KC/K, whilst 73were downregulated in the KCV/KC but upregulated in the KC/K comparison. The direction of changes was the same for only 3%(6/238) of those genes differentially expressed in both conditions.This finding further supports the contention that VZV infectiondoes not drive differentiation and raises the possibility that VZVmay in fact interfere with or hinder it. Some of the effects seen inthe VZV infected samples that were calcium switched (KCV) werealso apparent in VZV infected samples that were untreated (KV).However the differences were not due solely to the effect ofcalcium on keratinocytes. If this were the case, we ought to seegood agreement between those genes differentially expressed inboth KCV/KV and KC/K. That this overlap is relatively small(85 genes: 5% total KC/K; 9% total KCV/KV) is in keeping withthe observation that the KCV samples were transcriptionallydistinct from both KC and K samples and reinforces the notion ofan interaction between VZV infection and the process ofkeratinocyte differentiation.In addition, there is only a relatively small overlap betweengenes differentially expressed following addition of calcium andthose differentially expressed upon addition of calcium and viralinfection (215 genes, 12% KC/K, 16% KCV/K). Of these genes,the direction of fold change is identical for almost all (91%, 50genes upregulated in both comparisons, 145 genes downregulatedin both comparisons) suggesting the KCV samples possess a moredifferentiated keratinocyte phenotype than the K samples.However, the vast majority of genes found to be differentiallyexpressed in the KCV/K comparison (1113 genes, 84% KCV/K)are not significantly up- or downregulated by the addition ofcalcium alone, further supporting the notion that changes in geneexpression between the K and KCV samples are not solely aconsequence of keratinocyte differentiation.Gene set enrichment analysis using the online DAVIDfunctional annotation resource [16] identified significantly en-riched functional groups (PBH,0.05) altered by either calcium(KC/K) (Figure 3A), by VZV infection of calcium differentiatedcells (KCV/KC) (Figure 3B) or by VZV infection of undifferen-tiated cells (KV/K) (Figure 3C). Genes upregulated by calciumtreatment of uninfected keratinocytes (KC/K) showed enrichmentfor several functional groups including cell cycle (GO:0007049)and cell division (SwissProt PIR keyword) whilst those that weredownregulated in this comparison included regulation of tran-scription (GO:0045449) and negative regulation of gene expres-sion (GO:0010629). The categories identified in the KCV/KCcomparison were more varied with enrichment in the upregulatedgenes for several functional groups including cell junction genes(GO:0030054), the ECM-receptor interaction pathway (KEGGhsa04512) and serine protease inhibitors (SwissProt keyword).Enrichment was also observed for additional groups such as celladhesion (GO:0007155), epidermis development (GO:0008544),serine proteases (SwissProt PIR keyword) and the integrin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0007229). Although relativelyfew genes were significantly altered by viral infection alone (KV/Figure 3. Representative functional groups enriched in differentially expressed gene lists. The genes which were differentially expressedin the (A) KC/K (B) KCV/KC and (C) KV/K comparisons were analysed using the functional annotation tool in DAVID. Enriched functional groups(Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P-value,0.05) were identified for each comparison and groups representative of overall enrichment results for eachcomparison are shown.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g003VZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896K), the upregulated genes showed functional enrichment forepidermis development (GO:0008544) and serine-type endopep-tidase activity (GO:0004252) as observed for KCV/KC. Althoughseveral interferon-stimulated genes were significantly changedafter VZV infection, the corresponding GO terms (GO:0071357)were not identified as being significantly enriched in either of theVZV infected conditions (KCV or KV).VZV replication dysregulates cytokeratin expressionA hallmark of epidermal differentiation are the changes thatoccur in cytokeratin (KRT) expression [6]. Basal cytokeratins(KRT5/14/15) are lost and suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10)are gained as the keratinocytes differentiate and migrate outwards.Gene-annotation enrichment analysis using the online DAVIDdatabase of both the KCV/KC and KV/K deduced that infectionwith VZV profoundly affected the development of the epidermis(Figure 3B\u2013C). Specifically, we show here that VZV alters theexpression of several epidermal cytokeratins, regardless of thedifferentiation status of the keratinocyte (Figure S5, Table S2). Theeffect of VZV infection on the epithelial cytokeratins wasindependently verified by qPCR and the fold change calculatedfor a direct comparison to the RNA-seq data (Figure 4A\u2013B). Agood concordance was seen between the methods. VZV infectionincreased the expression of KRT15, a stem cell marker located inthe hair follicle isthmus in both the KCV/KC and KV/Kcomparisons, although other stem cell markers (ITGB1, CD34and CD200) (data not shown) and other basal layer cytokeratins(KRT5/14) were not altered. At the same time, VZV either down-regulated or prevented up regulation of the suprabasally expressedcytokeratin heterodimers KRT1 and KRT10, which are the majorcytokeratins associated with keratinocyte differentiation [17] inboth the KCV/KC and KV/K comparisons. EM images ofdifferentiated keratinocytes infected with VZV show an abun-dance of cytokeratin structures (Figure S5). This finding may berelated to the upregulation of KRT4/13 (131-fold and 34-foldrespectively for the KCV/KC comparison, figure 4A), KRT4/13are normally present as heterodimers in the suprabasal layers ofmucosal but not stratified epithelium [18], and are thought tofunction like KRT1/10 to maintain cellular architecture. Upre-gulation of KRT4/13 may therefore have compensated structur-ally for the reduced expression of KRT1/10. To test whetherVZV replication was responsible for the reduction of KRT1/10expression, the qPCR experiment was repeated with UV-inactivated VZV (Figure 4C\u2013D). We again saw a downregulationof the KRT1 and KRT10 gene expression, but these changes werepartially abolished by pre-treatment of the viral inoculum by UVirradiation. We also determined the effect of VZV infection onKRT10 and KRT15 protein expression by western blotting.KRT10 expression was increased by the addition of calcium by24 hrs. However, in the VZV infected cells the KRT10 levels werereduced and this reduction was more pronounced by 48 hrs p.i. inthe undifferentiated cells, confirming that the virus downregulatesKRT10 regardless of the differentiation status of the cell. KRT15expression was upregulated by VZV infection at 48 hrs p.i. andagain this effect was not dependent on the addition of calcium.Further examination of the VZV infected keratinocytes byimmunofluorescence confirmed that not all cells were infected atday 5 p.i. but, KRT10 expression was absent in the ORF23GFPexpressing cells. However, KRT15 expression was widespread andnot necessarily confined to the VZV infected cells, confirming thatnot all the gene changes seen in our transcriptome data was adirect result of VZV infected cells and that changes in thebystander cells also contribute to the changes seen (Figure 4F).The transcriptome data was confirmed for KRT10 using akeratinocyte cell line, nTERTs. As with the primary keratinocytes,we were unable to achieve100% infection of the nTERTs even atan m.o.i. = 2 (as measured in MeWo cells) after 5 days and it waseasier to establish VZV infection in sparsely plated nTERTs (datanot shown). As the nTERTs become more densely populated, theexpression of KRT10 increased over the course of the experimentas measured by real time PCR. However infection of these cellswith VZV significantly reduced KRT10 gene expression(Figure 5A). The downregulation of KRT10 by VZV in nTERTswas also observed at the protein level (Figure 5B). At both 24 and48 hrs post infection the expression of KRT10 was reduced inVZV infected nTERTs compared to the mock infected controlsand pre-treatment of the viral inoculum with PAA, which inhibitsVZV DNA polymerase and viral replication restored KRT10expression (Figure 5C). To assess the expression of KRT10 in thepresence of VZV infection, the cells were examined by immuno-fluorescence. The nTERTs are a heterogenous cell population andnot all the cells express KRT10, as shown in the mock infectedcontrol (Figure 5D). However, KRT10 expression in VZV infectedcells was diminished, particularly in infected cells expressing thelate protein (gE) (Figure 5F). Closer examination of the VZVinfected showed that a number of cells where the expression ofORF62 was confined to the nuclei, which is indicative of an earlyVZV infection [19], still expressed KRT10 (Figure 5G\u2013H), whichin addition to the UV-treated virus and PAA data indicates thatthe effect of VZV on KRT10 is dependent on viral replication.To determine whether the VZV associated downregulation ofKRT10 seen in VZV infected keratinocyte monolayers occurredin more physiologically representative skin models, keratinocyteorganotypic rafts were infected with VZV. Organotypic raftcultures are an in vitro system that recapitulates epithelialdifferentiation and have previously been used to study VZVreplication in keratinocytes [20]. H&E staining revealed intact butswollen cells in the VZV infected raft, which are typically seen inearly VZV skin lesions (Figure 6A). KRT10 expression wasconfined to a continuous layer in the suprabasal region of themock-infected raft (Figure 6A vii) but disrupted in the VZVinfected raft (Figure 6A viii), with no expression of KRT10 seen inthe VZV infected pocket (indicated by VZV gE expression). Thesefindings were also confirmed in skin biopsy samples from VZVcases (Figure 6B\u2013G). As previously observed, KRT10 expressionoccurred in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and grossexamination suggested downregulation of KRT10 expressionrestricted to VZV antigen positive infected areas (Figure 6B\u2013C).KRT10 mean intensity was compared in uninfected and VZVinfected cells within the suprabasal layer of the epidermis. TenVZV positive and ten VZV negative cells were selected within thesuprabasal layer of the epidermis and the fluorescence of theKRT10 staining (red) was measured using ImageJ and found to besignificantly less in the cells staining positive for VZV gE(Figure 6D). As KRT10 forms heterodimers with KRT1 withinthe suprabasal layer of the epidermis [18], we also examinedKRT1 staining in a biopsy sample and carried out the sameanalysis of the fluorescence intensity in VZV positive and negativecells within the suprabasal layer (Figure 6E\u2013F). In agreement withthe KRT10 result, KRT1 expression was also substantiallyreduced in VZV infected cells (Figure 6G).VZV dysregulates desmosomesKRT1/10 bundles provide the cytoskeletal structure in thesuprabasal layers of the epidermis by interacting with desmosomalproteins [21].

At day 5,48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of epidermal cytokeratins were determined by qPCR and normalised to the housekeeping gene RN5S(B). The fold change between the uninfected and VZV infected samples with and without the addition of calcium was determined and plotted 6stdev. A representative graph from 4 individual experiments is shown and the dataset is comparable to the RNA-seq analysis for all the KRT genestested. The VZV inoculum was UV irradiated prior to infection and the qPCR was repeated for (C) KRT1 and (D) KRT10. Fold change was calculated forthe VZV and UV-VZV relative to the mock control for both genes, p-values,0.05 are shown (*). VZV infection again downregulated both KRT1 andKRT10, but the downregulation was not observed in the UV-treated VZV for KRT1 and was partially restored for KRT10. Quantification of VZV ORF68was used to confirm absence of viral transcripts in UV-VZV treated cDNA (data not shown). E) Protein extracts were analysed by immunoblotting forKRT10 and 215 at 24 and 48 hrs after the calcium switch. The VZV infected cells are denoted by the presence of the late viral protein gE and GAPDHwas used as a loading control. Change in density of KRT10 (F) and KRT15 (H) expression after the addition of calcium relative to the no calciumcontrol were calculated using imageJ from figure 4E after VZV infection (D) KRT1, (E) KRT10 and (F) KRT15. The change in relative density of KRT10 (G)and KRT15 (I) by VZV infection was calculated against the mock infected control at each timepoint. VZV infection reduced KRT10 expression andincreased KRT15 expression after 48 hrs regardless of the addition of calcium.

Both of thesegenes are intrinsically involved in the formation of tight junctionsand the process of epidermal differentiation normally increasestheir expression. From our trancriptome analysis we see that theywere upregulated by the addition of calcium (KC/K) by 9-fold and5-fold respectively (Figure S4, Table S3), but both genes weresignificantly downregulated by VZV infection (Figure 7A). Incontrast to Human Papillomavirus, another epitheliotropic viruswhich downregulates b4 integrin to dysregulate epidermaldifferentiation [22], VZV infection had no effect on the basalhemidesmosomal proteins (Table S3).Transcriptome data on the changes in desmosomal genes wereverified by qPCR (Figure 7B) and we confirmed that VZVinfection reduced the expression of both DSG1 and DSC1 at theprotein level by immunoblotting (Figure 7C). In the presence ofthe VZV gE protein the expression of both DSG1 and DSC1 wasreduced in comparison to the mock infected cells.

Desmosomes provide intercellularadhesive strength required for the integrity of epidermis, andelectron microscopy imaging of uninfected (Figure 7D+G), earlyVZV infection, as denoted by the presence of viral envelopes butnot intact virions (Figure 7E+H) and late VZV infection, wherevirus particles accumulate at cellular boundaries (Figure 7F+I)revealed that desmosomal junctions were no longer observed whenthe VZV infection was well developed. Addition of phosphonoa-cetic acid (PAA), which inhibits VZV DNA polymerase and viralreplication, also abrogated the down regulation of DSG1 andDSC1 in VZV infected cells as measured by qPCR (Figure 7J\u2013K).Since late but not immediate early viral gene expression ismodulated by PAA treatment, the reduction in desmosomalproteins in VZV infected cells may be due to proteins expressedlate in the replication cycle.Serine proteases as a group were significantly enriched in boththe VZV infected samples (KC and KV) (Figure 3B\u2013C).

Overall, themajority of the genes are significantly upregulated in the KCVsamples, with a similar but less pronounced upregulation also seenin the KV samples compared to K and KC (Table S4). Epidermalserine proteases, such as the tissue kallikreins participate indesquamation, the natural process by which individual corneo-cytes are shed from the surface of the epithelium [23]. Mutationsthat reduce the ability of the antagonist to inhibit the activity of theproteases, result in uncontrolled proteolytic activity associated withinflammatory skin conditions e.g. Nethertons syndrome [24]. Ourdata demonstrates that VZV upregulated the expression of themajority of the kallikrein genes (Figure 8B). The upregulation ofKLK5 and 27 was of particular interest due to their role incleaving DSC1 and DSG1 [25]. The upregulation of these genesby VZV could augment the downregulation of DSG1 and DSC1thereby further reducing cell-cell adhesion and the strength of theepidermal barrier to withstand mechanical trauma. The upregula-tion of the KLK5 and 27 genes was validated by qPCR(Figure 8C\u2013D respectively) and the effect of VZV on the KLK5and 27 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting in concen-trated supernatants from mock and VZV-infected differentiatedkeratinocytes (Figure 8E).The addition of calcium to infected keratinocytedifferentiation increases VZV gene expressionRNA-seq enabled analysis of both host and viral transcriptswithin the same sample. Paired-end reads from VZV infectedsamples were mapped to the pOKA genome (accession numberAB097933). Between 1.46105\u20131.26106 reads were mapped to theVZV genome (Table S1) with the exception of KV1 where thenumber of mapped reads was at least ten fold lower. Visualisationof the VZV transcripts for all infected samples using IGV(Figure 9A) revealed that all viral genes were expressed in allinfected samples, indicating that lytic viral replication wasoccurring under all conditions. This was also established byelectron microscopy examination of the infected cells, whichrevealed the presence of highly cell associated virus particles inboth VZV infected cells treated or untreated with calcium (FigureS6).Overall, the pattern of VZV gene expression was similar foruntreated and calcium treated cells, but the average number ofmapped reads was approximately 9-fold higher in differentiatedcells (KCV1\u20133) (Figure 9B). Significantly higher viral expressionwas observed in the differentiated cells compared to theundifferentiated cells for every viral ORF without exception andregardless of temporal classification (all ORFs up-regulatedbetween 4 and 15 fold; pFDR,0.01). Six viral ORFs weresignificantly changed by the addition of calcium (p,0.01) althoughonly ORF14 (gC) and ORF55 were significant (pFDR,0.01)following correction for multiple testing (Table S5) and when KV1was excluded due to low VZV reads only ORF14 remainedsignificant. The increase in viral gene expression was indepen-dently investigated by qPCR analysis for the three temporal classesof herpesvirus genes. No difference was seen in the expression ofthe IE gene (ORF63) at 48 hrs after the addition of calcium(Figure 9C), however the expression of the early (ORF29) and late(ORF14) viral genes was significantly increased in cells wherecalcium was added 3 days after VZV infection as per our model(Figure 9D\u2013E). The qPCR data did not reflect the degree ofchange and increase in VZV gene expression seen in the KCVsamples in RNA-seq data in comparison to the KV samples. Wewere able to demonstrate an effect of calcium on the viral DNAand observed a three-fold increase in VZV DNA as measured byreal time PCR after the addition of calcium to infectedkeratinocytes on day three (Figure 9F). Taken together, our data,whereby calcium induced differentiation of primary keratinocytesincreases VZV DNA replication and gene transcription, both ofwhich are required for the production of progeny virions impliesthat the process of differentiation increases VZV replication, but,we were unable to demonstrate that calcium differentiationinduced an increase in the number of VZV particles or replicationby either IF, infectious VZV foci or EM (data not shown).Pattern of VZV gene expression is altered by keratinocytedifferentiationIn common with other members of the herpesvirus family, VZVgene expression occurs in a temporally regulated cascade, whichcan be categorized as; immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L).When viral reads were normalised separately to human reads,distinct patterns of relative viral gene expression were observed forthe undifferentiated (KV) and differentiated (KCV) samples withineach sample (Figure 10A). A high degree of agreement wasobserved between the differentiated samples (KCV1\u20133) indicatingthat late viral genes were more highly expressed than immediateearly genes in the differentiated samples. Undifferentiated samplesKV3 and KV4 also showed good agreement, where in contrast toKCV1\u20133, the immediate early genes were more highly expressedthan the late genes. However, samples KV2 and KV5, despite nothaving been treated with calcium, had similar viral geneexpression patterns to the differentiated cells (KCV1\u20133). Analysisof 1463 host genes which are differentially expressed aftertreatment with calcium but not changed by VZV infection (i.e.representative of keratinocyte differentiation) showed clustering ofKV2 and KV5 host gene expression profiles with the calcium-shifted differentiated keratinocyte samples KCV1\u20133 (Figure 10B).This finding was supported by Spearman\u2019s rank correlationcoefficient (Figure S3) and principal component analysis of hostgene expression profiles (Figure S3), which again clustered samplesKV2 and KV5 with the calcium treated samples. Since KV2 andKV5 were not treated with calcium, it is likely that these replicatesunderwent spontaneous differentiation, something that is known tohappen when primary keratinocytes contact each other [26].These data illustrate the impact of keratinocyte differentiation onVZV gene expression as distinct from the effect of calcium. To testour hypothesis that it is differentiation and not the addition ofcalcium that is responsible for the increase seen in VZV geneexpression, the NOTCH pathway was activated by the addition ofthe agonist, jagged-1 and inhibited by the addition of DAPT. Thecanonical NOTCH pathway acts as a switch between the basalextraction. At day 5 p.i., 48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of the desmosomal genes were determined by qPCR and normalised to thehousekeeping gene RN5S (B). The fold change between the uninfected and VZV infected samples was determined and plotted 6 stdev. C) Immuneblotting to confirm decreased DSG1 and DSC1 expression in VZV infected keratinocytes.

Conversely a decrease gEprotein expression was observed relative to the untreatedkeratinocytes when the NOTCH pathway was ablated.To examine the effect of cellular differentiation on theregulation of VZV genes, we used a recombinant virusesexpressing either luciferase or renilla reporter cassettes undervarious VZV promoters (Figure 10D\u2013G). Keratinocytes wereinfected with one of the three viruses as per our model and thereporter activity measured over the course of 6 days. Reporteractivity for ORF4, ORF14 and ORF9 increased over thetimepoints taken whereas ORF63 remained relatively level. Inall viruses, the reporter activity was altered by the addition ofcalcium at day 3 post infection. With the reporter driven by animmediate early promoter (Figure 10D and F) there was adecrease in its activity after the addition of calcium whereas theconverse was true for the reporters driven by the late promoters(Figure 10E and G). The increase in ORF4 promoter activity inundifferentiated cells and not in the calcium treated cells as well asthe increase in the late viral promoter activity and viral early andlate gene products in the calcium differentiated cells suggests thatthere was a relative block to viral replication which was overcomeby keratinocyte differentiation.To investigate if the expression of the VZV proteins is affectedby differentiation in the epidermis, skin organ cultures wereintradermally injected with VZV to model skin infection andstained for IE and late proteins 3 days post infection (Figure 10H).Although epidermal infection throughout the section was evident,the explant model did not demonstrate epidermal blistering unlikethe in vivo archival specimens (Figure 6B\u2013G). VZV IE63 stainingwas found predominantly in the nuclei throughout the epidermisand the expression of late viral glycoprotein gE was largelycytoplasmic with increased expression of gE seen in the uppermostlayers of the epidermis. Together with the observed differentialgene expression as keratinocytes differentiate under calcium, theseresults indicate that VZV gene expression is tied to regulatedkeratinocyte differentiation, with a switch from more efficient earlygene expression at the undifferentiated stage to late geneexpression as differentiation ensues.DiscussionKeratinocytes, the predominant cell type found in theepidermis, are a major target of VZV replication in skin. Thecalcium switch method delivered a dynamic model of epidermaldifferentiation which can be manipulated to allow investigation ofviral and host interactions during synchronized keratinocytedifferentiation without the presence of other cell types.A number of alternative systems have been described toinvestigate the biology of skin, including 3D raft cultures andexplants [20], [28]. A further model, using SCID-hu mice, haspreviously been successfully used to study the infection dynamicsof VZV in vivo [13]. Both the 3D raft cultures and the explantsshow a greater degree of differentiation, formation and definitionof the structural layers characteristic of skin in contrast to thecalcium shift model utilised in this study. Furthermore, the explantsystem also contains the presence of specialised structures, such asthe sebaceous glands and hair follicles that are absent from raftcultures and the monolayer system. However neither the explantnor the SCID-hu mouse model was suitable for this study asneither system can be manipulated experimentally to allow theeffects of differentiation on VZV gene expression to be examined.In contrast, the development of 3D organotypic rafts whilstoffering a valid alternative model to allow investigation into theeffects of virus infection on cellular differentiation and vice versawas not found to be reliable enough, particularly in the presence ofvirus, for use in the RNA-seq part of our study.The model has certain disadvantages e.g. the genes associatedwith the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum are not expressed.The titre of virus produced in primary keratinocytes is at least 2logs lower than is seen in MeWo cells and remains highly cellassociated as we saw in our EM images. Thus although we wereable to show that calcium induced increases in gene expressionand viral genome replication, these were not associated with anincrease in the formation of infectious particles. Nonetheless, ourdata clearly demonstrate that, in common with the archetypalalphaherpesvirus HSV-1 [29] and previous observations [10,20],VZV appears to preferentially infect undifferentiated keratino-cytes. In epithelia, undifferentiated keratinocytes are localised tothe stem-cell rich basal layer of the epidermis and adnexalstructures. Our findings are consistent with histological evidence ofearly Herpes Zoster lesions that shows VZV infecting the stem-cellrich isthmus region of the hair follicle [30], following reactivationfrom latency and prior to the onset of the epidermal infection ordistinctive cutaneous rash. By adding calcium to VZV infectedundifferentiated keratinocytes our model therefore mimics thelikely sequence of events in the skin, with infection of lessdifferentiated basal cells followed by differentiation of infectedcells. The fact that VZV spreads more easily in undifferentiatedcells fits with the model of cell associated virus inhabiting basalepidermal layers while cell free virus in the upper epidermis isnecessary for transmitted infection [31]. Virus adapted for cell tocell spread in the basal epithelium has been shown to differ fromcell-free virus. For example, VZV can spread efficiently cell to cellin MeWo monolayers despite low levels of envelope glycoproteinC [32] a protein that is necessary for the formation of cell freeFigure 9.

The top three panels represent KCV1\u20133 samples and the lower 5 samples are KV1\u20135. A schematic representation of the VZV openreading frames is shown below. Each coverage plot uses an identical log scale, illustrating the higher degree of coverage in the KCV samples. Regionswith zero coverage are shaded grey. B) RPKM values for each of the VZV ORFs across the infected samples. The RPKM values are normalised relativeto the sum of human and viral reads per sample. The pattern of expression is similar across all samples with RPKM values for each ORF being greaterthan 1 in every sample. RPKM values for the KCV samples are less variable than those for the KV samples with a median 9-fold upregulation per ORF(KCV/KV, range 4\u201315 fold upregulation, all ORFs significantly upregulated with pFDRs,0.01). RPKM values for KV1 are noticeably lower than all othersamples. At day 5 p.i., 48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of three VZV genes were determined by qPCR and normalised to thehousekeeping gene RN5S, no amplification was seen in the mock infected controls (data not shown). The upregulation of KRT10 in the uninfectedcontrols was used as a marker to ensure that the addition of calcium had caused keratinocyte differentiation (data not shown). The expression of (C)ORF63 (IE) ORF29 (early) and ORF14 (late) genes was determined (n = 3) and plotted.

This fits with our resultsshowing increased late viral protein expression in the suprabasallayers where assembly of cell free virus occurs [31]. One model toexplain our results may therefore be that the generalised increasein viral gene and protein expression seen with keratinocytedifferentiation is directed to maturation of cell-free virions fromthe immature viral particles formed in the basal layers, rather thana large increase in numbers of virions. Over time, as keratinocytematuration continues, high titers of cell-free virions accumulate inthe growing blister.The blister lesions formed in VZV infections are by and largediscrete, although coalescence of mature lesions may occur. Whileproduction of interferon by bystander cells has been shown to limitviral spread in the skin [34] it is also possible that cell-to-cell spreadis limited by the physical barriers associated with keratinocytedifferentiation, thus explaining the reduced spread of virusobserved in differentiated cells. Alternatively, differentiation mayresult in the loss of a cellular receptor rendering keratinocytes lesspermissive to VZV infection. Of the three known putative cellularreceptors for VZV, mannose 6 phosphate receptor, reported to becritical for the accumulation of cell free virus in vesicles andHeparan sulphate are expressed only in basal layers and theexpression of both are lost as keratinocytes differentiate [31] [35].Both are therefore candidates for viral spread in less differentiatedbut not differentiated cells. In contrast, expression of the thirdputative receptor, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), increases askeratinocytes differentiate (Jones M. unpublished data).Notwithstanding the reduced cell-to-cell spread in differentiatedkeratinocytes, our analysis revealed a quantitative increase in viralgene and viral DNA expression after calcium induced differenti-ation and by manipulation of the NOTCH pathway as well as bycalcium and contact induced differentiation we were able to showthat this was dependent on differentiation and not just the additionof calcium to our cells. As previously outlined, these results are notnecessarily contradictory but are consistent with a model by whichthe virus is able to enter and spread in undifferentiatedkeratinocytes, but once infected, optimal replication and produc-tion of mature virions requires the presence or loss of cellularfactors present as cells differentiate. Although VZV does notpersist in the skin, it shows a pattern common to other skin tropicviruses. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which maintains its genomeas a stable episome in basal cells until differentiation of the host celloccurs [36] and the gamma-herpesviruses Kaposi SarcomaHerpesvirus (KSHV), whose lytic cycle is also known to beactivated by keratinocyte differentiation [37].In our model, expression of all VZV ORFs was evident in bothuntreated and calcium treated keratinocyte samples, confirmingthat VZV undergoes full lytic infection in both conditions.However, the distinct differences in the pattern of expressionwere clearly apparent, with relatively more immediate early genes(ORFs 4, 62 and 63) in the undifferentiated cells and relativelymore late genes (e.g. viral glycoproteins) expressed in thekeratinocytes that had undergone synchronized differentiation.The apparent association of each condition with IE or late viralgene expression suggests that the state of the host cell may impacton the regulation of the molecular switch controlling the classicaltemporal pattern of herpesvirus gene expression. Though notdefinitive proof, this hypothesis is supported by our observations.First, the expression of the VZV promoters in the recombinantviruses clearly establishes differential activity of the reporters inresponse to calcium induced keratinocyte differentiation. Thisblock in production of early and late viral proteins in undifferen-tiated keratinocytes is consistent with a requirement for cellularfactors present in differentiated cells to regulate the switch toearly/late gene expression. Secondly, the expression of gC, whichis essential for viral replication in skin [13], was significantlygreater in the calcium switched cells. This result corroboratesprevious work where increased gC expression was observed inMeWo cells treated with hexamethyl bisacetamide (HMBA), aknown inducer of cellular differentiation [32]. Finally, usingimmunohistochemistry we were also able to show that another lateprotein, gE, was more highly expressed in the upper layers of theepidermis in explants.Of interest, several VZV ORFs which, based on their HSV-1orthologues are presumed to be late genes, were more highlyexpressed in the undifferentiated cells. These include ORFs 17(virion host shutoff), 64 (tegument US10), 46 (tegument UL14), 27(nuclear phosphoprotein UL31), 60 (gL) and 23 (capsid). Furtherwork is required to determine whether these findings reflect truedifferences in VZV temporal gene expression or whether they areindicative of keratinocyte specific differences in the gene expres-sion patterns.Analysis of the host transcriptome confirmed VZV does notdrive keratinocyte differentiation. Instead the virus clearly altersthe normal pattern of gene expression associated with differenti-ation, generating a signature associated with skin blistering, whichitself is a characteristic feature of VZV disease. VZV downreg-ulated or prevented the expression of the suprabasal genes, KRT1and KRT10, but was not shown to alter the expression of otherdifferentiation markers such as involucrin. KRT1 and KRT10 areknown to play a role in maintaining the integrity of the epidermisand are mutated in other blistering diseases such as epidermolyticichthyosis [38]. KRT10 has also been shown to inhibit prolifer-ation and cell cycle progression of basal keratinocytes [39,40] andits loss is also associated with increased cell turnover [41].However, through its interactions with desmosomes, KRT1/10form a dynamic scaffold in the cell and play an important role inmaintaining epithelial structure [42]. Autoantibodies to desmo-somal proteins, DSG1 and DSC1 proteins are a hallmark ofblistering skin conditions including pemphigus foliaceus and IgAwith the exception of KV2 and KV5 which cluster alongside the calcium-shifted KC samples suggesting these 2 samples had undergone spontaneouscontact-induced differentiation. C) Primary keratinocytes were infected VZV at an mo.i. of 0.2 and treated with either DAPT [1 mM] or Jagged-1[50 mM] and harvested for analysis by immunoblotting 48 hrs later. Jagged-1 treatment caused an increase and DAPT treatment showed a decreasein Notch 1 expression respectively as seen in the uninfected keratinocytes. Treatment of VZV infected cells with jagged-1 increased gE expression andDAPT treatment decreased gE expression relative to the untreated VZV infected keratinocytes, the changes in gE were quantified using ImageJ andthe numbers below represent the gE expression relative to the untreated VZV infected keratinocytes. Primary keratinocytes were infected with VZV atday 0 with an m.o.i. of 0.2. At day 3 half of the samples were switched to a high calcium media. Duplicate samples were taken every 24 hrs to measureluciferase and/or renilla. Three different recombinant viruses were used D) VZVLUC under the control of an IE promoter (ORF4), E) ORF14Luc and F\u2013G)ORF63LucORF9Renilla. The average relative luciferase/renilla units RLU/RRU for each virus is plotted 6 stdev. H) Skin explants were injected into thedermis with cell associated VZV (1250 PFU), placed on grids, and harvested at 3 days post infection, fixed and embedded in paraffin. Sections werestained with antibodies against the immediate early viral marker, IE63, and the late marker glycoprotein E (gE). Staining was developed with thechromogen VIP. No staining was seen in the uninfected controls (data not shown). Although epidermal infection was evident, this model did notdemonstrate epidermal blistering. VZV staining is present throughout the epidermis and the expression gE was more apparent in the higher layers ofthe epidermis.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g010VZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 16 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896pemphigus [43]. As a group, the desmosomal genes, especiallyDSG1 and DSC1 were identified as being significantly altered byVZV infection while other junctional proteins were unaltered.These findings support the notion that the interaction of VZV withkeratinocytes drives the pathognomonic blistering phenotype. Theaccompanying upregulation of the serine proteases by VZV maycontribute to the observed reduction of DSG1 protein as well asinducing a desquamative phenotype, which may promote thedissemination of the virus.An unusual finding which is not typical of blistering disorderswas the upregulation of the mucosal cytokeratins 4 and 13, aphenotype previously observed in keratinocytes with impairedSMAD 2, 4 and 7 signalling [44]. Jones et al. previously observedsuch changes in the TGF beta pathway in a VZV infected SCID-hu mouse model [45]. Although we observe the same gene patternchanges as Buschke et al. in that we observed downregulation ofKRT1/10/DSG1 and upregulation of KRT4/13, we did not finda significant enrichment of the TGF-beta pathway as a whole. It ispossible that our transcriptome analysis, which was a singlesnapshot late on in VZV infection, failed to detect early signallingchanges responsible for KRT4/13 changes. Alternatively, VZVmay act via different pathways in this system.Other observed changes in cytokeratin expression which do notusually form part of a blistering signature include the upregulationof KRT15 and KRT19 which are associated with stem cells inadnexal skin compartments, a region which histologically ispositive for VZV early on in infection. KRT15 is also associatedwith wound healing, but other markers of keratinocyte activationin wound healing (e.g. KRT6, 16 and 17) [46] were unaltered inour transcriptome data.In summary, we have shown by combined analysis of host andpathogen gene expression at a single time point that VZV geneexpression is linked to keratinocyte differentiation. VZV replica-tion, in turn, alters the structure of stratified squamous epithelium,driving a blistering, desquamative phenotype to form the typicalskin vesicles, which are essential to VZV pathogenesis. The majorfunctional groups studied in the manuscript i.e. the alterationsaffecting cytokeratins, desmosomes and proteases, are controlledby a number of regulatory pathways and further work is underwayto untangle the complex molecular interactions between VZV andkeratinocyte differentiation. While the data presented here areonly a snapshot of this complex process, they provide a roadmapfor further exploration of how VZV interacts with a target cellcentral to its pathogenesis.Materials and MethodsEthics statementHuman skin from cosmetic reductive surgery was obtained withwritten informed consent under the approval of the East CentralLondon Research Ethics Committee 1 (10/H0121/39).CellsNeonatal primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn, Lifetechnologies, Paisley, UK) were cultured on mouse collagen IV(0.67 mg/cm2 BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) coated surfaces inkeratinocyte defined media containing epithelial growth factor(KDM and EpiLife, Life technologies). Differentiation was inducedby shifting the cells to a high calcium media containing [1.2 mM]calcium chloride. Neonatal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDFn,Life technologies) were cultured in medium 106 supplementedwith low serum growth supplement (Life technologies). MeWocells were cultured in MEM (Sigma, Dorset, UK) supplementedwith 10% (w/v) FBS and 1% non-essential amino acids. nTERTscells were cultured in 3:1 DMEM:Ham\u2019s F12 supplemented with10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine (200 mM) and Ready Mix Plus(0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 mg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF,5 mg/ml transferrin, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin and 13 ng/mlliothyronine). All uninfected cells were cultured at 37uC, 5% CO2.Skin explant cultureSegments of human skin (less than 2 cm2) were intradermallyinoculated with approx. 16105 infectious units of cell-free virusand cultured at the air-liquid interface in Dulbecco\u2019s modifiedEagle\u2019s and Ham\u2019s F12 medium (3:1), supplemented with 10%foetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and supplemented withRM+ (0.4 mg/ml Hydrocortisone, 5 mg/ml Insulin, 0.01 mg/mlEGF, 0.0084 mg/ml Cholera toxin, 5 mg/ml Transferrin and0.0013 mg/ml Lyothyronine) for 10 days. Mock-injected segmentswere cultured in parallel as a control. Skin samples were fixed in4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.VirusesInfections for transcriptome experiments were carried out usingpOka and validation experiments were carried out using a strainnamed THA, a low passage clade 3 clinical isolate. The VZVORF23 GFP, expressing an N terminal tag to the capsid OR23protein, has been detailed previously [47]. A recombinant VZVexpressing luciferase (VZVLUC) driven by ORF4 promoter wasdeveloped by cloning the ORF4 promoter upstream of theluciferase gene in the vector PGL3 (Promega Corp), followed byPCR amplification of the entire cassette and cloning into the pOkabased cosmid pspe23 at the unique AvrII site located betweenOR65 and 66. This was then developed into recombinant VZVwith additional pOka cosmids as described previously [48]. TheORF14-luciferase virus reports luciferase as a T2A directedribosome skipping motif fusion protein. Luciferase was amplifiedby PCR from the plasmid pGL3basic (Promega Corp) using theprimers 59 GAGGGATCCGGTTCCGGAGAGGGCAGAGGAAGTCTGCTAACATGCGGTGACGTCGAGGAGAATCCTG-GCCCAATGGAAGACGCC AAAAACATA-39 and 59 AATTC-GAATTCGCGCGCAGATCTTTACACGGCGATCTTTCCG-CCCTTCTTGGC-39. The resulting fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the vector pmCherryC1 cutwith EcoRI and BglII (underlined in primers), resulting in plasmidpmCherryT2Aluc which contained mCherry fused in frame toluciferase, separated by the T2A 22 amino acid ribosome skippingmotif. The expression of functional luciferase (containing a singleresidue added to the amnio terminal end) and mCherry (with a 21amino acid T2A C terminal addition) were confirmed in plasmidtransfected HEK293T cells (data not shown). The plasmid was cutwith EcoRI and BglII (both sites downstream from the T2Aluciferase gene) and a zeomycin resistance cassette was insertedfollowing its generation by PCR with primers to add bglII andEcoRI flanking sequences (underlined in the following primers 59AGATCTAGATCTCGAGTAATGGAACGGACCG TGTTG-A C-39 and 59 \u2013 GCTGAC GTCGACGAATTCTGATCACT-CAAGTTTCGAGGTCGAGGTG 39). The resulting plasmidwas used as the template for the PCR amplification of the entireT2A-Luciferase-Zeo cassette using primers with 40 bp flankinghomology arms to allow recombination into ORF14 in the pOkaBAC, so it was an in frame fusion with the terminal residue of gC(ORF14): using the primers gClucF2 59 CTTATCGCAGTTATCGCAACCCTATGCATCCGTTGCTGTTCAATGGACGAGC-TGTACAAG-39 and gClucR2 59 ATAAAATGATATACAC-AGACGCGTTTGGTTGGTTTCTGTCTCGAGTATGATCA-G TTATC 39. The PCR product was amplified, gel purified andtransformed for recombineering into pOka BAC [49] usingVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 17 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896pGS1783 bacterial host (a kind gift of Gregory Smith Northwest-ern University IL), a VZV pOka BAC detailed previously [50] andrecombineering methods detailed by [51]. Chloramphenicolresistant BACs also showing zeomycin resistance were validatedfor DNA integrity and correct insertion into ORF14. Virus wasderived by cotransfection of the BAC purified DNA into MeWocells as previously described [50]. VZV containing both ORF63-T2A luciferase and ORF9-T2A renilla reporters were generatedsimilarly. Renilla gene was first PCR amplified to add the T2Amotif to the N terminal end using the following primers and thetemplate pSV40 RL (Promega Corp) 5- AGAGGATCC GGT-TCCGGAGAGGGCAGAGGAAGTCTGCTAACATGCGGTG-ACGTCGAGGAGAATCCTGGCCCAATGACTTCGAAAGTTT-A TG -39 and 59 GAATTCGAATTCTGTTCATTTTTGAGAA-CTCGCTCAA-39. The EcoRI and BamHI digested product wascloned into pEGFP-C1 cut with bglII and EcoRI, to generate theplasmid pEGFPT2ARen. A kanamycin resistance cassette wasamplified from pEPS kan 2 [51] using primers that added flankingrepetitive sequences to allow subsequent recombineering removalof the cassette, using 59 AGATCTAGATCTAGGATGACGACGA-TAAGTAGG G-39 and ATTCGAATTCCGATGAACTCAG-TAGCATTATTGTTCATTTTTGAGAACTCGCTCAACGAA-CGATTTGATATCAACCAATTAACCAATTCTGATTAG-39primers. The BglII and EcoRI digested cassette was cloned intothe unique EcoRI and bglII sites downstream of the renilla cassettein pEGFPT2ARen. This was used as a template for PCRamplification of the entire T2A-renilla kanamycin cassette withprimers that added 40 bp homology arms to ORF9, so as to placethe cassette as a fusion to the C terminal residue of ORF9 (59-AGTAGGGCCCGTTCGGCATCAAGAACTGATGCGCGAA-AAATG GAC GAGCTGTACAAG -39 and 59- TTATACAT-AATACCGGGTAAACCGTTACTGCGTAATTAACTCGAG-TATGATCAGTTATC 39Recombinants of pOka BAC containing the cassette wereselected based on gain of kanamycin resistance. A secondrecombination event was induced concordance with ISce induc-tion [51] to remove the kanamycin cassette, and transformantswere screened for loss of kanamycin. The resulting pOka BACcontaining the ORF9-T2A renilla fusion was subjected to a thirdinduced recombination following transformation with a T2Aluciferase-Zeo cassette, amplified using primers to add flanking40 bp homology arms to enable recombination to the C terminusof ORF63 (59 GGAAAATATCAACATAAAATATATCATCG-TAAAAATTCGAGTATGATCAGTTATC 39 and 59 GCTC-CCGTCATAGCAAATACAAAGACAATTATTAGCGTAATA-ATGGACGAGCTGTACAAG 39. Zeomycin resistant positivetransformants were screened for integrity and correct insertionusing sequencing. Finally, a kanamycin resistant cassette wasinserted into ORF71 to prevent rescue of the ORF63-T2Aluciferase cassette by the duplicated gene using a fourth inducedrecombination. Virus was derived from the BAC on MeWo cellsand replicated efficiently as wild type (data not shown). The virusderived from the BAC contained deletion of ORF71, a fusion ofORF63 to T2A luciferase and a fusion of ORF9 to Renilla.VZV growth and infectionsAll viruses were cultured and used at less than 20 passages.Infected cell preparations were first treated with mitomycin C(0.05 mg/ml for 3 hrs) prior to freezing and subsequently titeredon Mewo cells; we routinely achieved viral titres of greater than16106 pfu/ml. Cell-free VZV was generated by a rapid freeze(liquid N2) and thaw (37uC), followed by removal of cellular debrisby low speed centrifugation. In comparison to the cell-associatedVZV, titres for cell-free virus were reduced by 1\u20133 logs and weachieved titres of approximately 16104 pfu/ml. For UV inacti-vated VZV, cell-free VZV supernatants were treated for 20 min at150,000 J/Cm2using a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene).For the transcriptome and subsequent confirmatory experiments,36104 HEKn cells per well of a 6 well dish were plated out at day0 and left for 48 hrs, one well was then used to calculate the celldensity and other wells were then inoculated with cell-free virus atan m.o.i of 0.2 as calculated by viral titration on Mewo cells. Thecells were cultured at 34uC, 5% CO2 for 3 days before eithermaintaining the changing the calcium at [0.6 mM] or increasing to[1.2 mM]. Parallel wells were used to confirm the percentage ofcells infected as measured by flow cytometry. For immunofluo-rescence, the experiments were carried out on a coverslip in a 24well plate using 56103 cells, which were infected with an m.o.i. of0.2. as above. other details are as above. Infection of nTERTs forPCRs and westerns were carried out in a 6 well plate, with0.256106 cells left for 24 hrs before infection with an m.o.i. of 0.2.For immunofluorescence, 16104 nTERTs were plated on acoverslip and infections carried out at an m.o.i. of 0.2 for 72 hrsbefore fixation with 4% PFA.HEKn were seeded onto a de-epidermilised dermis (DED) andcultured at the air-liquid interface, as previously described [52].Rafts were intradermally inoculated with approximately 16105infectious units of cell-free virus nine days post-lifting. Mock-injected segments were cultured in parallel as a control. Five dayspost-infection, all cultures were fixed in 4% PFA and embedded inparaffin.Library preparationTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life technol-ogies) and cDNA libraries were prepared using reagents andprotocols supplied with the mRNA seq kit (Illumina, Essex, UK).Briefly, poly-A tailed RNA was purified from 10 mg of total RNAusing oligodT beads. The purified RNA was fragmentedchemically and cDNA was synthesised using Superscript II(25uC for 10 minutes, 42uC for 50 minutes, 70uC for 15 minutes;Life technologies) primed with random primers supplied in the kit(Illumina). Unique adaptors were ligated to the cDNA and 200 bpfragments were size selected by agarose gel purification. Librarieswere validated by using a DNA high sensitivity chip (Agilent,Cheshire, UK) and quantified by Qubit analysis using the Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay (Life technologies).Illumina sequencingLibraries were sequenced with a 36 bp paired end read using aGAIIx sequencer (Illumina). Each library was loaded onto asequencing chip at a concentration of 16pM. The library wasamplified and the Read 1 sequencing primer was hybridised usingPaired end Cluster station reagents version 1 and 2 (Illumina). Thepaired end module (PEMx) was attached to the GAIIx sequencerfor Read 2 preparation. Each run was quality controlled byassessment of the Phix sequencing control, loaded at a concen-tration of 6pM per chip.Computational analysisSolexa sequencing and pipeline analysis was performed byJ.Porwisz (UCL Genomics), generating FASTQ files for eachsample using GenomeAnalyzer pipeline v1.4 (Illumina) andCASAVA v1.0 (Illumina). Paired end reads were mapped to hostand viral genomes (Homo sapiens (release 37) reference sequence(GRCh37/hg19); pOka sequence (pOka, GenBank referenceAB097933)) using BowTie [53], TopHat [54], SAMtools [55].Duplicate reads were then removed using PicardTools (http://picard.sourceforge.net) and read counts per gene generated usingVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene ExpressionPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 18 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896HTSeq-count (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq).R/BioConductor [56] were used to import the mapped countdata and the edgeR package used to normalise the data andgenerate lists of differentially expressed genes. Specifically, afiltering step was applied remove low expression genes withfewer than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples.Counts were then normalised using a trimmed mean of M-values [57] and fitted to a negative binomial generalised log-linear model (GLM), using empirical Bayes tagwise dispersionsto estimate the dispersion parameter for each gene [58].Differentially expressed genes were identified using GLMlikelihood ratio tests applying a FDR significance cut-off of0.01, unless otherwise stated. The gplots R library was used toconstruct heatmaps (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html). Functional classification of genes wasperformed using the DAVID online database (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) [16]. Gene expression heatmaps weregenerated using the MEV software suite [59], [60] (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html). Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) was usedto produce viral genome coverage plots [61]. The Venndiagram in figure 2B was generated using the online toolVENNY (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html).Real-time semi-quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR3 mg of total RNA was DNaseI treated before being reversetranscribed using MMLV reverse transciptase and randomhexamer primers (Promega, Southhampton, UK). qPCR wasperformed using a Rotorgene 3000 cycler (Qiagen, Manchester,UK) using 500 ng cDNA, specific primers [0.4 mM] (Text S1) andSYBR green master mix (Qiagen). Each gene was normalised to ahousekeeping gene (GAPDH or RN5S) and relative expressionshown as 22DDCt[62].Flow cytometryHEKn were fixed in 4% PFA, blocked in 10% Goat serum,washed in permeabilisation buffer (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK)and incubated with the anti-VZV-FITC (Millipore, Watford, UK)for 30 min in the dark. Cells were subsequently washed inpermeabilisation buffer, resuspended in PBS, processed by FACSCalibur and analysed using FloJo (v7.6.5).Western blottingCell pellets were lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPESKOH (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 2%w/v NP40, 0.5%w/v NaDeox-ycholate, 0.2%w/v SDS, 1 mM NaOrthovanadate, 1 mM EGTApH 7, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail(Sigma-Aldrich).

Membranes were incubated withantibodies (Text S2) and detected by ECL plus (GE, Buckingham-shire, UK).ImmunofluorescenceHEKn grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min atRT before being washed in PBS, incubated in NH4Cl [10 mM]for 10 min before being permeabilised with 0.05% (w/v) TritonX-100 on ice for 5 min. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA andincubated with the primary antibody (1:100) (Text S2) for 1 hr,followed by the Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Life Technolo-gies) (1:1000) for 1 hr. Cells were mounted in Prolong gold (LifeTechnologies) and visualized on a Zeiss Axiovision. Images wereanalysed using AxioVision Rel. 4.8 and ImageJ. Statistical analyseswere performed using Prism (GraphPad Software).Immunohistochemistry5 mM paraffin-embedded sections were processed using con-ventional techniques. Antigen retrieval was performed by heat-treatment of deparaffinised sections in 10 mM citrate bufferpH 6.0.

VZV antigen was amplified usingUniversal Elite ABC kit in conjunction with M.O.M BiotinylatedAnti-Mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and visualised usingfluorophore tyramide amplification reagent (Perkin Elmer LifeSciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Nuclear staining was visualisedby staining with Hoechst 33342 (Life technologies). Sections weremounted in Immunomount (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Loughbor-ough, UK) and images were captured using a Leica epifluores-cence microscope.Electron microscopyCells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 200 mM sodiumcacodylate buffer for 30 min, washed in buffer and secondarilyfixed in reduced 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferricy-anide for 60 min, washed in water and stained overnight in 0.5%Mg Uranyl acetate. The samples were then embedded flat in thedish in Epon resin.

Primary human keratinocytesgrown either in low calcium [0.6 mM] or high calcium [1.2 mM]cultures were processed for total RNA and protein extraction. Theincrease of CaCl2 concentration to 1.2 mM initiated cellulardifferentiation of human keratinocytes beginning at 24 hrs, asdetected by qPCR for (A) KRT15, a basal layer gene which wasdownregulated by the addition of calcium whilst KRT10 and IVL,(B\u2013C) markers of differentiation expressed in the suprabasal layerand granular layer respectively were increased by calcium.

Mean counts permillion (CPM) values are shown for each of the desmosomal andhemidesmosomal genes in each condition alongside log2 foldchanges and FDR corrected P-values for four comparisons (KC/K, KCV/KC, KV/K and KCV/KV).(XLSX)Table S5 VZV ORFs significantly up- or downregulatedby the addition of calcium. Sample conditions are denotedwith the following key: primary human keratinocytes (K); addition3.36104 I.U of VZV (V), addition of calcium to culture media (C)or both (CV). ORFs are listed in order of significance from KCV/KV comparisons (A) excluding and (B) including sample KV1.Differential analysis was performed using edgeR on TMM-normalised viral read counts alone. RPKM values are providedto enable comparison of relative transcript abundance withinsamples. (A) Only ORF14 is significantly up-regulated(pFDR,0.01) in KCV/KV when excluding sample KV1. (B) BothORF14 and ORF55 are significantly up-regulated (pFDR,0.01)when including sample KV1. Using a less stringent FDR cut-off(pFDR,0.05), ORF14, ORF55, ORF4 and ORF43 are signifi-cantly differentially expressed in both comparisons, ORF64 onlyin (A) and ORF57 only in (B).(XLSX)Text S1 List of all primer sequences used in thismanuscript.(DOCX)Text S2 List of all antibodies used in this manuscript.(DOCX)AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank J.Porwisz (UCL Genomics) for performing the IlluminaSequencing and Pipeline analysis, the nurses (Dept.
