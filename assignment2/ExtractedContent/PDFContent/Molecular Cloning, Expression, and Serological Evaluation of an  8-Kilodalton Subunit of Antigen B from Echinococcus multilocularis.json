The open reading frame of the cDNA clone encodes a polypeptidecomprising 85 amino acids with a 20-amino-acid NH2-terminal signal sequence, which was confirmed followingN-terminal sequencing of the native antigen. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the cloneencoding EmAgB8/1 is predominantly transcribed in larval E. multilocularis. The gene consists of two exons(encoding the signal sequence and mature protein) separated by a 91-bp intron. The mature form wasexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its antigenic reactivity was compared with that of a counterpart, an 8-kDasubunit of antigen B from Echinococcus granulosus (EgAgB8/1) by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) with serum samples from patients confirmed to have cystic echinococcosis (CE) andalveolar echinococcosis (AE). Recombinant EmAgB8/1 showed positive reactions in Western blots with 81.3%(65 of 80) of serum samples from CE patients and 40.6% (26 of 64) of serum samples from AE patients, whilerecombinant EgAgB8/1 showed positive reactions with 86% (43 of 50) and 42% (19 of 45) of the serum samplesfrom these CE and AE patients, respectively. By the ELISA, both EmAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/1 exhibited similarpositive reactions with 88% (44 of 50) of serum samples from CE patients and 37.8% (17 of 45) serum samplesfrom AE patients. Statistical analysis revealed that the sensitivity of EmAgB8/1 was comparable to that ofEgAgB8/1 for the serodiagnosis of echinococcal diseases. There was no cross-reaction with sera from patientswith cysticercosis, which often cross-react when native antigens are used for serodiagnosis.Echinococcosis in humans is a widespread and potentiallylethal parasitic zoonosis. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alve-olar echinococcosis (AE), caused by infection with the larvalstages of Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocu-laris, respectively, are the clinically and epidemiologically mostimportant forms of echinococcosis (21, 24, 30). These diseasesare coendemic in large areas of the Northern Hemisphere,including the northwest part of China (2, 13, 21, 30, 34). Earlydiagnosis and proper treatment of the diseases are importantsince the pathogenicity is high and the prognosis for patientswith echinococcosis, especially AE, is often poor. It is nowrecommended that imaging for the detection of a hepatic ab-normality is the first choice not only in areas where echinococ-cosis is highly endemic but also in developed countries whereAE is rare and should be followed by confirmation by serologywith specific antigens (8, 24, 32). For these reasons, substantialefforts have been made to establish sensitive and specific se-rodiagnostic methods (1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 23, 25, 31). During theprocess, two major diagnostic antigens, named antigen 5 (Ag5)and antigen B (AgB), were identified from E. granulosus hy-datid cyst fluid. These two antigens are considered the mostimportant antigens for the serodiagnosis of human CE (17, 33).AgB is a 160-kDa thermostable lipoprotein, which comprisesthree subunits with molecular masses of 8 to 12, 16, and 20 to24 kDa (18, 19). The smallest subunit (8 to 12 kDa) of AgB isstrongly immunogenic in patients with echinococcal infections;about 80 to 90% of serum samples from CE patients and 40%of serum samples from AE patients exhibit specific antibodiesagainst this antigen (15, 19, 20, 32).A full-length cDNA encoding an 8-kDa subunit of E. granu-losus AgB (EgAgB8/1) has been cloned by Frosch et al. (4),and another cDNA clone encoding a novel 8-kDa subunit ofAgB (EgAgB8/2) was characterized by Ferna\u0301ndez et al. (3).Both EgAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/2 have been considered the com-ponents of the smallest subunit of native AgB from E. granu-losus and may constitute the building blocks of the higher-molecular-mass subunits (5). Furthermore, a cDNA fragmentencoding an EgAgB8/1 homolog (referred as EmAgB8/1 in* Corresponding author.

However, the complete nucleotide sequence and theantigenicity of EmAgB8/1 for the detection of CE and AE byuse of patient sera have not yet been characterized.In the present study, genomic DNA and a full-length cDNAclone encoding EmAgB8/1 were isolated from E. multilocularisand characterized. The antigenicity of recombinant EmAgB8/1(rEmAgB8/1) was assessed by Western blotting (WB) and en-zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and comparedwith that of recombinant EgAgB8/1 (rEgAgB8/1).MATERIALS AND METHODSParasite material. Metacestodes were obtained from a Mongolian gerbil (Me-riones unguiculatus) experimentally infected with E. multilocularis, which wasoriginally isolated from a naturally infected vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) inHokkaido, Japan.Patients\u2019 sera. Serum samples were collected from the following groups ofpatients with AE and CE after appropriate ethical approval was obtained andinformed consent was obtained from the patients: 30 serum samples from pa-tients with CE in France (14) and 30 serum samples from patients with CE inChina confirmed by surgery; 20 serum samples from patients with CE in Aus-tralia confirmed by serology with Ag5 with or without surgery (17, 18), followedby WB and ELISA with AgB of E. granulosus hydatid cyst fluid at AsahikawaMedical College (AMC) (20) (Table 1); 45 serum samples from patients with AEdiagnosed by surgery plus Em18 serology at Hokkaido University Hospital andAMC; and 19 serum samples from patients with AE in France diagnosed bysurgery plus serology with a commercially available kit (14, 16). The major targetantigens were Em18, Em16, and AgB in a whole larval extract of E. multilocularis(10, 12, 14, 16). These serum samples were obtained from patients who had beenconfirmed to have CE or AE and do not necessarily represent samples takenfrom patients prior to their commencement of treatment surgically and/or che-motherapeutically. Twenty-three serum samples from patients who had otherhelminth infections and who were confirmed to be antibody positive for thehomologous antigens were obtained from the serum bank at AMC to evaluatethe specificity of rEmAgB8/1: 10 serum samples from patients with neurocystic-ercosis, 5 serum samples from patients with sparganosis, 3 serum samples frompatients with schistosomiasis mansoni, and 5 serum samples from patients withfascioliasis patients.Isolation of cDNA encoding EmAgB8/1. A cDNA library prepared from anE. multilocularis metacestode was used (28). In order to isolate full-length cDNAencoding EmAgB8/1, a fluorescein-labeled cDNA probe was synthesized by PCRby using the cDNA library as the template DNA. The primers used for probesynthesis were EmAgB8/1/F2 (5\ufffd-GGATCCGGATGATGGTCTCACCTCGACGTCG-3\ufffd [P2 in Fig. 1]) and EmAgB8/1/R (5\ufffd- GGATCCTATTTACCTTCAGCAACCAACTC-3\ufffd [P3 in Fig. 1]), designed on the basis of a previously pub-lished nucleotide sequence (4). Since these primers were also used for amplifi-cation of a region encoding the mature form, BamHI restriction sites (under-lined) were added to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. A guanine (boldface)was added to the 5\ufffd end of the forward primer to enable in-frame cloning into theexpression vector. PCR was performed with 200 \ufffdM each deoxynucleosidetriphosphate, 0.5 nmol of fluorescein-12-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,Mannheim, Germany), 20 pmol of each primer, 2 \ufffdl of the cDNA library, and 1U of Ex TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) in a total volume of 50 \ufffdl.The PCR conditions were programmed for initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min;3 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 56\u00b0C, and 2 min at 72\u00b0C; and 35 cycles of 30 s at94\u00b0C, 30 s at 65\u00b0C, and 2 min at 72\u00b0C, with a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C.As a result, an approximately 200-bp labeled cDNA probe was amplified (datanot shown). The cDNA library was screened by plaque hybridization with theDNA probe, and positive clones were detected with an enhanced chemilumines-cence random prime labeling detection system (Amersham Life Science, LittleChalfont, United Kingdom) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.The isolated phages were converted to plasmids by automatic site-specific re-combination in host strain Escherichia coli BM25.8 (Novagen, Madison, Wis.).The recombinant plasmids were then extracted by a miniprep protocol and in-troduced into strain E. coli JM109 (Promega, Madison, Wis.) for DNA sequencing.RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was prepared from E. multilocularis proto-scolex-rich metacestodes with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out with Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an oligo(dT)-labeled adaptorprimer [5\ufffd-CTGATCTAGAGGTACCGGATCC(dT)20-3\ufffd] for synthesis of thefirst strand of cDNA and primer EmAgB8/1/F1 (5\ufffd-ATGCGGTTCTGCCTTCTTC-TCGC-3\ufffd [P1 in Fig. 1]) and an adaptor primer (5\ufffd-CTGATCTAGAGGTACCGGATCC-3\ufffd) for PCR amplification. The RT-PCR products were purifiedfrom agarose gels by using a filter cartridge (TaKaRa), ligated into vectorpGEM-T (Promega), and subcloned into E. coli JM109. Twenty-four clones withthe expected insert size were picked and sequenced.Isolation of genomic clone of EmAgB8/1. A genomic DNA library preparedfrom E. multilocularis protoscolices (22) was screened by hybridization with afluorescein-labeled EmAgB8/1 cDNA probe, as described above. Bacteriophagelambda DNAs from positive clones purified with a Lambda mini kit (Qiagen)were directly sequenced.DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequencing was per-formed on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer with the ABI PRISM Big DyeTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, FosterCity, Calif.). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed byTABLE 1.

The alignment of sequences wascarried out with the CLUSTAL W program, available over the World Wide Web(http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/E-mail/clustalw-e.html).NH2-terminal sequencing of native EmAgB. Cyst fluid components obtainedfrom cysts developed in a mouse experimentally infected with larval tissue ho-mogenates of E. multilocularis were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinyli-dene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membranewas stained with 0.2% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, and the 8-kDa target bandwas excised for sequencing of the NH2 terminus. Sequencing was performed bythe Edman degradation method.Expression and purification of rEmAgB8/1. The region encoding the antici-pated mature form of EmAgB8/1 was amplified under the same cycling condi-tions and with the same primers used for probe synthesis. The PCR product waspurified from the agarose gel, digested with BamHI, and then ligated intoexpression plasmid vector pET-32b(\ufffd) (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysS)(Novagen) was used as the host cell. Protein expression was induced at 37\u00b0C for4 h in the presence of isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentra-tion of 1 mM. Recombinant protein fused with thioredoxin was purified with aHis Trap column kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was cleaved withenterokinase (Novagen) to separate the fusion partner. The recombinant pro-teins from each purification step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Preparation and purification of rEgAgB8/1. The E. granulosus gene regionencoding the mature form of EgAgB8/1 is intronless (25); hence, E. granulosusgenomic DNA was used to amplify the region of the mature form of EgAgB8/1.Genomic DNA was extracted from E. granulosus protoscolices collected from asingle hydatid cyst from a sheep at a slaughterhouse in Urumqi, China. Theregion encoding the mature form of EgAgB8/1 was amplified by PCR withprimers 5\ufffd-GATGATGGCCTTACCTGACGTCGAGGAGTGTGATGAAAATGATTGGCGAAGCGA and 3\ufffd-CTATTTACCTTCAGCAACCAACTCTCTGAGGTGGGACTTA, designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence ofEgAgB8/1 (4). The PCR was performed as described above for cDNA probesynthesis. Subsequently, an approximately 200-bp product was amplified andinserted into pET-32b(\ufffd) for protein expression (data not shown). The expres-sion and purification of rEgAgB8/1 were performed by methods similar to thosedescribed above for rEmAgB8/1.Protein assay. The protein concentration was estimated by using a BCAProtein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).WB. SDS-PAGE and WB were carried out as described by Ito et al. (9). Inbrief, approximately 1 \ufffdg of either rEmAgB8/1 or rEgAgB8/1 was separated ontwo-dimensional 4 to 20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (width, 6 cm; Tefco,Tokyo, Japan) and transferred electrophoretically onto PVDF membranes. Eachmembrane was cut into 50 strips and probed with diluted human serum (1:50).Bound antibody was detected by using rec-protein G-peroxidase conjugate(Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, Calif.) at a 1:1,000 dilution and4-chloro-1-naphthol (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a final concentration of0.05% as the substrate.ELISA. ELISA was performed as described by Verastegui et al. (33), withslight modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtitration plates (Maxisorp; Nunc,Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with either rEmAgB8/1 or rEgAgB8/1 (100\ufffdl/well) at a concentration of 1 \ufffdg of protein per ml in 10 mM carbonate buffer(pH 9.6). Serum samples were diluted 1:200 in blocking solution (1% casein in 20mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6] containing 150 mM NaCl) and tested in duplicate. Boundantibody was detected by using the rec-protein G-peroxidase conjugate at a1:2,000 dilution in blocking solution. As the substrate, 100 \ufffdl of 2,2\ufffd-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to eachwell (0.3 mg/ml in 50 mM citrate buffer [pH 4.7]) and the plate was incubated at37\u00b0C. Color development was terminated by addition of 100 \ufffdl of 1% SDS after15 min. The optical density at 405 nm was monitored with a microplate reader(ImmunoMini, model NJ-2300; Nalge, Nunc, Japan). Cutoff values were estab-lished as four times the optical density of pooled serum samples from 30 healthydonors.Statistical analysis. The serological data obtained with antigens rEmAgB8/1and rEgAgB8/1 were tested by the chi-square test with 95% confidence.Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The cDNA and amino acid se-quences of EmAgB8/1 and clones EmAgB8/1a, EmAgB8/1b, and EmAgB8/1cand the genomic DNA sequence for EmAgB8/1 are deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession numbers AB100403, AB100404,AB100405, AB100406, and AB112079.RESULTSCharacterization of EmAgB8/1 and RT-PCR analysis. Thir-teen positive clones were isolated from approximately 2 \ufffd 105recombinant phage by plaque hybridization. Nucleotide se-quence analysis revealed that all 13 clones had overlappingsequences, with the longest one being 352 bp (Fig. 1). Theputative open reading frame consisted of 255 bp encoding aFIG. 1.

The cDNA andamino acid sequences are deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankdatabase under the accession numbers provided in Materials andMethods. The sequences of EgAgB8/1 and Ag1V1 of T. solium wereobtained from the EMBL data bank (accession numbers Z26336 andAB044081, respectively).1084 MAMUTI ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.polypeptide consisting of 85 amino acids with a 20-amino-acidNH2-terminal hydrophobic region and a mature form. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of native EmAgB8/1 revealedthat the cleavage site for a signal sequence is present betweenAla20 and Asp21 (Fig. 2, arrow). The molecular mass of themature form was estimated to be approximately 7.6 kDa, a sizecorresponding to that of EgAgB8/1 (4). Comparison of theamino acid sequences revealed that the sequence of the ma-ture form of EmAgB8/1 showed 92.6% homology with that ofEgAgB8/1.Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products revealed thatfour different cDNAs encoding EmAgB8/1 were obtained fromlarval E. multilocularis. Twenty-one of 24 clones examined hadsequences identical to that of EmAgB8/1 (AB100403) clonedfrom the cDNA library, but the sequences of another threeclones, designated EmAgB8/1a (AB100404), EmAgB8/1b(AB100405), and EmAgB8/1c (AB100406), were differentfrom the sequence of EmAgB8/1 and those of each other. Incomparison with the sequence of EmAgB8/1, the Lys atposition 39, the Met at position 64, and the Ser at position30 were replaced by Arg, Ile, and Gly in EmAgB8/1a,EmAgB8/1b, and EmAgB8/1c, respectively (Fig. 2). Theseamino acid substitutions resulted in 97.6 to 98.5% and 91.4to 92.6% homologies among the four different clones ofEmAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/1, respectively. By contrast,EmAgB8/1 has only 20% homology with the serodiagnosticprotein Ag1V1 of Taenia solium (28).Structure of EmAgB8/1 gene. A 1,780-bp genomic DNA frag-ment (AB112079) was isolated from an E. multilocularis pro-toscolex genomic DNA library. The EmAgB8/1 gene consistsof two exons and a 91-bp intron inserted at the junction be-tween the sequence encoding the signal peptide and the ma-ture protein, and these also occur in the homologous gene in E.granulosus (26).Expression and comparison of antigenicities of rEmAgB8/1and rEgAgB8/1. Both rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 were suc-cessfully expressed in E. coli as soluble fusion proteins withthioredoxin. The fusion proteins were purified from bacteriallysate, and the fusion moieties were removed by cleavage withenterokinase. Finally, purified rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1(Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were used for subsequentserological tests.The antigenicity of purified rEmAgB8/1 was compared withthat of rEgAgB8/1 by WB and ELISA with sera from patientsconfirmed to have CE and AE. The results obtained by sero-logical tests with the two recombinant antigens are summa-rized in Table 1. By WB, rEmAgB8/1 showed positive reactionswith 81.3% (65 of 80) of serum samples from patient with CEand 40.6% (26 of 64) of serum samples from patient with AE,and rEgAgB8/1 also reacted with 86% (43 of 50) of serumsamples from patient with CE and 42% (19 of 45) of serumsamples from patient with AE. Representative data are shownin Fig. 4. Most of the serum samples from patients with CE andAE showed very similar reactivities with both recombinantantigens; the exceptions were two serum samples from patientswith CE (the result for one sample is shown in Fig. 4, lane8) and one serum sample from a patient with AE (data notshown), which failed to produce visible bands reactive withrEmAgB8/1, while they were positive for reactivity withrEgAgB8/1. By ELISA, both recombinant antigens were co-incidently detected by 88% of 50 serum samples from pa-tients with CE and 37.8% of 45 serum samples from patientswith AE (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Statistical analysis revealedthat there was no significant difference between the reactiv-ities of rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 for the detection of anti-gens in the sera of patients with CE and AE by WB.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the complete nucleotide sequence of EmAgB8/1from E. multilocularis, an EgAgB8/1 homolog, was determinedand the antigenicity of the recombinant protein was evaluated.Sequence analysis revealed that EmAgB8/1 consists of a signalsequence and a mature form, similar to EgAgB8/1, which waspredicted to be a secretory protein (4). NH2-terminal sequenceanalysis of the smallest subunit of native AgB of E. multilo-cularis confirmed the cleavage site for the signal sequence ofEmAgB8/1. Genomic DNA sequence analysis revealed thatthe gene structure of EmAgB8/1 is similar to that of EgAgB8/1(26).Four different cDNAs encoding EmAgB8/1 with singleamino acid substitutions were obtained by RT-PCR analysis.Sequence analysis revealed that 21 of 24 clones had sequencesidentical to that of EmAgB8/1 cloned from the cDNA library,indicating that EmAgB8/1 is predominantly transcribed in thelarval stage of E. multilocularis.Although the EmAgB8/1 antigen described here was derivedfrom an E. multilocularis isolate from Hokkaido, Japan, thecoding region for the mature form was found to show 100%homology with that of EmAgB8/1 from E. multilocularis iso-lates from Europe (4). This observation suggests that EmAgB8/1is conserved among geographically different isolates of E. mul-tilocularis.Homology analysis revealed that EmAgB8/1 is 92.6% ho-mologous to EgAgB8/1 at the amino acid level. This mayexplain the high level of cross-reactivity of the smallest subunitof AgB in E. granulosus with sera from AE patients, as re-ported in several serological studies (9, 15, 32). The results ofour serological tests with rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 alsorevealed that more than 80% of serum samples from patientsFIG. 3. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1.Approximately 1 \ufffdg of each sample were separated on a 4 to 20%polyacrylamide gradient gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.Lane 1, prestained protein markers (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.); lane2, purified rEmAgB8/1; lane 3, purified rEgAgB8/1.VOL. 42, 2004 EVALUATION OF E. MULTILOCULARIS ANTIGEN B 1085with CE and about 40% of serum samples from patients withAE exhibited positive reactions with both antigens. Eventhough rEmAgB8/1 was isolated from E. multilocularis, itshowed more reactivity with serum samples from CE patientsthan from those from AE patients (Table 1; Fig. 4 and 5).Furthermore, it has been reported that a short region (EVKYFFER, residues 17 to 24) of the NH2-terminal region of theEgAgB8/1 mature protein is a major immunodominant regionof the molecule; in particular, residues Glu17, Lys19, Tyr20, Glu23,and Arg24 were considered the most important (6). We havefound that these residues are also conserved in EmAgB8/1(Fig. 2), suggesting that EmAgB8/1 has an immunoreactiveregion very similar to that of EgAgB8/1 and is similarly recog-nized by immunoglobulin G antibodies in serum samples fromCE and AE patients.In a serological study performed in order to evaluate thespecificity of the recombinant antigen, EmAgB8/1 did not showcross-reactivity with sera from patients with neurocysticercosisor other helminth infections (data not shown). A T. soliumlow-molecular-weight antigen (TsolAg1V1) is highly reactivewith homologous sera from patients with neurocysticercosisbut is not cross-reactive with heterologous sera from patientswith CE and AE (29), although sera from patients with thesediseases were highly cross-reactive when native antigens wereused. Antigens from both E. multilocularis and T. solium be-long to a hydrophobic ligand binding protein family (27), butthey have only 20% homology to each other at the amino acidlevel. The lack of cross-reactivity in serological tests reflects thelow level of amino acid homology between the two antigens(Fig. 2).Although sera from all 45 AE patients examined in thisstudy had antibodies against Em18, a specific serological mark-er for AE (14), only about 40% of these serum samples showedantibody responses against rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1. Thus,the humoral responses against AgB in patients with AE appearto be variable, depending on host-parasite interactions duringthe infection. The limitations to the sensitivity of the AgB8/1FIG. 4.

The broken lines indicate the cutoff values for rEmAgB8/1(A405 \ufffd 0.120) and rEgAgB8/1 (A405 \ufffd 0.170), respectively. The cutoffvalues were set at four times the optical density for the negative pooledserum sample.1086 MAMUTI ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.recombinant antigens for serodiagnosis found here were ap-parent when sera that were predominantly obtained from pa-tients after they had been surgically or clinically confirmed ashaving CE or AE were used. The diagnostic value of theseantigens would be most effectively determined with serum sam-ples from patients prior to the commencement of treatmentand samples with a spectrum of serological reactivities in otherdiagnostic tests for echinococcosis. In patients with AE, thealveolar-like cysts of E. multilocularis usually contain only aminute volume of cyst fluid; however, some AE patients, es-pecially patients with advanced cases, have cysts with consid-erable amounts of cyst fluid. We have no critical data on thecorrelation of the antibody response to AgB and the thresholdvolume of cyst fluid. The difference in the antibody responseagainst AgB in AE patients might be due not only to the sizeand the stage of development of the parasite but also to thegenetic background of the host. According to our presentknowledge, the mechanisms of the host-parasite interactionunderlying such a distinctive humoral response against AgB inpatients with AE are still unclear.In conclusion, EmAgB8/1 presents antigenicity comparableto that of EgAgB8/1 for the detection of immunoglobulin Gantibodies in sera from patients with echinococcosis, but thesensitivity of the antigen for the detection of antibodies in thesera of patients with AE was not increased. Hence, the recom-binant AgB8/1 antigens can be used for the specific serodiag-nosis of hydatidosis, although these antigens are not able todifferentiate CE from AE and the sensitivities of the antigensfor the detection of AE alone is poor. Further work is beingperformed to investigate the host-parasite interactions duringthe humoral response against EmAgB8/1 in seropositive andseronegative AE patients.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the JapanSociety for Promotion of Science (grants 12557024 and 14256001), agrant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (grant 1 R01TW01565-01; principal investigator, P.
