GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) induces apoptosis of some tumor cells by inhibiting proteasome and Notch activity.Alterations in these two cell survival regulators contribute to apoptosis resistance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby GSI I increases apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Time-course studies indicatethat initial apoptotic events are inhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress apoptotic signaling, and a consistent Noxa protein up-regulation. These events precede, and some of them contributeto, mitochondrial alterations, which occur notwithstanding Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I. In CLL cells, GSI I inhibitsNotch1 and Notch2 activation only in the late apoptotic phases, suggesting that this event does not initiate CLL cellapoptosis. However, Notch inhibition may contribute to amplify GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, given that Notch activationsustains the survival of these cells, as demonstrated by the evidence that both Notch1 and Notch2 down-regulation by small-interfering RNA accelerates spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis. Overall, our results show that GSI I triggers CLL cell apoptosis byinhibiting proteasome activity and enhancing ER stress, and amplifies it by blocking Notch activation. These findings suggestthe potential relevance of simultaneously targeting these three important apoptosis regulators as a novel therapeutic strategyfor CLL.Key words: chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell apoptosis, c-secretase inhibitor I, proteasome, endoplasmic reticulum stress, NotchAbbreviations: ASK1: apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1; Bak: Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; Bap 31: B-cell receptor-associationprotein 31; Bax: Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma protein-2; Bfl/A1: Bcl-2-related protein A1; BH3: Bcl-2 homologydomain; Bim: Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death; CHOP/GADD153: C/EBP homologous protein/Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 153;CHX: cicloheximide; CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; COX IV: cytochrome oxidase IV; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; DSHB:Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated degradation; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSI: c-secretase inhibitor; Hes1: hairy and enhancer of split 1; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme1; Mcl-1: myeloidcell leukemia-1; NICHD: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Omi/HtrA2: high temperature requirement serineprotease A2; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PI: propidium iodide; SAPK/JNK: stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase;Smac/DIABLO: second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI; TRAF2: TNF receptor-associatedfactor2; ZAP-70: f-chain-associated protein-70; z-LEVD-fmk: Z-Leu-Glu (OMe)-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone; z-VAD-fmk:benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone.Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.*R.S. and F.D.F. contributed equally to this studyGrant sponsor: Progetti di Ricerca di Interesse Nazionale-PRIN (2008); Grant number: Prot. 2008YSSL7B_003; Grant sponsor: FondazioneCassa di Risparmio di Perugia, Italy (2009); Grant number: 2009.020.0086; Grant sponsor: Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul CancroDOI: 10.1002/ijc.27863History: Received 29 Mar 2012; Revised 31 Aug 2012; Accepted 3 Sep 2012; Online 24 Sep 2012Correspondence to: Emanuela Rosati, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, ViaEnrico dal Pozzo, Padiglione-W, 06126, Perugia, Italy, Tel.: \u00fe39-075-5855830, Fax: \u00fe39-075-5855827, E-mail: erosati@unipg.itCancerTherapyInt. J. Cancer: 132, 1940\u20131953 (2013) VC 2012 UICCInternational Journal of CancerIJCChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized byaccumulation of malignant B CD5\u00fe cells, which are resistantto apoptosis.1 Despite standard treatments and more recenttargeted therapies,2 CLL is still incurable. Given that in CLL,multiple pathways are dysregulated,1,3 and considering thattargeting one single pathway is often not sufficient to elimi-nate tumor cells,4,5 it is necessary to develop novel strategiesable to activate multiple apoptotic pathways and, simultane-ously inhibit dysregulated survival pathways.c-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) include a wide range of smallmolecules proposed for therapy of malignancies driven by anaberrant Notch activity.6 A dysregulated Notch signaling hasbeen associated with the pathogenesis of several malignan-cies,7 and GSIs have been shown to inhibit the growth and/or survival of several tumor cells,8 including CLL cells.9 SomeGSIs have also been tested in phase I trials for patients withbreast cancer10 and T-cell acute leukemias.11 However, inthese malignancies, minimal clinical responses have beenobserved, and other studies have also suggested that Notchinhibition is therapeutically effective only when combinedwith inhibition of other relevant pathogenic pathways.12\u201314 Ithas been recently shown that GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), atripeptide aldehyde inhibiting chymotryptic and aspartyl pro-tease activity, chemically similar to the proteasome inhibitorMG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO),15 induces apoptosis inbreast16,17 and glioblastoma tumor cells,18 and in precursor-Bacute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells19 by inhibiting bothc-secretase and proteasome activity or only proteasome activ-ity.17 The ability of GSI I to target both Notch and protea-some can render it more effective in inducing antitumoractivity in those tumor cells where dysregulated survival and/or growth are associated with alterations in both Notch sig-naling and proteasome activity. This might be also the caseof CLL cells, given that both a constitutive Notch activation9and an up-regulated activity of ubiquitin-proteasome path-way20 contribute to their apoptosis resistance. Furthermore,the evidence that in CLL, the clinical use of the highly spe-cific proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been associatedwith poor antitumor responses,21 suggests that the only inhi-bition of proteasome is not sufficient to kill CLL cells.One mechanism by which proteasome inhibitors mediateantitumor activity is that they prevent the clearance of mis-folded proteins by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associateddegradation (ERAD) pathway,22 resulting in protein accumu-lation in the ER and ER stress-induced apoptosis.23 Impor-tantly, CLL cells have a functional ER stress-associatedapoptotic signaling, and are susceptible to both pharmaco-logic and genetic ER targeting strategies.24,25Based on all the above observations and our previousfindings that GSI I increased CLL cell apoptosis and inhibitedNotch activation,9 we investigated whether an inhibited pro-teasome activity and an increased ER stress signaling are alsoinvolved in GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, and examinedhow these events and Notch inhibition contribute to this ap-optosis. Clarifying the effects of GSI I on these three criticalregulators of CLL cell survival may be important to designmore effective therapies for this leukemia. Results show thatinhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with anincreased ER stress signaling and a consistent Noxa proteinup-regulation, are critical initial events for GSI I-inducedCLL cell apoptosis. After these effects, GSI I also inhibitsNotch activation, event that contributes to amplify CLL cellapoptosis.Material and MethodsPatientsTwenty-two CLL patients entered this study. Diagnoses ofCLL were performed according to the National Cancer Insti-tute-sponsored Working Group guidelines,26 and clinicalstaging was based on the Binet classification.27 This studywas approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all patientssigned informed consent in accordance with the HelsinkiDeclaration.Cell purification and culturePeripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated fromheparinized blood of CLL patients by Ficoll density-gradientcentrifugation (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). Monocytes wereremoved by plastic adherence, and T cells by sheep erythro-cyte rosetting. All CLL samples contained more than 96%CD19\u00fe/CD5\u00fe CLL cells, as assessed by flow cytometry(EPICS-XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).Freshly isolated CLL cells, resuspended at 2 \ufffd 106 cells/mlin complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplementedwith 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; HycloneLaboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml peni-cillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Mi-lan, Italy), were incubated in culture tubes (3 ml/tube) at37\ufffdC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The c-secretase inhibitor I(GSI I; Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), the pan-caspase inhibitorz-VAD-fmk, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (all fromWhat\u2019s new?GSI-I is a c-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that can induce apoptosis in some tumor cells. In this study of primary chroniclymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, the authors report that GSI I can increase apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant cells via threekey cell-survival regulators: proteasome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Notch. Given that several apoptotic pathways aredysregulated in CLL, this type of multi-targeted agent may prove to be more effective than highly selective drugs in blockingtumor-cell growth and survival. These findings may thus have important therapeutic implications.CancerTherapyRosati et al. 1941Int. J. Cancer: 132, 1940\u20131953 (2013) VC 2012 UICCCalbiochem, La Jolla, CA), the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk (BioVision, Mountain View, CA), and the translationalinhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,MO) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) anddiluted in complete medium at the used concentrations,which did not exceed 0.01% and did not affect CLL cellviability.CLL clinical laboratory characteristicsTo investigate VDJ rearrangement, genomic DNA was ampli-fied using a mixture of sense primers annealing to the VH1through VH6 FR1 and anti-sense primers complementary tothe germ line JH regions.28 For somatic hypermutation analy-sis, PCR products were gel purified (Qiagen Gel PurificationKit; Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and directly sequenced by the auto-matic DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 3130 (Applied Biosystems,Warrington, UK). The National Center for BiotechnologyInformation (NCBI) Ig Blast database and sequence align-ment tool was used to identify and compare sequences withthe most homologous germline VH gene family. VH genesequences deviating more than 2% from the correspondinggermline gene were defined mutated. CD38 surface expres-sion and ZAP-70 intracellular expression in CLL cells wereexamined as previously described.24,29Supporting Information Table 1 gives clinical laboratorycharacteristics and the Binet stage of CLL patients.Mutation analysis of NOTCH1The NOTCH1 exon 34 mutation previously identified inCLL30 was analyzed by PCR amplification as described else-where31 and frequencies were determined using the NCBIdatabase. Cycling conditions were: 95\ufffdC for 5 min (onecycle); 95\ufffdC for 45 sec; 58\ufffdC for 45 sec; 72\ufffdC for 1 min for36 cycles; 72\ufffdC for 6 min (one cycle). After direct sequencingfrom both strands, purified amplicons were compared withcorresponding germline sequences, and germline polymor-phisms in the NCBI SNP database were excluded.OP9 cocultureOP9 bone marrow stromal cell line was maintained inIMDM containing 20% FBS, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodiumpyruvate, 1 mM L-glutamine, 30 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. One day beforethe experiment, OP9 cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 \ufffd105/well). Cocultures were initiated by seeding in each well,precoated with OP9, CLL cells resuspended at 3 \ufffd 105/ml incomplete medium (3 ml/well) containing GSI I. After 36 hrof coculture, CLL cells were removed from the monolayer.Contamining OP9 cells were eliminated filtering the har-vested CLL cells through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD Falcon;Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). CLL cell purity was greaterthan 99%, as revealed by flow cytometric analysis of CD45expression. Neither DMSO nor GSI I affected the OP9monolayer integrity.MTS assayThe effect of GSI I on viability of OP9 cells was assessedby 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay,using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent (Promega,Madison, WI). OP9 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 \ufffd103/well), allowed to adhere for 1 day and then exposed toGSI I or DMSO as control. After 36-hr incubation, MTS rea-gent was added to the wells and after 2-hr incubation at37\ufffdC, absorbance was measured in a plate reader at 490 nm.Apoptosis assayApoptosis was assessed by flow cytometric analysis (EPICS-XL-MCL) of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells. Annexin V/PI assay wasperformed using a commercial kit (Immunotech; BeckmanCoulter) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and cytosolic and mitochondria-enrichedfractions were prepared as previously described.24 Equalamounts of proteins were separated by 7.5 to 15% SDS-PAGEand transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

Signals were detected using appropriate horseradish perox-idase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system(GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). Densitometric analysis was per-formed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).Real-time quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and 1 lgreverse-transcribed using RT-kit plus (Nanogen AdvancedDiagnostics, Milan, Italy). Real-time quantitative PCR wasperformed with PCR Master Mix Power SYBR Green(Applied Biosystems), using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCRSystem (Applied Biosystems).The primer sequences used for NOXA were forward: 5\u2019-GCTGGAAGTCGAGTGTGCTA-3\u2019 and reverse: 5\u2019-CCTGAGCancerTherapy1942 GSI I induces apoptosis in CLL cellsInt.

In Mcl-1 experiments,cells were cultured for 24 hr in 12-well plates in completemedium. In Notch1 and Notch2 experiments, cells were cul-tured for 72 hr in 12-well plates in supernatants harvestedfrom 48-hr cultures of OP9 cell line, to minimize spontane-ous apoptosis of siControl transfected cells that could obscurethe effect of Notch1 and Notch2 silencing.Statistical analysisStatistical differences between mean values were evaluatedusing the Student\u2019s t test. The minimal level of significancewas p < 0.05.ResultsGSI I increases apoptosis of CLL cellsCLL cells from 22 patients were exposed for 24 hr to increas-ing GSI I concentrations, and apoptosis was evaluated byAnnexin V/PI staining. GSI I increased CLL cell apoptosis ina dose-dependent manner, with 0.1 mM which had a verymarginal effect, 1 mM which increased apoptosis but not in asignificant manner, and 2.5 and 5 mM which caused the high-est effects (Supporting Information Figs. S1a and S1b). GSI Iinduced apoptosis in CLL cells from all examined patients,regardless of clinical stage and biological characteristics.NOTCH1 mutational status of CLL samples does not seemto affect the susceptibility of CLL cells to GSI I-induced apo-ptosis. Indeed, the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutation(c.7544_7545delCT) previously identified in CLL,30 occurredin 2 of the 22 examined patients (3 and 14), and in thesetwo samples, reduction of cell viability by GSI I was similarin extent to that observed in unmutated samples (SupportingInformation Table 2).We then determined the time-course of GSI I-inducedapoptosis. In these and several of the next time-course experi-ments, CLL cells from 12 samples (1\u201312), including patientswith different characteristics, were exposed to 2.5 mM GSI Ifor 1, 4, 8 and 24 hr. GSI I, after 1 hr, had a marginal effect onCLL cell apoptosis, which began to increase after 4 hr and pro-gressively increased up to 24 hr (Figs. 1a and 1b).GSI I increases CLL cell apoptosis in the presence of bonemarrow stromal supportSince bone marrow microenvironment provides survivaladvantage and confers chemoresistance to CLL cells,32 weinvestigated whether GSI I is able to induce CLL cell apopto-sis in the presence of OP9 bone marrow stromal cells. Wecocultured CLL cells for 36 hr with OP9 cells with or withoutGSI I, and evaluated CLL cell viability and apoptosis byAnnexin V/PI staining. We performed these experiments inCLL cells from six samples (2\u20137), selected to include patientswith different characteristics. Results show that GSI I, at both2.5 and 5 mM, decreased CLL cell viability also in the pres-ence of OP9 cells, although they triggered pro-survival signalsto CLL cells (Fig. 1c). To exclude that GSI I overcomes thepro-survival effect of OP9 cells on CLL cells because of adirect toxicity on stromal support, we examined the effect ofGSI I on OP9 cell viability using MTS assay. Results showthat OP9 cell viability was not affected by GSI I, either at 2.5or 5 mM (Fig. 1d).GSI I rapidly inhibits proteasome activity in CLL cellsTo investigate whether GSI I inhibits proteasome activity inCLL cells, we analyzed (patients 1\u201312) the accumulation ofpolyubiquitinated proteins, which is an indicator of protea-some inhibition and a cause of proteasome inhibitor-inducedapoptosis.33 Time-course analysis shows that GSI I, alreadyafter 1 hr, induced, compared with controls, a strong accu-mulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, which furtherincreased at 4 and 8 hr and to a lesser degree at 24 hr(Fig. 2a). These results show that GSI I rapidly inhibits pro-teasome activity in CLL cells, and suggest that proteasomeinhibition may be one of the initial triggering events for GSII-induced CLL cell apoptosis.GSI I rapidly increases apoptotic ER stress signalingin CLL cellsBased on our recent findings that ex vivo CLL cells have afunctional ER stress-triggered caspase cascade initiated bycaspase-4 and involving caspase-8 and -3,24 we first investi-gated whether GSI I potentiates the activation of these cas-pases (patients 1\u201312). Time-course analysis shows that thecleavage of caspase-4 into its active 20-kDa subunit wasincreased by GSI I, compared with controls, already after 1hr and continued to be increased until 24 hr (Fig. 2b). GSI Ialso enhanced caspase-8 and -3 activation and PARP degra-dation, with effects evident from 4 hr onward (Fig. 2b). Toexamine the role of caspase-4 and the overall contribution ofcaspases to GSI I-induced apoptosis, we examined the effectof the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk and the pan-caspaseinhibitor z-VAD-fmk on the viability and apoptosis of CLLcells treated with GSI I (patients 2\u20137). Results show that thedecrease of cell viability induced by GSI I compared withcontrols, was partially prevented by z-LEVD-fmk and com-pletely prevented by z-VAD-fmk (Supporting InformationFig. S2a). Caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk also reduced theGSI I-induced processing of caspase-8 and -3 to their active18- and 17-kDa subunits, respectively (Supporting Informa-tion Fig. S2b), suggesting that GSI I-induced caspase-4 activa-tion acts upstream of caspase-8 and -3.CancerTherapyRosati et al. 1943Int. J. Cancer: 132, 1940\u20131953 (2013) VC 2012 UICCWe next examined the effect of GSI I on other proapop-totic events associated with ER stress, including the expres-sion of the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153,34 thecleavage of the ER membrane protein Bap31 into the proa-poptotic ER membrane-embedded fragment Bap20, eventknown to be induced by caspase-8 and important in propa-gating apoptotic signals from ER to mitochondria,35 and thephosphorylation of JNK1/2, a kinase activated by the IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 branch of the ER stress response,36 andinvolved in connecting ER to mitochondria37 (patients 1\u201312).Results show that CHOP/GADD153 levels, which in controlsincreased from 1 hr onward, were not further increased byGSI I, whereas Bap31 cleavage into Bap20, which also pro-gressively increased in controls, was further enhanced by GSII, with evident effects observed at 8 and 24 hr (Fig. 2c).JNK1/2 phosphorylation was also enhanced by GSI I from 1up to 8 hr and decreased at 24 hr, however, remaining higherthan in controls, where it had almost completely decreased(Fig. 2c). IRE1a expression, which in controls, increased from1 hr onward, was further enhanced by GSI I after 1 and 4 hrand decreased at later time-points (Fig. 2c). Altogether, theseresults show that GSI I increases CLL cell apoptosis activat-ing several pathways associated with ER stress.GSI I increases the activation of the mitochondrialapoptotic pathway in CLL cellsTo determine whether mitochondrial alterations are involvedin GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, we examined, in CLLFigure 1.

In all examined samples,the cytosolic levels of all three proteins began to increase at 4hr following treatment compared with controls, and progres-sively increased up to 24 hr. A concomitant reduction inmitochondrial levels of all three proteins, compared withcontrols, began to appear after 8 hr of treatment, and wasmore pronounced at 24 hr (Fig. 3a). Proteolytic activation ofcaspase-9, known to initiate the cytochrome c-dependent cas-pase cascade, also began to increase after 4 hr of treatmentcompared with controls, continued to increase at 8 hr andreturned to control values at 24 hr (Fig. 3b). Altogether, theseresults show that GSI I increases the mitochondrial pathwayactivation, and that this event occurs after proteasome inhibi-tion and ER stress induction.Figure 3.

J. Cancer: 132, 1940\u20131953 (2013) VC 2012 UICCJNK1/2 signaling activated by GSI I is involved inconverging ER stress apoptotic signals to the mitochondria.It is known that JNK1/2 activation connects ER stress with mi-tochondrial apoptosis by several mechanisms.37 To determinewhether the increased JNK1/2 phosphorylation induced byGSI I contributes to mitochondrial alterations, we analyzed theeffect of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on cytochrome c andSmac/DIABLO release to the cytosol, induced by GSI I in CLLcells (patients 2\u20137). In all examined samples, SP600125 com-pletely abrogated the increase in JNK1/2 phosphorylationinduced by GSI I (Fig. 3c) and partially prevented the cytosolicaccumulation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 3d), aswell as the decrease of CLL cell viability induced by GSI I(Fig. 3e). These results suggest that JNK1/2 activation by GSI Icontributes, at least in part, to CLL cell apoptosis by converg-ing ER stress apoptotic signals to the mitochondria.GSI I-induced apoptosis of CLL cells is associated withNoxa up-regulation and occurs notwithstanding Mcl-1accumulationHaving shown that, in CLL cells, GSI I activates the mitochon-drial apoptotic pathway, and given the crucial role of Bcl-2 fam-ily members in controlling mitochondrial apoptosis,38 we inves-tigated the effect of GSI I on some of these molecules (patients1\u201312). Analysis of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1,critical mediators of CLL cell survival,39 showed that whereasBcl-2 expression remained unchanged after GSI I treatment,Mcl-1 levels were rapidly increased, compared with controls, al-ready after 1 hr. Mcl-1 levels were maintained high by GSI I upto 24 hr, time at which, in control cells, they were reduced (Fig.4a). We next examined the proapoptotic proteins Bax, knownto directly affect the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabil-ity to apoptogenic factors, and the BH3-only proteins Noxa andBim, which function, the former, by neutralizing the antiapop-totic Mcl-1 and Bfl/A1 thereby releasing Bax and Bak, and thelatter, by directly inducing Bax oligomerization.38 Analysis ofcytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions revealed thatGSI I, from 4 hr onward, induced a time-dependent reductionof cytosolic Bax levels accompanied by an increase in the mito-chondrial levels (Fig. 4b). Analysis of Noxa and Bim proteinsshowed that Noxa levels were strongly up-regulated, as early as1 hr following treatment, and continued to increase with time(Figs. 4c left panel and 4d), whereas Bim EL, L and S isoformlevels remained unchanged after GSI I treatment (Fig. 4c rightpanel). This high Noxa expression suggests that it is a criticaleffector in GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis and prompted usto examine whether Noxa increase was due to transcriptionalup-regulation (patients 2-7). GSI I induced, already after 1 hr, aweak increase in Noxa mRNA levels which progressivelyincreased with time, exceeding, after 24 hr, a ninefold increasecompared with untreated cells (Fig. 4e). Therefore, GSI I, espe-cially in the late phases of apoptosis, up-regulates Noxa proteinby increasing its transcription. Noxa up-regulation by GSI Ialso depends on protein synthesis, given that treating CLL cellswith GSI I in the presence of the translation inhibitor CHX(patients 2\u20137) strongly prevented GSI I-induced Noxa increase(Fig. 4f). These results along with the evidence that CHX pre-vented the decrease of CLL cell viability induced by GSI I (Fig.4g) suggest that GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis requires thesynthesis of proapoptotic protein(s), including Noxa.Next, in an attempt to discover the mechanisms impli-cated in Noxa up-regulation by GSI I, we investigated thepossible involvement of JNK1/2 signaling. Noxa proteinexpression was analyzed in CLL cells pretreated with the JNKinhibitor SP600125 and then exposed to GSI I (patients 2\u20137).In all examined samples, inhibition of JNK1/2 phosphoryla-tion induced by SP600125 (Fig. 4h left panel) resulted indecreased Noxa expression (Fig. 4h right panel), and suggeststhat JNK signaling contributes, at least in part, to Noxaprotein up-regulation by GSI I, thus further contributing tomitochondrial pathway activation.Silencing of Mcl-1 enhances apoptotic activityof GSI I in CLL cellsHaving shown that GSI I rapidly induced accumulation ofMcl-1 protein, a critical factor for CLL cell survival andchemoresistance,40 we investigated whether Mcl-1 accumula-tion affects proapoptotic activity of GSI I. Therefore, we exam-ined the effect of Mcl-1 down-regulation by siRNA on GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis. CLL cells were transfected withcontrol nontargeting (siCtrl) or Mcl-1 siRNA (siMcl-1), and24 hr after transfection were exposed for 4 hr to 2.5 mM GSI Ior DMSO. We performed these experiments in CLL cells fromfive samples, including patients with different characteristics(2, 13\u201316). Western blot analysis performed after transfectionshowed that, in siMcl-1 CLL cells of the different patients,there was a significant reduction of Mcl-1 (Fig. 5a) which,consistent with previous studies,41 resulted in decreased CLLcell viability, as indicated by increased PARP degradation (Fig.5a) and reduced percentage of viable Annexin V\ufffd/PI\ufffd cells(Fig. 5b). When transfected CLL cells were exposed to GSI I orDMSO, we found that in siCtrl cells treated with GSI I, therewas a substantial accumulation of Mcl-1 which reached highexpression levels, whereas in siMcl-1 cells, Mcl-1 levelsremained low in response to GSI I, even if in some patients,they increased compared with siMcl-1 cells in DMSO (Figs. 5cand 5d). Analysis of Annexin V/PI staining shows thatwhereas in siCtrl cells, GSI I decreased cell viability by only19.9 6 7.2% (p < 0.01) compared with DMSO, in siMcl-1CLL cells, GSI I decreased cell viability by 64.5 6 10.2% (p <0.01) (Figs. 5e and 5f). These data show that Mcl-1 down-reg-ulation enhances GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis suggestingthat Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I may slow down,but does not impede, mitochondrial pathway activation.Notch inhibition by GSI I contributes to amplifyCLL cell apoptosisDuring previous studies involving Notch in CLL cell survival,we found that GSI I, after 24 hr, increased CLL cell apoptosisCancerTherapyRosati et al. 1947Int.

In all samples, GSI I inhibitedthe generation of Notch1 and Notch2 intracellular domains(IC), as well as the expression of the precursors (P) and thetransmembrane/cytoplasmic portion (TM), only after 24 hr,whereas up to 8 hr, the levels of the three forms of bothreceptors appeared slightly increased or unchanged comparedwith controls (Fig. 6a). Hes1 expression was also reduced byGSI I after 24 hr, whereas up to 8 hr, Hes1 levels appearedstable (Fig. 6b). The evidence that GSI I inhibits Notch sig-naling at the time of maximum CLL cell apoptosis indicatesthat Notch inhibition is not critical for initiating apoptosis.However, this event contributes to amplify CLL cell apopto-sis, because Notch signaling has a pro-survival role in thesecells. This was demonstrated in genetic inhibition studies, inwhich Notch1 and Notch2 were down-regulated by siRNA(patients 2, 18\u201322). Results show that siRNA down-regulationof both Notch1, as demonstrated for the first time here (Figs.6c and 6d), and Notch2, as previously reported9 and shownFigure 5.

Cancer: 132, 1940\u20131953 (2013) VC 2012 UICCin Supporting Information Figures S3a and S3b, increasedCLL cell apoptosis compared with siCtrl treatment.DiscussionThe major finding of our study is that GSI I triggers apopto-sis of primary CLL cells by inhibiting proteasome activityand enhancing ER stress signaling and amplifies it by block-ing Notch activation. This is the first evidence that in CLL,GSI I simultaneously targets three key apoptosis regulators toinduce apoptosis, even if the dual activities of GSI I on pro-teasome and Notch has also been demonstrated in other tu-mor cells.16\u201318 These findings may have important therapeu-tic implications for CLL, considering the emerging interest ingenerating new anticancer multitarget agents, based on thecurrent opinion that anticancer drugs, able to interfere simul-taneously with multiple altered pathways, might be moreeffective than highly selective drugs.4,5Our results show that GSI I increases CLL cell apoptosisalso in the presence of pro-survival signals triggered by OP9stromal cells, suggesting the potential to reverse cytoprotec-tion by the microenvironment.We demonstrate that proteasome inhibition by GSI Ioccurs concomitant with an increased activation of some ERstress-associated apoptotic pathways and a strong up-regula-tion of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. In CLLcells, GSI I rapidly potentiates a specific ER stress-triggeredcaspase cascade, initiated by caspase-4 and involving caspase-8 and -3, which is already functional in ex vivo CLL cells andplays an important role in their spontaneous apoptosis.24 GSII also rapidly increases JNK1/2 phosphorylation and theexpression of IRE1a, an ER membrane kinase known to acti-vate the ASK1/JNK pathway of the ER stress response.36 Thecleavage of the ER stress regulator Bap31 into the proapoptotic Bap20 fragment is also increased by GSI I, furtherconfirming the involvement of ER stress in GSI I-inducedCLL cell apoptosis.Time-course studies indicate that proteasome inhibitionand all ER stress apoptotic events induced by GSI I in CLLcells precede, and some of them contribute to, the activationof the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, characterized by Baxtranslocation to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c,Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 to the cytosol, and caspase-9activation. In this context, pharmacologic inhibition studiesshow that JNK1/2 activation induced by GSI I contributes, atleast in part, to the mitochondrial release of cytochrome cand Smac/DIABLO to the cytosol, suggesting its involvementin converging ER stress signals to mitochondria.Mitochondrial integrity is tightly regulated by a wise bal-ance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of theBcl-2 family.38 In CLL cells, GSI I increases mitochondrialalterations without down-regulating Bcl-2 expression, and inthe presence of a rapid accumulation of the short-lived pro-tein Mcl-1, which can be due either to an inhibited proteaso-mal degradation42 or an adaptive response to ER stress, asalso observed in other tumor cells.43 However, the evidencethat restraining Mcl-1 accumulation by siRNA increases GSII-induced CLL cell apoptosis, along with the evidence thatGSI I induces mitochondrial perturbations, suggests thatMcl-1 persistence induced by GSI I slows down, but does notimpede them. This is probably due to the fact that Mcl-1could be sequestered by Noxa so allowing Bax and/or Bak topermeabilize mitochondria, as reported elsewhere.44,45 Con-sistent with this observation, we show that, in CLL cells, GSII rapidly induces a strong Noxa protein up-regulation whichprecedes Bax translocation to mitochondria, thus suggestingthat Noxa plays a critical role in GSI I-induced CLL cell apo-ptosis. We show that Noxa increase depends on new proteinsynthesis and, especially in the late apoptotic phases, on tran-scriptional up-regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition studiessuggest that a contribution to up-regulating Noxa protein lev-els is made by the increased JNK1/2 activation induced byGSI I. However, Noxa up-regulation by GSI I may alsodepend on protein stabilization as a consequence of protea-some inhibition, as occurs in CLL cells treated with the pro-teasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132.46 Since Noxa is atarget of p5347 and p53 is regulated by the proteasome,48 thepossibility that GSI I increases Noxa mRNA by increasingcellular pools of p53 cannot be excluded.Another observation of our study is that GSI I inhibitsNotch signaling when CLL cell apoptosis has reached themaximum level, whereas in the early apoptotic phases, CLLcells show an accumulation of Notch1 and Notch2 proteinsand a stabilization of Hes1 levels. This is probably due toproteasome inhibition because various Notch pathway com-ponents have a fast turnover rate and are tightly regulated bythe ubiquitin/proteasome system.49 The evidence that GSI Iinhibits Notch signaling in the late apoptotic phases suggeststhat Notch inhibition is not crucial in initiating CLL cell apo-ptosis and therefore, that the key events induced by GSI I totrigger CLL cell apoptosis are the proteasome inhibition andthe increase in ER stress. Notch inhibition by GSI I contrib-utes to amplify CLL cell apoptosis because Notch signalinghas a pro-survival role in these cells, as demonstrated by theevidence that silencing either Notch1 or Notch2 acceleratesspontaneous CLL cell apoptosis.The extent to which the inhibition of Notch and protea-some by GSI I contributes to apoptosis has also been inves-tigated in other malignancies. In breast cancer cell lines17and in glioblastoma tumor cells,18 the main target of GSI Iis the proteasome. In precursor-B ALL cells, GSI I inducesapoptosis by inhibiting Notch signaling and through Notch-independent mechanisms including, besides proteasome inhi-bition, the increase of reactive oxygen species productionand the disruption of the AKT pro-survival pathway.19 Theability of GSI I to target Notch, AKT and other pro-survivalpathways, has also been shown in cutaneous T-cell lym-phoma.50 All these findings have led to an in-depth under-standing of the mechanisms of action of GSI I in tumorcells which is essential to define the potential clinical use ofGSI I.CancerTherapyRosati et al. 1951Int.
