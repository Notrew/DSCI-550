While the biologicalfunction of maspin in blocking tumor invasion and metastasis is consistent with the loss of maspin expression at the latestage of tumor progression, the differential expression and the biological significance of maspin in early stage of tumorprogression appear to be complex and remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we examined the expression of maspinin 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases (stages I\u2013III) and 55 non-tumor adjacent esophageal tissuespecimens by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation of maspin with clinicopathological parameters wasanalyzed. Compared to normal esophageal squamous tissue where 80% (47/55) of the cases expressed maspin at a low tomoderate level, all ESCC specimens (100% (84/84)) were positive for maspin expression at a moderate to high level. ESCCwith low or moderate maspin expression had significantly shorter postoperative survival rates compared to those that hadhigh maspin expression (p,0.001). Since the correlation of maspin with ESCC histology and the correlation of maspin withESCC prognosis seem to be at odds, we further investigated the biological function of maspin in ESCC using the establishedESCC cell lines. The expression of maspin in five human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines (T12, E450, KYSE150, EC109,and KYSE510) was examined by the Western blot. ESCC cell line KYSE510 that did not express maspin and was stablytransfected by maspin cDNA or an empty vector. The resulting transfected cells were characterized in vitro. Maspinexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility and matrigel invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that thetransient up-regulation of maspin in the early development of ESCC may be a defense mechanism against further transitiontowards more malignant phenotypes, ultimately slowing down ESCC tumor progression.Citation: Wang Y, Sheng S, Zhang J, Dzinic S, Li S, et al.

The two main subtypes ofesophageal carcinoma are adenocarcinoma and squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC), while the most commonly diagnosed esoph-ageal cancer in China and other Asian countries is ESCC [3,4].Despite the rapid advancement in combined chemotherapy andradiation therapy for ESCC, the average 5-year overall survivalhas remained steady at 10\u201320% [2,5,6]. Unfortunately, theprediction of clinical prognosis of patients with ESCC based onconventional pathological variables, such as the tumor size, tumorgrade, and the tumor stage is highly empirical [7\u20139]. Specificbiomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the progression ofESCC may significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction ofpatients\u2019 survival. To this end, it is important to note that many ofthe molecular markers that are associated with specific patholog-ical grades (diagnosis) have failed to serve as prognostic markers. Itis well appreciated that tumor progression is a continuum ofdynamic molecular and cellular changes. The link of a molecularprofile with a phenotype may not reflect whether the former isdriver or a passenger of the latter, and may not predict whetherthis association is consequential for further tumor progression.Some molecular changes may be suppressive steps that mayeventually give way to the predominant oncogenic changes. Thecapacity of tumor cells to turn on tumor suppressive mechanisms,even though transitory, may translate into delayed tumorprogression, and prolonged patients\u2019 survival.Maspin is an epithelial-specific tumor suppressor that isdifferentially regulated during tumor progression. It is a memberof the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [10] but withfunctions that are deviant from those of classical serine protease-inhibiting serpins. Accumulated evidence suggests that maspinmay play a key role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasisby blocking serine protease-like enzymes such as the zymogenform of urokinase-type plasminogen activator [11,12] and histonePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581deacetylase 1 [13]. Consistent with its anti-invasion and anti-metastasis properties, maspin expression is found to be downregulated in the progression of many types of cancer at the step oftumor invasion and metastasis.As a tumor suppressor, maspin is not immediately down-regulated in the early development of cancer. In fact, accumulatedevidence demonstrates a transient up-regulation of maspin in non-invasive cancer of breast [14,15], ovary [16], and pancreas[17,18]. In adenocarcinomas, this up-regulation of maspin is alsoassociated with its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.In squamous cell carcinomas, however, maspin is alwaysdistributed to both nucleus and cytoplasm. The biologicalsignificance of these distinct differential patterns is a subject ofcurrent investigation. Based on our earlier studies, the transloca-tion of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in early stageadenocarcinoma correlates with significantly better survival oflung cancer [19]. On the other hand, elevated maspin expressionin early stage squamous cell carcinoma both, nuclear andcytosolic, correlates with significantly better survival of oralsquamous cell carcinoma [20]. These data suggest that theprognosis of cancer subtypes may be distinctly stratified based onmaspin differential expression.In this paper, we report the first clinical evidence that maspinwas significantly elevated in a subpopulation of stage I-III ESCCspecimens. The level of maspin expression correlated with betteroverall survival of ESCC patients. We further investigated thebiological function of maspin using established ESCC cell linesand showed an inhibitory effect of maspin on cell proliferation,motility, and invasion. These data suggest that ESCC with anability to up-regulate maspin may be protected against furthermalignant progression.Materials and MethodsTissue SpecimensThis research involves 84 archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human stage I\u2013III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC) tissue specimens, from patients who were eligible for andunderwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007 at theDepartment of Surgery, Beijing Cancer Hospital (China). Inaddition, tumor-adjacent normal tissue specimens were collectedfrom 55 of these patients. Prior to the tissue collection, the clinicalprotocol was approved by the ethics review board of PekingUniversity Health Sciences Center. Informed written consentswere obtained from the patients. The consents were saved asscanned PDF files, and saved in patients\u2019 records. The sampleswere de-identified to the research group. The 84 patients included64 men and 20 women with a median age of 58 years (rangingfrom 43 to 73 years).Immunohistochemical (IHC) StainingTissue sections on slides of 5 mm thickness were subjected tohematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and IHC staining ofmaspin as described previously [16]. Monoclonal antibody againstmaspin (clone G167\u201370; Pharmingen/BD Bioscience, San Diego,CA) was diluted 100-fold. The horse-reddish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Cambridge-shire, UK) was detected by chromogenic reaction of HRP. Fornegative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. The tissuesections were examined and scored independently by the twopathologists who had no prior knowledge of the study aim ordesign. Maspin expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated bythe percentage of maspin positive cells and the intensity of maspinstaining on the scale of 0\u20133. The percentage of positive cells wascategorically scored as following: 0 points (maspin positive in 0\u20135% of cells); 2 points (maspin positive in 6\u201350% of cells); 3 points(maspin positive in .50% of cells). The staining intensity wascategorically scored as follows: 1 point: negative or weak staining;2 points: moderate staining; 3 points: strong staining. The overallmaspin expression (OMS) was calculated as the sum of thepercentage category points and the intensity category points ineach case. Tumors were categorized into four groups: negative:#5% of cells stained, regardless of intensity; weak expression(OMS: 0\u20132 points); moderate expression (OMS: 3\u20134 points); andstrong expression (OMS: 5\u20136 points). Maspin sub-cellular patternof nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were assessed semi-quantitatively on the basis of the percentage of positive cells, asdescribed previously [21]. Maspin nuclear immunoreactivity wasdefined as stronger nuclear staining than cytoplasmic staining in atleast 10% of tumor cells. Maspin cytoplasmic immunoreactivitywas defined as stronger cytoplasmic staining than nuclear stainingin at least 10% of tumor cells.Cell Lines and Cell CultureFive human ESCC cell lines (KYSE-510, KYSE-150, T12,E450 and EC-109) were purchased from Institute of Basic MedicalSciences Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences\u2019 cell culture center(Beijing, China). The cells were maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, US) supplemented with 10%heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.Western BlottingCells were lysed with 16 RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute ofBiotechnology, Nantong, China) containing 25 mg/mL leupeptin(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/mL aprotinin(Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were removed from the dishes by cellscraping. The samples were then subjected to three cycles offreeze-thaw and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. Theprotein concentration of the samples was determined using abicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Reagent kit, and whole celllysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto apolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane wasblocked in 5% skim milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) andthen probed with primary antibodies against maspin (1:500diluted) and a-actin (from SIGMA, 1:10,000 diluted), respectively.The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at1:2,500 dilutions. The bound secondary antibody was detected bychemiluminescence reaction (Millipore, Bedford, USA) andvisualized by radiography.Stable TransfectionSequence-verified maspin cDNA cloned into a vector forexpression in mammalian cells [22] was used to transfectapproximately 60% confluent KYSE-510 using the Lipofectami-neTM2000 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The empty vector DNAwas used in parallel transfection as a negative control. For clonalselection, 24 hrs after transfection, G418 was added to the culturemedium at the concentration of 400 mg/mL. The cells weremaintained in G418-containing medium for the next 4 weeks untilindividual clones were selected. The selected clones weresubsequently maintained in the medium containing 200 mg/mLof G418.Cell Proliferation AssayTo determine the effect of maspin on cell proliferation, cellswith and without maspin were seeded into 96-well plate at aMaspin and ESCC PrognosisPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581density of 46103/well/200 mL in the maintenance medium.Viable cells were quantified at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h) afterthe seeding by the chromogenic 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay according to themanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Sigma, St. Louis, US). Each assaywas performed in triplicates and repeated 3 times.Colony Formation AssayCells seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well/medium volume, were allowed to grow for 10 days to formcolonies. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and treated withGiemsa for 10 min, and then photographed with a digital camera(OLYMPUS, SP350). The number of colonies and the number ofcells in each colony was counted under the microscopy. Thecolonies which had more than 100 cells were defined as bigcolonies.Wound-healing AssayThe cells were added to six-well plates, allowed to formconfluent monolayers and were serum starved overnight. Anartificial wound was created in the cell monolayer with a sterileplastic 200 mL micropipette tip to generate one homogeneouswound in each well. After wounding, the culture medium wasremoved, and cells were washed at least twice to eliminatedetached cells. Wound closure was photographed at 0, 6, 12, and24 h after wounding. Images of cells from the same field wereacquired at the indicated time points, using an invertedmicroscope equipped with a digital camera. The number of cellsin each colony was counted under microscope. Each measurementwas performed in triplicate.Matrigel Invasion AssayInvasion assay was performed using 8 mm PET pore sizemembrane coated with Matrigel (24-well, BD Biosciences, Bed-ford, MA). Cells were seeded at 26105 cells per 500 mL of growthmedium on the Matrigel-coated membrane. The bottom wellswere filled with the maintenance culture medium, and thechambers were incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2. After24 h, the Matrigel and non-invading cells in the upper chamberwere removed by scraping. The cells on the bottom side of themembrane (invading cells) were stained with 1% crystal violet andcounted under the microscope. Each experiment was performed intriplicate.Statistical AnalysisClinicopathological factors were analyzed separately using thechi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimatethe patient survival and the log-rank test was used to determine thestatistical significance. The associations between discrete variableswere assessed using the chi-square test. All data were expressed asthe mean 6 standard deviation. A p-value of less than 0.05 wasconsidered to be statistically significant. Statistical calculationswere performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciencessoftware version 11.0 (SPSS11.0).ResultsDifferential Maspin Expression in Human ESCC andNormal Adjacent TissuesTo investigate whether the level or subcellular localization ofmaspin helps predict the survival of ESCC patients, ESCC tissueswere collected from 84 stage I-III patients who were eligible forand underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007. Thesepatients were followed up for at least 5 years. IHC was performedto examine the expression of maspin in these tumor specimens, aswell as 55 tumor-adjacent normal tissues, and the level of maspinexpression was semi-quantified using the method described in theMaterials and Methods section. Representative results are shownin Figure 1. As summarized in Table 1, among 55 cases ofnormal esophageal tissues, the positive immunoreactivity wasassociated with 85% of cases (47/55). The 8 patients had nomaspin immunoreactivity, 37 cases had weak maspin staining, and10 cases were associated with strong maspin staining. In contrast,all 84 ESCC specimens showed positive maspin staining. 33 tumorspecimens were associated with weak maspin staining, whereas 51cases had strong maspin staining. Overall, as compared to thecorresponding normal esophageal tissues, ESCC tissues exhibitedstronger maspin IHC signals and a higher percentage of maspin-strong cells (p,0.001).Based on the overall maspin expression, all the tumor specimenscan be divided by the total level of maspin expression (low/moderate vs. strong), the level of nuclear maspin (weak/moderatevs. strong), and the level of cytoplasmic maspin (weak/moderatevs. strong). The stratification of these different groups withclinicopatholoigcal variables was evaluated. As summarized inTable 2, there was no significant difference between the groupswith respect to sex, age, pathologic grade and tumor stage. Inaddition, we also analyzed the association between subcellularlocalization of maspin and clinicopathological variables. Eventhough not statistically significant, we observed the followingtrends: poorly differentiated tumors were associated with weakernuclear maspin staining and stronger cytoplasmic maspin staining.In addition, the lymph node metastasis was associated with ahigher level of cytoplasmic maspin staining as compared to lymphnode negative patients.Maspin Expression Correlates with Better OverallPostoperative SurvivalOur cohort of ESCC patients were followed up for at least 5years, as of March 2012, with a median survival of 36.5 months. Inorder to test if maspin expression is associated with increased ordecreased patient survival, patients were classified into two groups,those with strong maspin expression (51 cases, OMS 5\u20136) or thosewith weak and moderate maspin expression (33 cases, OMS 2\u20134).The corresponding median survival time for these two groups were45611.1 months and 1962.9 months, respectively, demonstratingthat stronger maspin expression is associated with significantlyincreased patient survival and favorable prognosis. (Figure 2A,log-rank, p = 0.009). Since previous reports in breast [23] and lungcancer [19] for example, suggest that nuclear maspin is associatedwith better overall patient survival, we also investigated whethermaspin subcellular localization correlated with the overall survival.For this purpose, the patients were classified into two correspond-ing groups: predominantly nuclear expression or predominantlycytoplasmic expression patients. Although the p value did notreach a significant difference, stronger expression of maspin in thenucleus was still associated with a more favorable patient prognosis(4469.5 months vs. 2164.5 months; p = 0.051) (Figures 2B and2C). In general, maspin expression level correlated with less tumorlocal invasion. We also observed a trend for the negativecorrelation between maspin expression and lymph node metastasis(Table 2). In addition, reduced nuclear maspin and increasedcytoplasmic maspin were associated with lymph node metastasis.Although these data did not reach statistical significance, in partlimited by the number of patients, they are consistent with thenotion that the mortality of these ESCC patients result primarilyfrom metastasis.Maspin and ESCC PrognosisPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581Maspin Expressed in ESCC Cell Lines is TumorSuppressiveEstablished ESCC cell lines offer a valuable experimental modelto study the progression and underlying molecular mechanisms.Similar to the observation with early stage ESCC specimens, thelevel of maspin was not significantly altered in ESCC cell lines thatare only weakly or moderately aggressive (T12, E450, KYSE150,and EC109) [24], as judged by Western blotting (Figure 3A).However, ESCC cell line KYSE510 that was significantly moreinvasive and grew at a faster rate had lost maspin expression(Figure 3B).To investigate the functional significance of maspin in ESCC,we took the advantage of KYSE510 cell line that did not expressmaspin and stably transfected the cells with maspin-encodingpCMV-Tag2-maspin vector or an empty vector pCMV-Tag2.The maspin expression in the resulting maspin transfected cells(M-KYSE510) and the mock transfected control (V-KYSE510) areshown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4B, maspin expressioncorrelated with decreased cell proliferation as judged by the MTTassay. Earlier, it was reported that maspin regulated cellattachment and detachment [13,25]. To determine whether theeffect of maspin expression on tumor growth was a result of alteredcolonization, cells were suspended and seeded at a low density incell culture dish. The number of the single cell-derived coloniesand number of cells per colony were evaluated under themicroscope. Maspin expression did not significantly alter thecolony forming ability, for the colony numbers for M-KYSE510,V-KYSE510 and the parental cells were not significantly different(data not shown). However, as shown in Figure 4C, the size of M-KYSE510 colonies was significantly smaller compared to thosederived fromV-KYSE510 cell line. Consistently, the number ofcells per colony was significantly lower than those for V-KYSE510and parental cells. The number of colonies of M-KYSE510 withmore than 100 cells was approximately a half of those of V-KYSE510 or parental KYSE510cells (p,0.01, Figure 4D).To further investigate whether the presence of maspin in ESCCis a gain or loss of other functions in tumor progression, weexamined the effect of maspin expression on tumor cell motilityand invasion. As shown by the in vitro wound healing assay(Figure 5A), The M-KYSE-510 displayed a significantly attenu-ated rate of wound healing as compared to V-KYSE-510 orparental KYSE-510 cells. Moreover, as compared to V-KYSE-510 or parental KYSE-510 cells, M-KYSE-510 exhibited asignificantly lower capacity to migrate through the Matrigel-coated transwell membrane in the in vitro invasion assay (p,0.01,Figures 5B and 5C).Although the level of maspin correlated with the overallsurvival, the biological function and underlying molecularmechanisms of maspin may not be as simple. The effects ofmaspin may further depend on tumor microenvironments. Inaddition to reducing the proliferative activity and invasivepotential, maspin may also prevent tumor angiogenesis throughepigenetic regulation [26\u201330].Earlier we have shown that maspin may directly inhibit cellsurface-associated uPA to block tumor cell detachment[12,26,31,32]. Data from the Hendrix Laboratory [33] and ourlaboratory [29] further suggest that maspin may down-regulate theexpression of uPA. To test whether the effect of maspin on theFigure 1.

Consideringthe differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocar-cinoma, the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effects ofmaspin on ESCC invasion may not be identical to that incarcinoma cells of breast and prostate origin. To date, there is noclinical consensus about uPA as a prognostic marker for ESCC.DiscussionThe challenge for clinicians and oncologists in terms of patientpersonalized medicine and plan for treatment is that early stagetumors with similar histopathological features may subsequentlydisplay dramatically different outcome. In this paper, we describedthe first evidence that tumor suppressor maspin expression in earlystage ESCC positively correlated with overall postoperativesurvival of patients. In light of our in vitro data that maspininhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor invasion, severalimportant observations with human specimens suggest a uniquevalue of maspin as a molecular prognostic marker of ESCC.Overall, our data support a hypothetical model (Figure 6) thathelps explain the correlation between maspin up-regulation andbetter overall survival of patients with ESCC. Based on this model,maspin is expressed in early stage ESCC to retain the epithelialhomeostasis. In the absence of oncogenic changes, a basal level ofmaspin expression is maintained in normal or benign squamousepithelial cells to counter incidental stress and transformationinsults. Upon the transformation and other oncogenic changes, thebasal level of maspin expression may not be sufficient to counter-balance the biological effects of oncogenes. Those epithelial cellsthat are still capable of up-regulating maspin expression willremain better differentiated with low potential to invade andmetastasize. The balance will shift towards more malignantphenotypes in those cells that are not capable of up-regulatingmaspin or would eventually lose maspin expression. In contrast tomolecular markers whose differential expression patterns com-pletely coincide with histopathological features, early stage ESCCcells expressing maspin at different levels may be histologicallyTable 2.

The usefulness of maspin differential expression may notbe to confirm pathological diagnosis. Rather, maspin may beuniquely useful as an independent marker to predict the course ofthe disease progression.Maspin is an epithelial-specific protein. We did not detectspecific maspin antigen by immunohistochemistry in stromalcomponents in human ESCC specimens. Clinical studies tocorrelate maspin and tumor progression have been mostlyconducted with adenocarcinoma, which is thought to be ofglandular epithelial origin. Together with our current study, thereare only two reports on how maspin expression correlates with theprogression of squamous cell carcinoma, which derives fromstratified squamous epithelial cells. The reported data with oralsquamous cell carcinoma [20,34] share the following importantsimilarities with our current study with ESCC: (i) both studies wereconducted with surgically resected early stage tumor specimens; (ii)in both cases, maspin protein was detected in almost all tumorcells, and was overexpressed in some tumor cells; (iii) maspinprotein was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; and (iv)the overall maspin expression levels correlated with better survivalof the patients. In comparison, a distinct maspin differentialexpression patter is observed in adenocarcinoma. Studies withtissue specimens from breast [35,36], prostate [37], and lung [19]adenocarcinoma showed that maspin is predominantly a nuclearprotein in benign epithelial cells. Pre-neoplastic lesions and earlystage carcinomas are commonly associated with elevated level ofmaspin, which is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm [19,35].In invasive and metastatic carcinoma maspin expression is down-regulated or lost [38\u201340]. To our knowledge, maspin is the onlymolecular marker that displays distinct differential expressionpatterns in the progression of different subtypes of carcinoma.Figure 3.

Thus, tumor suppressor genes that are mecha-nistically involved in tumor progression may be more insightfulmolecular markers for diagnosis or prediction of prognosis. Aparadigm based on the studies of classic tumor suppressor geneswhose loss or mutation at the genetic level contributes tocarcinogenesis and tumor progression would predict that tumorsuppressors would be down-regulated as long as the oncogenesis isinitiated [42]. Therefore, the tumor suppressive functions ofmaspin may seem to be at odds with the observation that maspin isactually transiently up-regulated in some cells that have alreadyacquired the histopathologic features of tumor cells. To this end, itis important to point out that maspin is primarily regulated at thelevel of expression and trafficking. Although maspin is not asfrequently mutated as some other well-known tumor suppressorgenes such as p53 [43], a specific Ser176RPro polymorphism hasbeen identified [44] which seems to be frequent in gastric cancerand had reduced tumor suppressive potency as compared to thewild type maspin.In vitro data from this study are in line with the consensus thatmaspin exerts multifaceted anti-tumor effects, inhibiting tumorgrowth, motility, invasion, and sensitizing tumor cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Maspin may be a nuclear, cytoplasmic, cellmembrane-associated, as well as secreted molecule. The multifac-eted biological activities of maspin may be coordinated by itsmolecular partnerships and subcellular localization [45\u201347]. Tothis end, the Sheng laboratory was the first to report that (i)secreted endogenous maspin binds and inhibits single-chain tissuetype plasminogen activator (sc-tPA, a zymogen) that is bound tofibrin or fibrinogen [48], (ii) extracellular maspin specifically bindsand inhibits pro-urokinase type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA, azymogen) that is associated with cell surface-anchored uPAreceptor (uPAR) [32] and (iii) intracellular maspin specificallyinteracts and inhibits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) [13]. Whilethe specific molecular mode of action of cytoplasmic maspin isunder investigation in our lab, and earlier report suggested thatcytoplasmic maspin regulates the Rho/Rac signaling network andblock tumor cell motility [49]. It is likely that endogenous targets ofmaspin may be molecular targets for cancer therapy.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: YW SS JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.Performed the experiments: YW JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.
