Schlesinger1*1 Center for Microbial Interface Biology, Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America,2 Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of AmericaAbstractComplement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) is a major macrophage phagocytic receptor. The biochemical pathwaysthrough which CR3 regulates immunologic responses have not been fully characterized. Francisella tularensis is a remarkablyinfectious, facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that causes tularemia. Early evasion of the host immuneresponse contributes to the virulence of F. tularensis and CR3 is an important receptor for its phagocytosis. Here we confirmthat efficient attachment and uptake of the highly virulent Type A F. tularensis spp. tularensis strain Schu S4 by humanmonocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) requires complement C3 opsonization and CR3. However, despite a.40-foldincrease in uptake following C3 opsonization, Schu S4 induces limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production comparedwith non-opsonized Schu S4 and the low virulent F. novicida. This suggests that engagement of CR3 by opsonized Schu S4contributes specifically to the immune suppression during and shortly following phagocytosis which we demonstrate byCD11b siRNA knockdown in hMDMs. This immune suppression is concomitant with early inhibition of ERK1/2, p38 MAPKand NF-kB activation. Furthermore, TLR2 siRNA knockdown shows that pro-inflammatory cytokine production and MAPKactivation in response to non-opsonized Schu S4 depends on TLR2 signaling providing evidence that CR3-TLR2 crosstalkmediates immune suppression for opsonized Schu S4. Deletion of the CD11b cytoplasmic tail reverses the CR3-mediateddecrease in ERK and p38 activation during opsonized Schu-S4 infection. The CR3-mediated signaling pathway involved inthis immune suppression includes Lyn kinase and Akt activation, and increased MKP-1, which limits TLR2-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. These data indicate that while the highly virulent F. tularensis uses CR3 for efficient uptake, optimalengagement of this receptor down-regulates TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory responses by inhibiting MAPK activationthrough outside-in signaling. CR3-linked immune suppression is an important mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of F.tularensis infection.Citation: Dai S, Rajaram MVS, Curry HM, Leander R, Schlesinger LS (2013) Fine Tuning Inflammation at the Front Door: Macrophage Complement Receptor 3-mediates Phagocytosis and Immune Suppression for Francisella tularensis.

F. novicida is normallyconsidered to be the fourth subspecies of F. tularensis; however,recent genome-wide polymorphism analysis indicates that it is anindependent species [5]. F. novicida rarely causes disease in humansbut is virulent in mice, manifesting a disease that is similar totularemia in humans, and has been widely used in the mousemodel of tularemia. Because F. tularensis can be easily disseminat-ed, results in a high mortality rate among untreated pulmonarycases, and has the potential to cause public panic, it is given thehighest priority classification by the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) as a Category A select agent and is apotential bioweapon [1].Macrophages are the first line of defense against invadingmicroorganisms. However, as is the case for many other intracel-lular pathogens, F. tularensis is able to avoid and/or suppressmacrophage host defense mechanisms to enable survival andintracellular replication following phagocytosis. F. tularensis infectsprimarily alveolar macrophages in pneumonic tularemia [6].Macrophages combat F. tularensis infection by generating TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b[7\u201312]. However, this cytokine response is largely muted at the earlystage of F. tularensis infection. In fact, several studies have indicatedthat F. tularensis infection leads to broad immune suppression inPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114infected cells [13\u201316]. Compared with the low virulent F. novicida,infection of human phagocytes with the highly virulent Type A F.tularensis subsp. tularensis strain Schu S4 leads to significantly reducedpro-inflammatory cytokine production [17,18]. This immunesuppression is believed to be critical for the success of F. tularensisas a human pathogen, allowing for its replication and disseminationwithin the host early on. However, the molecular mechanismsinvolved in the early F. tularensis-induced immune suppression arenot completely understood.Multiple receptors, such as complement receptors, Fcc recep-tors, mannose receptor, scavenger receptor and surface nucleolinhave all been implicated in F. tularensis phagocytosis [19\u201324].Complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface, andcomplement receptors, specifically complement receptor 3 (CR3)on the macrophage surface play important roles in the uptake ofthe highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis by humanmacrophages [20,21,25]. CR3 (CD11b/CD18, aMb2) belongs tothe b2-integrin family. Complement receptors, particularly CR3,have long been postulated to allow for safe passage for intracellularpathogens [26\u201328]. CR3\u2019s function is dependent on the activationof outside-in and inside-out two way signals [29]. There isincreasing evidence for signaling crosstalk between complementreceptors and TLRs [30\u201332]. For example, TLR2 is able to trans-activate CR3 through inside-out signaling including the activationof Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34]. b2-integrin signaling canalso negatively regulate TLR responses [32,35]. Specifically, CR3can inhibit TLR4 signaling by promoting the degradation ofMyD88 and TRIF [36]. In addition, engagement of CR3 has beenshown to down-regulate IL-12 production [37] and avoidinitiation of the oxidative burst in macrophages followingphagocytosis of apoptotic cells [38,39]. A few pathogens such asPorphyromonas gingivalis [33], Mycobacterium bovis BCG [34] andBacillus anthracis spores [40] can activate CR3 through inside-outsignaling via TLR2 to facilitate bacterial uptake. However, to thebest of our knowledge, nothing is known about how theengagement of CR3 by a pathogen (i.e. outside-in signaling) canmediate regulation of TLR signaling pathways.Here we hypothesized that the initial interaction of F. tularensiswith human macrophage receptors will greatly impact thegeneration of early signals and consequent biological responsesby the macrophage. We show that C3-opsonized virulent F.tularensis subsp. tularensis utilizes CR3 to gain access into hostmacrophages while at the same time inhibits TLR2-mediated hostimmune responses, resulting in a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 mode of entryfollowed by robust intracellular replication. We also report the keysignaling pathways involved. Thus, we provide the first evidencefor linkage between a key phagocytic receptor for F. tularensis andpost-phagocytic signaling events important in immunosuppression.The involvement of complement receptors in immune suppressionmay be an important mechanism for F. tularensis pathogenesis, andthe pathways involved are likely to be broadly applicable to otherintracellular pathogens that use CR3-mediated entry.ResultsSerum opsonization, specifically C3 deposition, is criticalfor F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 phagocytosis byhuman macrophagesSerum components, specifically complement C3, and CR3 playa major role in efficient macrophage uptake of F. tularensis LiveVaccine Strain (LVS) and a clinical isolation (RCI) of subsp.tularensis [21]. We first set out to confirm the role of C3 and C3receptors in Schu S4 phagocytosis by human monocyte-derivedmacrophages (hMDMs). We infected hMDMs with Schu S4 in thepresence or absence of serum, or in C3-depleted or C3-repletedserum. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of serum, Schu S4uptake by hMDMs was very limited. In contrast, in the presence ofserum, the uptake was significantly increased ,40 fold confirmingthat serum opsonization is critical for efficient phagocytosis ofSchu S4 by human macrophages. Moreover, when we used C3-depleted serum the uptake of Schu S4 was limited, equivalent tothat seen in the absence of serum. Repletion of C3-depleted serumwith C3 led to a significant increase in uptake akin to that seenfollowing serum opsonization. This result provides furtherevidence that serum components, especially C3 deposited onbacterial surface, are critical for efficient phagocytosis of Schu S4by human macrophages.C3 opsonization is associated with immune suppressionduring Schu S4 phagocytosis by macrophagesIn order to examine whether the initial interaction between F.tularensis and macrophages impacts host cell immune responses, wemeasured the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. TNFa, IL-6and IL-1b in the culture supernatant of hMDMs infected withSchu S4 in the absence or presence of fresh autologous serum.Surprisingly, despite the fact that there was a dramatic increase inbacterial uptake in the presence of serum, there was very limitedpro-inflammatory cytokine production suggesting that serumopsonization has an immunosuppressive effect during Schu S4phagocytosis. This effect is mainly contributed by C3 sinceincubation in C3-depleted serum led to relatively high levels ofcytokine production comparable to those observed in the absenceof serum, while the cytokine levels were decreased when C3 wasrepleted (Fig. 2A, B and C). Recent studies have shown that thelow virulent F. novicida induces high pro-inflammatory responses inhuman phagocytic cells [17,41]. In order to exam whether serumincubation has an immunosuppressive effect during the phagocy-tosis of human macrophages by F. novicida, we performed assayscomparing F. novicida and Schu S4 in the presence and absence ofserum. Consistent with previous studies [17,18], phagocytosis of F.novicida by hMDMs was accompanied by much higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production than that of Schu S4 (Fig. 2 D,E and F). In addition, serum did not have a significant immunesuppressive effect, indicating that C3 opsonin-mediated immunesuppression is specific to the highly virulent Schu S4.Recent studies have indicated that host adaptation can affect thenature of Francisella surface carbohydrates, which can in turn affectAuthor SummaryThe highly virulent Francisella tularensis can cause respi-ratory disease in humans with less than 10 bacteria. In vivo,it replicates mainly within macrophages. Evasion and/orsuppression of the host protective immune response isessential to Francisella\u2019s virulence in mammals. However,the detailed molecular mechanisms for this immunesuppression are not clear. Here we demonstrate that thispathogen manipulates the crosstalk between two impor-tant receptor-mediated pathways during entry in humanmacrophages: CR3-mediated phagocytosis and TLR2-me-diated pro-inflammatory responses. By optimally engagingCR3, Francisella not only gains efficient access to macro-phages but also dampens TLR2-mediated immune re-sponses, leading to a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 entry that allows itto replicate intracellularly to high numbers early on. Thus,we have identified an important mechanism that is criticalfor the success of F. tularensis as a human pathogen duringprimary infection.CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114Figure 1. C3 is required for Ft Schu S4 uptake by human macrophages. hMDMs were incubated with Schu S4 for 1 hr at an MOI of 50:1 inthe presence or absence of 10% autologous serum, C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or C3-repleted serum (C3-rpl).

Toexamine the effect of host adaptation on the immune suppressionobserved here, we used Schu S4 that had been passaged throughTHP-1 cells (Ft-T). As shown in Fig. S1, although host adapted Ft-T induced slightly less pro-inflammatory cytokine productioncompared with Ft that had not been passaged, serum-opsonizationstill significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory responses with Ft-T.This result provides further support that the inhibition mechanismobserved here does not depend on host adaptation. Thus, thefollowing experiments were carried out with Ft Schu S4 only.C3 opsonization inhibits MAPK activation duringphagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophagesF. tularensis LPS interacts poorly with TLR4 [43]. Instead, hostinflammatory responses to F. tularensis are mediated primarily byTLR2 which leads to the activation of MAPK and NF-kBsignaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production[44\u201349]. In order to explore the underlying mechanism for thesuppressed immune responses seen in the presence of serum andC3 opsonization, we examined the activation of MAPKs duringSchu S4 synchronized phagocytosis. Schu S4 was either non-opsonized or pre-opsonized with fresh autologous serum, C3-depleted or C3-repleted serum, and then incubated with hMDMsin the absence of serum. As shown in Fig. 3A, consistent with ourobservations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, activationof MAPKs (i.e. ERK1/2 and p38) was inhibited duringphagocytosis of serum-opsonized or C3-repleted serum-opsonizedSchu S4, whereas there was robust activation of ERK1/2 and p38in the absence of either serum or C3. This inhibition on MAPKactivation was only observed for ERK1/2 and p38, but not forJNK (Fig. 3B) In order to confirm the role of complement in theimmune suppression observed, we also infected hMDMs withSchu S4 pre-opsonized with heat-inactivated autologous serum.Phagocytosis of these bacteria was accompanied by levels ofERK1/2 and p38 activation equivalent to those seen with non-opsonized Schu S4 (data not shown). Together, these data indicatethat the immune suppression during C3-opsonized Schu S4phagocytosis is mediated, at least in part, by reduced ERK1/2 andp38 activation.Since we observed a much greater pro-inflammatory responseduring F. novicida phagocytosis than during Schu S4 phagocytosis(which was not affected by serum or C3), we also included F.novicida in parallel with Schu S4 in our experiments to assessMAPK activation. As expected, phagocytosis of F. novicida wasaccompanied by high levels of ERK1/2 and p38 activation both inthe presence and absence of serum, especially at the later timepoint (Fig. 3C) and was much less affected by serum opsonization.This indicates that C3-mediated MAPK inhibition is relativelyspecific to the highly virulent Schu S4.C3 opsonization inhibits NF-kB p65 activation andtranslocation during phagocytosis of Schu S4 by humanmacrophagesPhosphorylation of MAPKs leads to activation of manytranscription factors, including NF-kB, that are important ininflammatory cytokine production. Since we observed significantlydecreased activation of ERK 1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonizedSchu S4 infection, we examined whether this decreased activationleads to a reduction in downstream NF-kB activation. We infectedhMDMs with non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4 fordifferent time points and analyzed NF-kB p65 activation (phos-phorylation) by Western blot. As predicted, phagocytosis of serum-opsonized Schu S4 led to significantly reduced phosphorylation ofthe NF-kB p65 subunit (Fig. 4A and B). Activation of the NF-kBp65 subunit leads to translocation of p65 into the nucleus where itbinds to the promoter region of various genes to induce theirexpression. We measured NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleusby immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Our results show thatinfection with serum-opsonized Sch S4 is accompanied bysignificantly reduced p65 translocation compared to that of non-opsonized bacteria. These data provide strong evidence that C3opsonization of bacteria leads to early suppression of the host cellimmune response through inhibition of MAPKs and downstreamNF-kB activation.C3 opsonin-mediated immune suppression duringphagocytosis is not due to a difference in the kinetics ofuptake of Schu S4 or to bacterial factorsOne possible mechanism for the enhanced pro-inflammatorycytokine response seen during phagocytosis of non-opsonized SchuS4 is that limited CR3 engagement slows phagocytosis (throughCR3 or potentially other receptors) allowing for a proportionatelyincreased number of attached bacteria to engage TLR2 for alonger period of time. In order to test for this possibility, wesynchronized phagocytosis of non-opsonized or serum-opsonizedSchu S4 as in the MAPK activation assay, and fixed the samples atdifferent time points. We used a differential immunofluorescencestaining protocol [50] to quantify the attachment and uptake ofSchu S4 by hMDMs (Fig. 5A). At all time points examined (5, 15and 30 min) there were much greater numbers of serum-opsonized Schu S4 both attached to and taken up by hMDMscompared with non-opsonized bacteria, indicating that a differ-ence in the kinetics of phagocytosis was not the reason for theobserved immune suppression. The fact that F. tularensis can alsosignal through TLR2 from within phagosomes following phago-cytosis [51] also argues against the hypothesis that in the case ofnon-opsonized bacteria, prolonged cell surface binding results inenhanced cytokine production.Bacterial virulence factors, e.g. RipA, represent an alternatemechanism of immune suppression by C3-opsonized bacteria[52]. In this scenario, we expect cytokine production to decline asbacterial loads increase because the concentration of virulencefactors produced from viable bacteria within a macrophage isdirectly proportional to its bacterial load. In order to test thishypothesis, we infected hMDMs with non-opsonized or serum pre-opsonized Schu S4. In both cases we achieved an incrementalincrease in bacterial uptake by increasing the MOI. However,instead of resulting in increased immune suppression, increaseduptake resulted in a stepwise increase in pro-inflammatorycytokine production (Fig. 5B) and MAPK activation (Fig. 5C).This effect was more pronounced in the case of non-opsonizedbacteria [i.e., A 20 fold increase in MOI resulted in a 3 to 12 foldincrease in cytokine production for non-opsonized bacteria, andonly a 30% to 70% increase in cytokine production for opsonizedbacteria (Fig. 5B)]. These results indicate that early immunesuppression by Schu S4 during phagocytosis is not primarilymediated by virulence factors produced from viable bacteria. Wecarried out experiments with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-killed SchuS4 to further support this claim. In parallel with untreated SchuS4, PFA-killed Schu S4 was either non-opsonized or serum pre-opsonized, and used for infection. As shown in Fig. 5D, PFA-killedserum-opsonized Schu S4 was able to inhibit MAPK activation.Together, these results provide evidence that the immunesuppression observed during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized SchuS4 is not due to actively produced bacterial factors. However,these factors are predicted to play an important role duringsubsequent stages of infection.CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114CR3 is the major receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis byhuman macrophagesWe next examined the role of C3 receptors and the possiblecrosstalk between C3 receptors and TLR2 in mediating theimmune suppression during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized SchuS4. We elected to focus on CR3 (CD11b/CD18) which is themajor receptor for C3 opsonins, and has been implicated as theimportant receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by human phago-cytes [21]. We transfected hMDMs with scramble siRNA (control)or siRNA targeting CD11b, the latter to knockdown the a chain ofthe CR3 heterodimer (Fig. 6A and B). We then performedexperiments that quantify attachment and uptake of Schu S4 bycontrol and CD11b knockdown macrophages. Compared tocontrol siRNA transfected hMDMs, Schu S4 attachment anduptake were nearly abolished in CD11b knockdown cells,providing strong confirmatory evidence that CR3 is the majorreceptor for phagocytosis of the highly virulent Schu S4 strain byhuman macrophages (Fig. 6C and D).Several studies have indicated crosstalk between complementreceptor pathways and TLR pathways, especially for theinvolvement of TLRs in inside-out activation of CR3 [33,34,40].Therefore, we tested the possible involvement of TLR2 in Schu S4phagocytosis by hMDMs, since TLR2 is responsible for most ofthe cell surface TLR-driven host inflammatory responses followingFigure 3. Serum components, specifically C3 opsonization, inhibit ERK1/2 and p38 activation during Schu S4 phagocytosis bymacrophages. (A) Schu S4 was either non-opsonized, or pre-opsonized with 10% autologous serum, C3-depleted serum (C3d) or C3-repleted serum(C3r), and then used to infect hMDM monolayers at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH in the absence of serum. Infection was synchronized by centrifuging at2506g for 10 min at 4uC, and incubated at 37uC for 30 min. (B) Schu S4 was either non-opsonized, or pre-opsonized with 10% autologous serum, andthen used to infect hMDM monolayers at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH in the absence of serum. Infection was synchronized by centrifuging at 2506g for10 min at 4uC, and incubated at 37uC for 15 or 30 min. (C) Schu S4 (Ft) or F. novicida (Fn) were either non-opsonized or serum pre-opsonized, andthen used to infect hMDMs as in (A) for 30 or 60 min. MDMs lysates were subjected to Western Blot. Uninfected resting cells (R) were included ascontrol. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g003CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114F. tularensis infection [44,47\u201349]. We knocked down TLR2 inhMDMs using siRNA as we have described previously [53] andexamined Schu S4 attachment and uptake by these cells.Compared with control siRNA transfected cells, there was anapproximately 40% reduction in the attachment and uptake ofSchu S4 in TLR2 siRNA transfected cells (thus less than thatobserved with CD11b knockdown cells) at 15 min (Fig. 6C and D),which is consistent with the involvement of TLR2 in F. tularensisphagocytosis, possibly through inside-out activation of CR3.Similar data were seen at 5 min and a similar trend was seen at30 min, although at the later time point the high number ofbacteria per cell reduced the accuracy of the counting (Fig. S2).Inside-out signaling is further supported by an experiment showingthat the cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein Talin co-localizes withCR3, particularly in macrophages infected with serum pre-opsonized Ft (Fig. S3) [54].Phagocytosis-associated immune suppression of C3-opsonized F. tularensis is mediated by CR3In order to test the hypothesis that engagement of C3 receptorsenables outside-in crosstalk with the TLR2 pathway to inhibitTLR2-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory responses, weexamined cytokine production in CD11b or TLR2 knockdownmacrophages following phagocytosis of serum-opsonized versusnon-opsonized Schu S4 or F. novicida. We observed a significantreduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in TLR2 knock-down cells following non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4infection, consistent with a role for TLR2 in mediating host pro-inflammatory immune responses (Fig. 7A). However, even inTLR2 knockdown cells, cytokine production in response to serum-opsonized bacteria remained depressed as compared to non-opsonized bacteria, indicating that the immunosuppressive effectsof complement C3 in conjunction with Schu S4 do not depend onTLR2. In contrast, in CD11b knockdown cells, we observed thatthe selective immune suppression seen with opsonized bacteria wasabolished, providing evidence for CR3 in mediating immunesuppression following optimal engagement by C3-opsonized SchuS4 (Fig. 7B). As observed before, there was robust pro-inflammatory cytokine production following phagocytosis of F.novicida independent of opsonization status.We next examined MAPK activation upstream of cytokineproduction following phagocytosis of Schu S4 by control, CD11b orTLR2 knockdown hMDMs. In order to detect and examine thesignaling events immediately after receptor ligation, we increasedthe MOI to 250:1 and collected samples at 5, 15 and 30 min postinfection. As shown in Fig. 7C, in control siRNA transfected cells,both ERK and p38 activation were selectively inhibited uponinfection with serum pre-opsonized bacteria compared with non-opsonized bacteria, although maximal inhibition of each occurredat different time points (ERK and p38 activation were significantlylower at 5 min and 30 min post infection, respectively). Similar tothe results in Fig. 7A, in TLR2 knockdown cells MAPK activationwas reduced and the overall pattern between opsonized and non-opsonized bacteria was maintained; whereas in CD11b knockdownFigure 4. Serum opsonization of Schu S4 leads to inhibition of NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus duringphagocytosis by macrophages. (A) hMDMs were infected with pre-opsonized (10% autologous serum) or non-opsonized Schu S4 at an MOI of50:1 in RHH. Infection was synchronized by centrifuging at 2506g for 10 min at 4uC, and incubated at 37uC for different time points (159, 309 and 609).MDM lysates were subjected to Western Blot using Phospho NF-kB p65 or total p65 primary antibodies.

Nucleiwere stained with DAPI. NF-kB p65 translocation was scored using a total of 300 cells per experiment. The graph shown represents cumulative datafrom two independent experiments. The data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student t-test (** p,0.005, Student t-test).doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g004CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114cells, enhanced activation was observed for both ERK1/2 and p38following infection with serum-opsonized bacteria, now equivalentto the level seen with non-opsonized bacteria. Remarkably thisoccurred despite the fact that there was minimal phagocytosis bythese cells. Together, these results are consistent with a positive rolefor TLR2 and a negative role for CR3 in MAPK activation uponSchu S4 infection of human macrophages.Phagocytosis-associated immune suppression of serum-opsonized Schu S4 is mediated by the CR3 cytoplasmictailThe cytoplasmic tail of CR3 plays an important role in CR3-mediated signaling [55]. To directly assess the role of the CR3cytoplasmic tail in mediating immune suppression pathway(s)during the phagocytosis of serum-opsonized Schu S4, we usedCHO cells stably expressing full length heterodimeric CR3(CD11b/CD18) or a tail less mutant of CR3 (tail less CD11balong with CD18) and transiently transfected with functionalTLR2 [56]. Following incubation of serum-opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria for 15 or 30 min, CHO cell lysates wereharvested and analyzed for activation of ERK and p38 activation(phosphorylation) by Western blot. We found that the tail lessmutant form of CR3 was not able to inhibit the activation ofERK1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized Schu-S4 phagocytosis(Fig. 8A). To further validate that CR3 is an important receptorfor serum-opsonized Schu S4, we performed a cell associationassay with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria and CHOcells expressing full length or tail less mutant CR3. The resultsFigure 5. C3-mediated immune suppression is not due to a difference in the kinetics of Schu S4 phagocytosis.

Thehighly virulent Schu S4 exploits host defense mechanisms by usingCR3 as the phagocytic receptor which suppresses host defenseimmune responses by inhibiting MAPK activation. However, thequestion still remained as to the signaling cascade downstream ofCR3 that leads to MAPK inhibition.A recent study [29] showed that CD11b can negatively regulateTLR signaling by activating Syk and promoting the degradation ofMyD88 and TRIF. To explore this possibility, we examined theactivation of Syk upon infection with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4. Our results indicated that Syk is transientlyactivated upon Schu S4 infection, but there is no differencebetween serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu S4 infection atall time points studied (5, 15 and 30 min). Also MyD88 and TRIFprotein levels following serum-opsonized and non-opsonized SchuS4 infection are not changed (data not shown). Thus, these datasuggested that neither Syk nor Syk-mediated degradation ofMyD88 and TRIF is involved in CR3-mediated immunesuppression in human macrophages.CR3 belongs to the b2 integrin family. Src family kinases (SFKs)Hck, Fgr and Lyn are known to control b2 integrin signaltransduction in leukocytes [57]. Among these we were particularlyinterested in Lyn since it has been shown to play an important rolein host defense. Lyn deletion led to impaired phagocytosis,elevated inflammatory cytokine production and increased apop-tosis following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [58]. Lyn alsonegatively regulates TLR4 and TLR2 signaling in mousemacrophages and in vivo, which is partially mediated by thePI3K pathway [59].In order to answer the question whether Lyn is involved inCR3-mediated host immune suppression following Schu S4infection, we first explored whether Lyn is activated downstreamof CR3 and if so, whether its activation is affected by TLR2activation which can activate CR3 through inside-out signaling.hMDMs were transfected with control siRNA, or siRNA targetingCD11b or TLR2, and then infected with either serum-opsonizedor non-opsonized Schu S4. Lyn activation was measured byWestern blot. As shown in Fig. 9A, in control siRNA transfectedcells, Lyn was activated only when hMDMs were infected withserum pre-opsonized Schu S4 but not with non-opsonized SchuS4, consistent with the importance of C3 opsonization in LynFigure 6. CR3, partially activated by TLR2 inside-out signaling, is critical for Schu S4 phagocytosis by hMDMs. (A) hMDMs weretransfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNAs targeting CD11b or TLR2. 48 hrs later, the level of CD11b and TLR2 were examined by Western blot.

Moreover, when CR3 was knocked down, Lyn was nolonger activated, whereas TLR2 knockdown had no effect. Theseresults demonstrated that Lyn is activated downstream of CR3 butnot TLR2.In order to explore whether CR3-mediated host immunesuppression is mediated by Lyn, we selectively knocked down Lynby siRNA as described previously [60] (Fig. 9B). As shown in FigS4, Lyn knockdown greatly impaired the uptake of Schu S4 byhMDMs, providing evidence that Lyn is required for CR3-mediated phagocytosis. The effect of Lyn on the host immuneresponse was assessed by inflammatory cytokine productionfollowing Schu S4 infection. Compared with the limited immuneresponse in control siRNA transfected cells, Lyn knockdown led toa significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production,including TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b, following serum-opsonized SchuS4 infection (Fig. 9C) despite the impaired uptake, providingevidence for a critical role of Lyn in CR3-mediated host immunesuppression following Schu S4 infection.CR3 engagement leads to Akt activation and increasedMKP-1 expressionThe PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play a central role inthe host immune response during F. novicida infection [18],including the production of TNFa [61]. In contrast, a recent studyindicated that this pathway is involved in the immune suppressionfollowing LVS infection of mouse macrophages [62]. In support ofa role of PI3K/Akt in F. tularensis immune modulation, Lyn hasbeen shown to form a complex with PI3K/Akt in different celltypes [63,64] while TLR2 can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathwaythrough Rac1 [65]. In order to examine whether the PI3K/Aktpathway is involved in CR3-mediated immune suppression andcrosstalk with the TLR2 signaling pathway we infected controlsiRNA, CD11b siRNA or TLR2 siRNA-transfected hMDMs withserum pre-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 and thenexamined the activation of this pathway by Western blot. Asshown in Fig. 9A, 30 min after infection, the phospho-Akt levelwas consistently greater in hMDMs infected with serum-opsonizedSchu S4, compared with hMDMs infected with non-opsonizedbacteria, indicating that optimal engagement of CR3 at leasttransiently activates Akt. This was further supported by CD11bknockdown, which abolished the enhanced Akt activation seen incells infected with serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 (below the levelseen with non-opsonized bacteria). Besides CR3, TLR2 is alsoinvolved in Akt activation following Schu S4 infection (Fig. 9A).This was indicated by the increased level of phospho-Akt whencells are infected with non-opsonized bacteria which will engageCR3 in a limited fashion. Moreover, the increase seen followingserum pre-opsonization was reduced in TLR2 siRNA transfectedcells. As Akt is downstream of both pathways this could be animportant point where the two pathways crosstalk.Figure 7.

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can dephos-phorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residuesthus serving as important negative regulators of MAPKs [66]. Inorder to examine if MKPs are involved in CR3-mediated immunesuppression, we assessed MKP-1 levels during Schu S4 infection ofhMDMs. Consistent with our observation of increased Akt anddecreased MAPK levels upon infection with serum-opsonizedSchu S4, the MKP-1 level also increased rapidly after serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 infection but not following infection with non-opsonized bacteria, suggesting a role for CR3 engagement.Consistent with this possibility, the increased MKP-1 level wasabolished when CD11b was knocked down (Fig. 9A). In contrast,there was no effect following TLR2 knockdown. Together, thesedata map a pathway for CR3-mediated immune suppression thatincludes activation of Lyn and Akt, and an increased level ofMKP-1.DiscussionF. tularensis is highly virulent with a very low dose of infection,which is often lethal before a fully effective adaptive immuneresponse can be mounted [67,68]. This high virulence and rapidlethality are at least partially due to the ability of F. tularensis tosubvert or suppress host pro-inflammatory immune responses[16,69]. F. tularensis infection of macrophages and dendritic cellsleads to very limited secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokinesIL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa [13\u201315,70] and unresponsiveness tosubsequent stimulation by TLR agonists [14,15]. In the currentstudy, we provide evidence for a pathway that links CR3-mediatedphagocytosis for F. tularensis with immune suppression that involvescrosstalk with TLR2.Complement component C3 deposition on the F. tularensissurface has been previously characterized [25,71], and optimaluptake of the highly virulent strain by human macrophagesrequires C3 deposition and its receptor CR3 [21]. Despite the factthat significantly more bacteria are phagocytosed by humanmacrophages in the presence of serum or C3, to our surprise weobserved very limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production alongwith decreased activation of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, and NF-kB under this condition. We excluded the possibilities that this C3-mediated immune suppression was due to a difference in thekinetics of phagocytosis or possible involvement of certain bacterialcomponents/virulence factors, and confirmed the role of CR3 inthis immune suppression via siRNA knockdown of the receptor.Further we provide direct evidence for the requirement of theCR3 cytoplasmic tail for C3 opsonized F. tularensis-mediatedsuppression of immune function in human macrophages. Inaddition we identify a pathway downstream of CR3 leading toimmune suppression that includes Lyn, Akt and MKP-1. Theengagement of CR3 leads to activation of Lyn, and the role of Lynin immune suppression was confirmed by siRNA knockdown.CR3 engagement also led to transient activation of Akt and anincreased level of MKP-1. These findings are consistent with theinhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 activation as well as limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production following Schu S4 infection.Thus, we identify a key pathway that links a receptor critical for F.tularensis phagocytosis with post-phagocytic signaling eventsimportant for immune suppression following Schu S4 infection,and the crosstalk downstream of two critical receptors in innateimmunity: CR3 and TLR2 (Fig. 10).The crosstalk revealed here is complex and involves interactionsbetween TLR2 signaling and both inside-out and outside-insignaling of CR3 by F. tularensis. First, CR3 is required for efficientF. tularensis phagocytosis while TLR2 is also partially involved.This is likely through inside-out activation of CR3 which proceedsthrough Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34] and involves theactin cytoskeleton-binding protein talin (Fig. S3). The activatedCR3 will then efficiently bind C3bi-coated bacteria, generate CR3outside-in signaling involving Lyn and Akt, and negatively regulateTLR2-mediated immune responses by limiting the activation ofMAPKs through increased MKP-1. Another possibility we cannotexclude from our studies is that the inhibition of TLR2 signalinghappens at the level of receptor ligation. For example, it is possiblethat C3 deposition on F. tularensis can block the recognition ofTLR2 ligands on the bacterial surface. In this regard, a recentstudy showed that F. tularensis grown in different media has distinctbacterial surface structures, which in certain cases shields TLR2ligands on the bacterial surface and consequently blocks the hostimmune response [42]. The net result of CR3 engagement by F.tularensis is efficient phagocytosis and limited immune response.Although CR3 is present on the very cells that are meant tocontrol F. tularensis infection, it allows for a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019means of entry to macrophages.We consistently observed a difference in the kinetics of ERK1/2and p38 inhibition in our study. While the inhibition of ERK1/2occurred as early as 5 min post infection, inhibition of p38 was notoptimal until 30 min (Fig. 7B). This difference in kinetics hasimplications for MKP-1 regulation and function. In our study, thelevel of MKP-1 was not increased until 15 to 30 minutes postinfection. In addition, although MKP-1 can deactivate ERK1/2when it is highly induced, p38 is its preferred substrate [66].Therefore taken together, although our current model of thesignaling cascade can explain the inhibition of p38 activation,other mechanisms are likely to be involved in the early inhibitionof ERK1/2. Further studies are underway to characterize themechanisms enabling early ERK1/2 inhibition. Insight is provid-ed by the modeling of C3-opsonized F. tularensis engagement ofCR3 [72].The observed CR3-mediated immune suppression is relativelyspecific to Schu S4. This is different from the immune suppressionmediated by RipA, a Francisella protein that is conserved in allsubspecies [52]. In our studies, F. novicida induced a much morerobust immune response than Schu S4. In addition, serum or C3had very little suppressive effect. F. novicida always has a muchhigher phagocytosis rate than Schu S4 in the absence and presenceof serum (data not shown) suggesting the two strains use differentmeans of cellular entry. Thus, differences in the early immuneresponse to Schu S4 and F. novicida can be at least partly due totheir engaging different receptors during phagocytosis. Forexample, it is possible that F. novicida more efficiently engagesboth CR3 and Fcc receptors during phagocytosis, leading to amore robust immune response. Abundant natural antibody hasbeen found on the surface of F. novicida that is capable of engagingFcc receptors [19]. Consistent with the notion that immunesuppression is critical for the success of F. tularensis as a humanpathogen, Schu S4 is highly virulent in humans whereas F. novicidais not. Beyond this, our studies do not rule out differences inbacterial surface-exposed ligands between Schu S4 and F. novicidathat would still be present after PFA treating bacteria that couldengage different receptors. We believe that differences in receptor-ligand interactions at the macrophage surface will lead tosignificant differences in the host cell response due to associated,unique, combinatorial signaling events.The negative regulatory role of the PI3K/Akt pathway on pro-inflammatory immune responses has been demonstrated in otherstudies [73\u201375] including a recent study with LVS infection ofmouse macrophages, which identified the role of Akt and MKP-1CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114in the immune suppression [62]. As LVS has a similar level ofphagocytosis as Schu S4 (which is lower than that seen with F.novicida), and efficient uptake also requires serum-opsonization[19], it is possible that LVS uses a similar pathway as Schu S4 forimmunosuppression. At a later stage of infection (24 h postinfection), F. novicida activates while Schu S4 inhibits the PI3K/Aktpathway by differentially regulating SHIP-1 through induction ofmiR-155 [41]. Our studies support the idea that the induction ofbroad immune suppression by F. tularensis in the host occurs atmultiple levels and by different mechanisms during the course ofinfection. The current study provides evidence that immunesuppression mechanisms are initiated at the earliest state ofinfection, i.e. during the phagocytic process itself.In addition to CR3, other complement receptors might alsoplay a role during F. tularensis phagocytosis. C3bi can also berecognized by CR4 (CD11c/CD18) and CRIg [76]. Thesereceptors might also be involved in the immune suppressionobserved during F. tularensis infection in the presence of serum. Inaddition, C1q is deposited on the F. tularensis surface (Clay CD &Schlesinger LS, manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, C1qsuppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production byNF-kB inhibition and CREB activation [77\u201379]. Opsono-phago-cytosis of C1q-bound apoptotic cells occurs via CD91/calreticulin[80] and is immunosuppressive. Thus, it is intriguing tohypothesize that C1q receptors might also be involved in theimmune suppression observed here. We are further exploring thispossibility.Signaling events associated with the complement systemhave been examined in the case of other pathogens. For exam-ple, P. gingivalis can cleave C5 to release C5a, which activatesFigure 10. Model of CR3-mediated immune suppression and crosstalk with TLR2 signaling during the phagocytosis of Schu S4 byhuman macrophages. In the absence of serum, pathogen associated molecular determinants such as lipoproteins will be recognized by TLR2which activates MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38) and NF-kB signaling pathways, and induces host pro-inflammatory responses. Phagocytosis is limitedwithout the optimal engagement of CR3. In the presence of serum C3bi is deposited on the Ft Schu S4 surface, which optimally engages CR3 andenhances phagocytosis. At the same time, TLR2 is activated at least to some degree, leading to inside-out activation of CR3, which contributes toenhanced outside-in CR3 signaling and increased phagocytosis. CR3-mediated signaling activates Lyn and AKT, and leads to an increased MKP-1 levelwhich results in inhibition of MAPK activity. This allows for increased phagocytosis simultaneously with a dampened host immune response.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g010CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114intracellular Ca2+signaling and cAMP, leading to impairediNOS-dependent killing in macrophages [81]. P. gingivalis canactivate CR3 through inside-out activation downstream ofTLR2 signaling, induces ERK1/2, and selectively down-regulates IL-12 expression [82,83]. Blastomyces dermatitidis usesBAD1, a virulent factor on the pathogen surface to engage CR3for TNFa suppression and immune evasion by unknownmechanisms [84]. In addition to its role in the phagocytosis ofbacteria, CR3 is also responsible for clearance of C3bi-coatedapoptotic cells without initiating vigorous immune responses[85]. In this context, CR3 ligation is immunosuppressive [86]and can inhibit IL-12 production [37,87]. Although inside-outactivation of CR3 through TLR2 has been reported for otherpathogens [33,34,40], our data provide evidence that F. tularensisis able to take advantage of both inside-out and outside-insignaling of CR3 to achieve efficient entry as well as immunesuppression for its own survival. Thus, we provide newinformation on how outside-in signaling of CR3 by a pathogencan negatively regulate TLR signaling. CR3 is a major receptorfor intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacteria [88], Leishmania[89,90] and Legionella [91]. Therefore it will be interesting toinvestigate whether these pathogens also employ similarsignaling mechanisms related to CR3 in order to enhance theirsurvival during infection. In this regard, during infection ofmurine macrophages with Mycobacterium avium, C3-depletionresults in a significantly higher level of TNFa production [92].TLR2, PI3K and cytohesin-1 mediated inside-out activation ofCR3 has also been found to play a role in the phagocytosis ofMycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [34]. In thecase of Leishmania, ligation of CR3 has been shown to inhibit theproduction of IL-12 [93].During the course of our studies, we entertained the idea ofextending them to the mouse model using CR3 knockout mice.We first examined the activation of ERK, p38 and Akt duringserum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 synchronizedphagocytosis by mouse bone marrow derived macrophages(BMDMs) from wild type C57/Bl mice. In stark contrast to theresults obtained with human macrophages, the activation ofERK and p38 was significantly enhanced in mouse BMDMsincubated with serum-opsonized Schu S4 compared to non-opsonized Schu S4 (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the C3opsonin-mediated inhibitory effect of Schu S4 on MAPKs isspecific to human macrophages. In this regard, there isgrowing evidence that the mouse model does not recapitulatehuman disease for a number of infectious agents. In fact, bothSchu S4 and F. novicida are highly virulent in mice whereasonly the former is highly virulent in humans. Beyond this, weand others are beginning to see major differences betweenmice and man (and their cells), particularly in the innateimmune system, where the array of PRRs on macrophages, forexample, and their signaling cascades are quite different[94,95].In summary, our results demonstrate a pathway that links animportant phagocytic receptor, CR3, on human macrophageswith the down-regulation of host immune responses that allowsfor an efficient, but relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 mode of entry of thehighly virulent F. tularensis. This involves active crosstalkbetween CR3- and TLR2-mediated signaling pathways. CR3-mediated immune suppression can be an important strategyused by F. tularensis for its success as a human pathogen. Theseresults have broader implications in understanding the patho-genesis of other intracellular pathogens as well as the crosstalkbetween different PRRs and phagocytic receptors, especiallyTLRs and integrins.Materials and MethodsBacterial strainsF. novicida U112 (Fn) was obtained from ATCC and F. tularensissubspecies tularensis Schu S4 strain (Ft) was generously provided byDr. Rick Lyons (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).The bacteria were cultured on Chocolate II plates (BectonDickinson, Sparks, MD).

After transfection cells were immediately re-suspendedin 1 ml of RPMI with 10% autologous serum and plated in 12-well tissue culture plate for Western Blotting and cytokine assays,or in 24-well tissue culture plates with acid-treated glass coverslipsfor confocal microscopy studies. After 2\u20133 hrs of attachment at37uC with 5% CO2 hMDM monolayers were washed with warmRPMI, repleted with warm RPMI containing 20% autologousserum, and incubated at 37uC 5% CO2 for additional 48 hrs.CHO cell TLR2 transfectionThe functional TLR2-expressing plasmid (YFP-TLR2) wastransfected into CHO cells by using lipofectamine reagent(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Briefly CHO cells stablyexpressing full length CR3 or the tail less mutant form of CR3were plated in 6 well (2.06106/well) or 24 well (2.06105/well)plates and incubated for overnight. The cells were washed,replenished with HAMs F12 media without serum, and theplasmid DNA lipofectamine complex was prepared according tothe manufacturer\u2019s instructions and mixed with CHO cells. After24 hrs of incubation cells were washed and replenished withHAMs F12 media with serum, incubated for 24 hrs and used forinfections.Francisella infection of hMDMs and CHO cells: uptake andassociation assaysF. novicida or Schu S4 was cultured on Chocolate agar plates for16 hrs and 40 hrs, respectively. Bacteria were re-suspended inPBS, and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was approximated bymeasuring the optical density of the bacterial suspension at600 nm, and confirmed by plating the inocula and countingCFUs. Bacteria were incubated with hMDM monolayers at anMOI of 50 in RHH (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, 10 mMHEPES and 0.25% human serum albumin) or RHS (RPMI 1640with L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES and serum) with 10%autologous serum, 10% C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or 10% C3-repleted serum (C3-rpl) for 15 min on a nutator for equaldistribution, and then under stationary condition for another45 min at 37uC, 5% CO2. Following infection, MDMs werewashed with warm RPMI 1640 and incubated with 50 mg/mlgentamycin at 37uC 5%CO2 for 30 min to kill extracellularbacteria. MDM monolayers were then washed with PBS, lysedwith 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and Francisella uptake wasnumerated by serial dilution of the lysates and plated on chocolateagar plates for CFUs. MDMs were also fixed with 2%paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed byan inside/outside differential staining protocol for attached andingested bacteria as described below.For CHO cell infections, transfected cells in incomplete HAMsF12 media were incubated with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 at an MOI of 50. Infections were synchronizedby centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min and incubated at 37uC,5% CO2 for different time points. At each time point the cells werewashed and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer for Western blot or fixedwith 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperaturefollowed by staining for Schu S4 for microscopy studies asdescribed below.hMDM infection, lysis and Western blottingF. novicida and Schu S4 were prepared as described above.Before infection, bacteria were pre-opsonized with 10% autolo-gous serum, C3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum at 37uC for30 min, washed with ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in ice-coldPBS. A non-opsonized sample incubated with PBS instead ofserum was also included in all experiments. MDM monolayerswere washed with warm RPMI 1640, replenished with RHH andpre-chilled at 4uC for 10 min. Opsonized or non-opsonizedbacteria were added to MDMs, and infections were synchronizedby centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min. hMDMs were thenreturned to 37uC 5% CO2 and incubated for the specified times.Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer[50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7,10 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mMNa3VO4, and 10 mg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin],incubated at 4uC for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 16,0006 gat 4uC for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. Protein concentrationsof the cleared cell lysates were measured using the Pierce BCA-protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Samples weresubjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Westernblot with the different antibodies of interest. Protocols for CHOcell infections, cell lysis and Western blotting were the same.Cytokine ELISAsMDMs were infected with F. novicida or Schu S4 without pre-opsonization in RHH or with RHS plus 10% autologous serum,C3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum for 1 h as describedabove. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs postinfection. Cytokine concentrations (TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6) weremeasured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) accordingto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Immunofluorescence microscopyhMDMs were infected with F. novicida or F. tularensis Schu S4 atspecified MOIs for different time points Monolayers were washedthree times with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehydefollowed by an inside/outside differential staining protocol todifferentiate extracellular and intracellular bacteria as previouslydescribed [50]. Briefly, after blocking with 5% goat serum and0.5% BSA extracellular bacteria were detected with a monoclonalmouse anti-Ft LPS antibody FB11 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for3 hrs at room temperature followed by an AF-488 conjugated goatanti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells were then permeabilizedwith 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min,CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for FrancisellaPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.5% BSA in PBS, incubatedwith the same primary antibody for 3 hr at room temperaturefollowed by incubation with an AF-546 conjugated secondaryantibody for 1 hr at room temperature. This allowed for thedifferential staining of extracellular (stained with both AF488 andAF546, shown as yellow or green) and intracellular (stained withonly AF546, shown as red) bacteria. Host cell nuclei were stainedwith 0.05 mg/ml of 49, 69-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) atroom temperature for 5 min.The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and viewed usingan Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope. For quantifica-tion purposes, triplicate samples of at least 300 cells per groupwere counted on an Olympus BX51 epi-fluorescence microscope,and the results are presented as mean 6 SD of representative dataof at least three independent experiments.For Talin co-localization experiments, hMDMs were infectedwith serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 at MOI of 50 for30 min at 37uC using the synchronized phagocytosis assay. Cellswere washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2% parafor-maldehyde followed by antibody staining for CD11b and Talin.Briefly, cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 inPBS at room temperature for 15 min, blocked with 5% goat serumand 0.5% BSA in PBS, incubated with CD11b antibody for 3 hrs,washed 3 times, and incubated with Talin antibody for 3 hrs atroom temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with ananti-mouse AF488 (CD11b) and anti-rabbit AF594 (Talin)secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. The nucleiwere stained with DAPI. For NF-kB p65 translocation studies inhMDMs, infected cells were fixed, permeabilized and blocked asdescribed above, and incubated with NF-kB p65 antibody for3 hrs at room temperature followed by anti-rabbit AF594secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI.Statistical analysisExperiments were carried out independently at least 3 timeswith different donors. Results varied among donors but thepatterns were the same with internal controls in each experiment.Representative results are shown. Prism software (GraphPad) wasused to determine the statistical significance of differences in themeans of experimental groups. An unpaired, two-tailed Student t-test was used when comparing the means from two groups of dataand a 1-Way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s Multiple Comparison Testwas used when comparing three or more groups. The pvalue,0.05 were considered significant (*p,0.05, **p,0.005,and ***p,0.001).Supporting InformationFigure S1 Host adaptation does not affect serum-mediated immune suppression by human macrophages.Host adapted Schu S4 (Ft-T) was obtained by passaging bacteriathrough THP-1 cells. hMDMs were infected with Ft-T or non-passaged Ft Schu S4 at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH or RHS with10% autologous serum. Extracellular bacteria were killed with50 mg/ml gentamycin at 37uC for 30 min. Media was replenishedand cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs postinfection. TNFa (A) and IL-1b (B) concentrations were measuredby ELISAs. Uninfected resting cells (R) were included as a control.Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.
