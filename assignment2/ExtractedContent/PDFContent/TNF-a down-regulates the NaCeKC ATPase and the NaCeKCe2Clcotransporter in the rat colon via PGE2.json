This work studies the effect of the cytokine on electrolyte and water movements in the rat distal colon using an intestinalperfusion technique and attempts to determine its underlying mechanism of action. TNF-a inhibited net water and chlorideabsorption, down-regulated in both surface and crypt colonocytes the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter, and reduced the proteinexpression and activity of the NaCeKC ATPase. Indomethacin up-regulated the pump and the cotransporter in surface cells butnot in crypt cells, and in its presence, TNF-a could not exert its effect, suggesting an involvement of PGE2 in the cytokine action.The effect of TNF-a on the pump and symporter was studied also in cultured Caco-2 cells in isolation of the effect of other cells andtissues, to test whether the cytokine acts directly on intestinal cells. In these cells, TNF-a and PGE2 had a similar effect on the pumpexpression and activity as that observed in crypt cells but were without any effect on the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter. It wasconcluded that the effect of the cytokine on colonocytes is mediated via PGE2. By inhibiting the NaCeKC ATPase, it reduces theNaCgradient needed for NaCl absorption, and by down-regulating the expression of the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter, it reducesbasolateral Cl\ufffdentry and luminal Cl\ufffdsecretion. The inhibitory effect on absorption is more significant than the inhibitory effect onsecretion resulting in a decrease in net electrolyte uptake and consequently in more water retention in the lumen.\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionThere is increasing evidence nowadays that multipleand complex interactions exist between inflammatorymediators and disturbances in ion transport processesthat occur in bacterial, parasitic and autoimmuneinflammatory diseases of the large intestine [1e3].Today, three cytokines are known to be implicated inbowel inflammation namely interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumornecrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 [4].

They include twomain entities: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis(UC), and are characterized by chronic inflammation ofthe digestive tract with a prominent infiltration of affectedtissues by lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, andmast cells [4]. Increased levels of the pro-inflammatorycytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a have beendetected in IBD, and TNF-a is believed to play a pivotalrole in its pathogenesis. The cytokine\u2019s level waselevated in mononuclear cells of the lamina propriaisolated from patients inflicted with the disease and itsadministration for 10 days produced chronic inflamma-tion of the intestinal lamina propria and submucosa [5].TNF-a caused also a 640-fold increase in the medianmailto:sawkreyd@aub.edu.lbhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666320 S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327serum concentration in patients with UC as comparedto healthy donors [6].Although the increase in the level of pro-inflammatorycytokines has been well established, its correlation withthe disease symptoms, mainly diarrhea and disturbedelectrolyte and water movements, has not been welldocumented.Diarrhea results from a decrease in net waterabsorption. Changes in water transport across the colonepithelium follow changes in net Na movements [7]. Themammalian colon absorbs sodium and chloride, andsecretes potassium, bicarbonate, and chloride [8,9].Under control conditions net absorption prevails [10],while secretory activities become apparent only uponstimulation by secretagogues [11].NaCabsorption can be electrogenic via NaCchannels ENaC and is confined to the surface epitheliumand upper part of the crypt [12] or electroneutral viaparallel NaC/HCand Cl\ufffd/HCO3\ufffdexchange and ispresent in both crypts and surface epithelium [13,14].In the rat and mouse colon, neutral NaCl absorption isdominant and is driven by the NaCgradient establishedby the NaCeKC pump.Secretion of Cl\ufffdand KCoccurs through theirrespective channels present on the luminal side and isalso geared indirectly by the NaCeKC pump, since it isdependent on the activity of the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffdsymporter which is itself energized by the NaCgradientestablished by the ATPase.Although secretion is commonly believed to berestricted to crypt colonocytes, recent studies haveshown that electrolyte secretion can occur in bothsurface and crypt epithelia [9,12].Since the NaCeKC ATPase is a major regulator ofthe transporters responsible for absorptive and secretoryprocesses, any change in its activity is expected to lead tochanges in net NaCand consequently water movements.An increase in electrolyte secretion and a decrease inelectrolyte absorption have been reported in inflamma-tory bowel diseases [15,16] together with elevated levelsof TNF-a. Whether the cytokine is responsible for theobserved diarrhea and targets the NaCeKC pump hasnot been clearly elucidated. The aim of this work is tostudy the effect of TNF-a on net water and chloridemovements in the rat colon, and determine its mecha-nism of action by studying its effects on the NaCeKCpump and the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter.2. MethodsMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) weigh-ing 150e200 g were used and handled all through inaccordance with the Guide for Laboratory AnimalFacilities and Care, US Department of Health, Educationand Welfare.All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (SigmaChemical Co., St Louis, MP, USA). RecombinantHuman TNF alpha was purchased from Endogen,MA, USA.Rabbit anti-NaCeKC ATPase a1 polyclonal anti-body and anti-rabbit IgG HPR conjugated antibodywere purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, NY, USA.The expression of the a1 catalytic subunit was studiedbecause it is the main isoform present in the intestine[17]. Rabbit anti-rat NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporterantibody was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic In-ternational, TX, USA.The human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) wasa generous gift from Dr. Mark Donowitz from JohnsHopkins University, USA.2.1. Effect of TNF-a on net water and chloridemovements in the rat colonRats were injected i.p. with different doses of TNF-a (100, 170 or 200 ng/100 gBW) 4 h prior to the beginningof the experiment. The doses and time point have beenselected based on a previous work with IL-1b [18]. Whenthe effect of indomethacin was studied, it was injected i.p.(1 mg/100 g BW) 10 min before TNF-a. TNF-a wasadministered in physiological saline while indomethacinwas dissolved in DMSO (3 mg/100 ml) and then added tophosphate buffer (0.088 M NaCl; 0.01 M Na2HPO4;8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) to a final concentration of4 mg/ml. Control rats received a similar volume of thedifferent vehicles.At the time of the experiment rats were anesthetizedby i.p. injection of pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g BW) andtheir abdomen opened through a midline incision. Asegment of the distal colon was isolated, making sure tokeep the mesenteries and vasculature intact, and wasperfused for 15 min with Krebs-improved Ringer buffer(KIRB) (123.3 mM NaCl; 6.17 mM KCl; 3.29 mMCaCl2$7H2O; 0.78 mM MgSO4$7H2O; 32.14 mM NaH-CO3; 1.54 mM KH2PO4; 6.4 mM sodium pyruvate;6.4 mM sodium glutamate; 7 mM sodium fumarate;11.1 mM glucose) at a rate of 0.7 ml/min to clear it fromwastes. In a second step the colon was perfused with thesame buffer and at the same rate for 30 min, but theeffluent was collected and its volume measured. Bufferswere oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) at 37\ufffdC and thentheir pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl or NaOH.At the end of the second perfusion, the perfusedsegment was excised, cut longitudinally, its width andlength measured and its surface area determined. Watermovements during the second 30-min perfusion stepwere calculated as the difference in volume between theinfused and collected buffers divided by the surface areaof the perfused colon.Chloride was measured by titration according toMohr\u2019s method [19] and net chloride absorption was321S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327calculated as the difference between the total number ofmoles present in the infused and collected buffers,divided by the area of the colon perfused.2.2. PGE2 involvementTo study the involvement of PGE2 in the response toTNF-a, indomethacin was used as an inhibitor of COX-enzymes which inhibits both COX-1, the constitutiveenzyme and COX-2 the cytokine-inducible isozyme, andis not specific to any one of them. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg BW) was injected i.p. 10 min before the injection ofTNF-a.2.3. Preparation of crude membranes from colonicsurface and crypt cellsSurface and crypt cells were isolated from the colonand characterized as described by Homaidan et al. [20].The isolated cells were re-suspended in a Tris buffer(buffer A) (200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2$6H2O; 2 mMEGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4), andhomogenized in a glasseTeflon homogenizer with 20strokes at 2100 rpm (Arthur Thomas Scientific Appa-ratus, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and then spun for 10 minat 1000g and 4 \ufffdC. A crude membrane fraction was thenprepared by centrifuging the supernatant collected for10 min at 33,000g, and was saved after the addition ofprotease inhibitors to assay later on for the NaCeKCATPase activity and determine the protein expression ofthe pump and the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter asdescribed below. All steps in the preparation of thehomogenate were conducted at 4 \ufffdC. The percentrecovery of the NaCeKC ATPase activity in the crudemembrane homogenate for both surface and cryptranged between 84 and 92% while the percent recoveryof the cotransporter, determined by western blotanalysis ranged between 79 and 88%.2.4. Culture and treatment of Caco-2 cellsCaco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s MinimalEssential Medium (DMEM) containing 4500 mg/LGlucose and supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum,Penicillin (100 mg/ml) and Streptomycin (100 mg/ml), ina humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37\ufffdC.The cells were treated when 80% confluent fordifferent time periods with different concentrations ofTNF-a to determine the optimal dose and incubationperiod. When the effect of indomethacin or PGE2 wasstudied they were added at a respective concentration of100 mM and 1 nM (chosen based on a previous workconducted on Caco-2 cells and LLC-PK1 [21,22] andwere dissolved, respectively, in DMSO and ethanol.Indomethacin was added 15 min prior to TNF-a.

At the end of the incubation period, cells werewashed, then lysed and homogenized in a polytronhomogenizer at 20,000e22,000 rpm and 4 \ufffdC, and spunsuccessively for 10 min at 1000g and 33,000g at 4 \ufffdC toremove nuclear and mitochondrial fraction and improvespecific activity and yield.The supernatant was collected, and after addition ofprotease inhibitors (Protease inhibitors, Complete\ufffd, R)were used for western blot analysis or to assay for theNaCeKC ATPase activity. The Bio-Rad assay was usedfor protein determination.2.5. NaCeKC ATPase assayMembrane homogenates were diluted in Tris buffer(buffer A) to a final concentration of 2 mg protein/mland incubated for 30-min with saponin (0.02% finalconcentration) at room temperature. Samples (50 ml)were then pre-incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 10 min in presenceor absence of ouabain (4 mM final concentration). Thereaction was later on initiated by addition of ATP toa final concentration of 1.25 mM and terminated after1 h of incubation at 37 \ufffdC by addition of trichloroaceticacid (200 ml, 11%). The amount of inorganic phosphateliberated was measured colorimetrically according to themethod of Taussky and Shorr [23], and the activity ofthe enzyme was determined by measuring the ouabain-inhibitable inorganic phosphate released.The percent inhibition of the enzyme activity wascalculated as follows:1\ufffdPi\u00f0treatment\u00de \ufffdPi\u00f0treatmentCouabain\u00dePi\u00f0control\u00de \ufffdPi\u00f0controlCouabain\u00de!1002.6.

ThePVDF membrane was then washed, blocked andincubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with a rabbit polyclonalanti-NaCeKCATPase a1 IgG (Upstate biotechnology,Lake Placid, NY 12946, USA), or with a rabbit anti-ratpolyclonal sodium potassium chloride cotransporterantibody (Alpha Diagnostic International, TX, USA).Detection of the signal was enhanced by usingchemiluminescence luminol reagent (Santa Cruiz Bio-technology Inc., CA, USA).2.7.

Net chloride absorption was alsodecreased at 170 and 300 ng/100 g BW (Fig. 1b).Since the maximal inhibitory effects of the cytokineappeared at 170 ng/100 g BW, this dose was consideredoptimal and was used later on in all subsequentexperiments.3.2. Involvement of PGE2To see whether the effect of TNF-a is mediated viaPGE2 production, the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymeswere inhibited with indomethacin (1 mg/100 g BW),injected 10 min before TNF-a. Indomethacin alone didnot have any effect on net water or chloride absorptionbut abrogated completely that of TNF-a (Fig. 2a and b).3.3.

Indomethacin alone up-regulated the pump in surface cells but did not have anyeffect in crypt colonocytes.

Effect of TNF-a on the activity of theNaCeKC ATPase in colon surface andcrypt cells isolated from treated ratsIn parallel to the protein expression, TNF-a (170 ng/100 g BW) inhibited significantly the activity of theNaCeKCATPase in surface and crypt cells isolatedfrom treated animals, by 87 and 92%, respectively(Fig. 5). Pre-treatment with indomethacin, led to 100%recovery of the enzymatic activity in both types of cells,abrogating thus the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 5) andsuggesting that the cytokine exerts its effect throughPGE2.3.5. Effect of TNF-a on the protein expressionof the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter in surfaceand crypt colonocytes isolated from treated ratsBecause the diarrhea that accompanies elevated levelsof TNF-a in IBD may result from increased watersecretion, and since the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporteris involved in secretory processes, we opted to studythe effect of TNF-a on the protein expression of thecotransporter. In both surface and crypt cells, thecytokine down-regulated the cotransporter (Fig. 6).Indomethacin, on the other hand caused an up-regulation in surface cells (around 12-folds), and in itspresence the effect of TNF-a did not appear neither insurface nor in crypt cells.3.6. Time and dose dependent effect of TNF-aon the expression of a1 subunit of the NaCeKCATPase in Caco-2 cellsTNF-a reduced in a dose and time dependentmanner, the protein expression of the alpha-1 subunitof the NaCeKC ATPase in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 7).

DiscussionThis work demonstrated a decrease in net water andchloride absorption from the colon of rats injected withTNF-a (Fig. 2a and b) which could be due to eithera decrease in absorption or an increase in secretion[11,24] or both. Water movements are geared by theosmotic gradient that results from the different distri-bution of electrolytes across the plasma membrane,mainly NaC.Absorption of NaCl in the rat distal colon is mainlyelectroneutral [25] via parallel NaC/HCand Cl\ufffd/HCO3\ufffdexchange. The driving force for this transport processderives from the NaCgradient established by the NaCeKCpump. Since the activity and protein expressionof the NaCeKC ATPase were reduced in both surfaceand crypt colonocytes isolated from rats treated withTNF-a (Figs. 3e5), the pump seems to be a direct siteof action for the cytokine, causing a decrease in theNaCgradient and net NaCl absorption, and conse-quently, a decrease in water uptake which usuallyfollows electrolyte movements by osmosis.It has been recently demonstrated that secretion canoccur in both surface and crypt epithelia [26] andinvolves the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter and theNaCeKC ATPase situated both on the basolateral side.Chloride, sodium and potassium ions are taken up bythe cotransporter from the serosal fluid using the NaCgradient established by the pump. Sodium is pumpedout back by the NaCeKC ATPase while KC ions areControl TNF-\u03b1 TNF-\u03b1+indoindoNaKCl2\u03b2 actinFig. 11.

This work has demon-strated a decrease in the protein expression of the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter in both surface and crypt cells(Fig. 6). Down-regulation of the cotransporter isexpected to decrease basolateral Cl\ufffdentry and Cl\ufffdsecretion.A possible involvement of PGE2 in the action ofTNF-a was previously suspected in the colon [28]. Tosee whether the effect of TNF-a on water and chlorideabsorption is mediated via PGE2, indomethacin wasused as an inhibitor of PGE2 synthesis.In surface cells the protein expression of the NaCeKCATPase and the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter was up-regulated by indomethacin (Figs. 3 and 6) and in itspresence the effect of TNF-a on the two transporters didnot appear. These results suggest that PGE2 is involvedin the regulation of the basal expression of bothtransporters and is indeed a mediator of TNF-a action.Up-regulation of the pump in presence of indomethacinwas not accompanied by an increase in its activity (Figs.3 and 5) suggesting that basal levels of PGE2 increasethe number of the ATPase molecules but reduce theiractivity. Changes in the activity of the pump may be dueto its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [29] by someTNF-a-activated kinases/phosphatases like p38 MAPKand Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).In crypt cells, indomethacin had no effect on theprotein expressionof both transporters but still abrogatedNa+/K+/2Cl-\u03b2 actinControl PGE2 Fig. 13. Effect of PGE2 on the protein expression of the NaCeKCATPase in Caco-2 cells. Results are representative of an experimentthree times.the effect of TNF-a (Figs. 4 and 6c), inferring that PGE2 isnot involved in regulating the basal level of the twotransporters but is mediating only the induced down-regulatory effect of TNF-a.In both cells, the effect of TNF-a on NaCeKCATPase activity was more prominent than its effect onits protein expression and can be ascribed to a decreasein both the number and activity of pump molecules.In crypt cells the cotransporter was expressed athigher density (Fig. 6a and c), probably due to theknown greater role of crypt cells in secretion thansurface cells [30].It can be postulated that TNF-a decreases in vivoboth NaCand Cl\ufffdabsorption resulting in a net decreasein electrolyte uptake that causes changes in the osmoticgradient favoring more water retention in the colon.An inflammatory response is the result of a cytokinecascade,where one cytokine leads to the release of anotheruntil the final response is elicited. Thus TNF-a injected toanimals may have exerted its effect on the colonocytesdirectly or indirectly by acting on other target cells andcausing the release of other cytokines or inflammatorymediators that could act in an autocrine, parcrine orendocrine way. To clarify this point Caco-2 cells derivedfrom a human colon carcinoma cell line were culturedand grown in isolation from any other tissues, andtreated with TNF-a. These cells have been shown toretain cellular polarity, exhibit vectorial ion transport,form intercellular tight junction, and respond tohormones and neurotransmitters [31,32]. A Cl\ufffdsecre-tory response, although lower in intensity than the oneobserved in T84 or HT-19 cell lines, was elicited in thesecells by many secretagogues (cAMP, VIP, epineph-rine.) [32].TNF-a reduced in Caco-2 cells also, the activity andprotein expression of the NaCeKC pump (Figs. 7 and 8),which is consistent with our previous in vivo results.Indomethacin alone had no effect on the ATPase butabrogated the effect of TNF-a (Figs. 9 and 10). SinceCaco-2 cells are known to possess crypt cell properties[31], the effect of indomethacin on the pump was similarto that observed in crypt cells isolated from animalstreated in vivo with the cytokine.327S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327TNF-a had no effects on the protein expression of theNaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter in Caco-2 cells inpresence or absence of indomethacin (Fig. 11) while itreduced it significantly in crypt cells isolated fromtreated animals. Since the observed in vivo effectdisappeared in presence of indomethacin it is speculatedto be due to PGE2 produced by neighboring cells andacting in a paracrine way.The involvement of PGE2 in TNF-a action wasconfirmed by the direct addition of exogenous PGE2 toCaco-2 cells. PGE2 caused as TNF-a, a decrease in thepump activity and expression (Fig. 12) but had no effecton the NaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter (Fig. 13).It can be concluded that TNF-a decreases electrolyteabsorption by inhibiting the NaCeKC pump, andreduces electrolyte secretion by down-regulating theNaCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotranporter. The latter step maycome as a regulatory measure to counteract the reducedabsorption. The effect on absorption is probably moreprominent than the effect on secretion resulting in theobserved decrease in net Cl\ufffdand water uptake. Theeffect on the two transporters is mediated throughPGE2.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by a grant from theUniversity Research Board.References[1] Lauritsen K, Laursen LS, Bukhave K, Rask-Madsen.
