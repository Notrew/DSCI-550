Thisstudy determined the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the disc cells,with the aim to provide molecular mechanism support for the prevention and treatment of discdegeneration. Annulus fibrosus (AF) cells were isolated and cultured under serum starvation. 10 ng/mLTGF-b1 reduced the apoptosis incidence in the cells under serum starvation for 48 h, down-regulatedthe autophagy incidence in the cells pretreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin A (Baf A),partly rescued the increased apoptosis incidence in the cells pretreated with 3-MA, while further reducedthe decreased apoptosis incidence in the cells pretreated with Baf A. Meanwhile, TGF-b1 down-regulatedthe expressions of autophagic and apoptotic markers in the cells under starvation, partly down-regulated theexpressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the cells pretreated with 3-MA orBaf A, while significantly decreased the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 in the cells pretreated with Baf A.3-MA blocked the phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR and partly reduced the inhibitory effect ofTGF-b1 on the expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. TGF-b1 enhanced the expression ofp-ERK1/2 and down-regulated the expressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. U0126 partly reversedthis inhibitory effect of TGF-b1. In conclusion, TGF-b1 protected against apoptosis of AF cells understarvation through down-regulating excessive autophagy.

IntroductionIntervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) was recognized as themain cause for lower back pain [1\u20133], and IVDD did exist in 97%of individuals aged more than 50 years old in an autopsy study[4]. IVDD is definitely a consequence of aging. However, the under-lying molecular mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis ofIVDD has not been fully understood, although increased death ofthe intervertebral disc cells has been demonstrated to have anessential role in this process [5\u201310].Apoptosis and autophagy are two main programmed cell deathpatterns [11,12]. In addition to their importance as biologicalphenomena, defective apoptotic process or excessive autophagyhas been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases[10,13,14]. It was reported that increased apoptosis or excessiveautophagy in the intervertebral disc cells was also involved inthe pathogenesis of IVDD [11,15\u201317]. Meanwhile, apoptosis andautophagy were closely linked and autophagy could either inhibitor delay the occurrence of apoptosis [18\u201323], or promote apoptosis[24,25]. However, the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosisin the intervertebral disc cells and its implication in the pathogen-esis of IVDD has not been clarified.Studies have shown that transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1)was a critical factor in cartilage and spine tissue development[26,27]. It increased the proteoglycan synthesis in human interver-tebral discs [28], and decreased the intervertebral disc degenera-tion in rabbits [29]. Meanwhile, the effect of TGF-b1 on thecrosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in various types of cellshas also been studied with contradictory results [30\u201332]. TGF-b1could protect against mesangial cell apoptosis via induction ofautophagy [19], while it could induce autophagy and promotehttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249&domain=pdfhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249mailto:jiangleisheng@126.comhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine88 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells [33], bovine mammaryepithelial cell [34], and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells[32]. However, the role of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between apopto-sis and autophagy in the intervertebral disc cells has never beencomprehensively explored.Based on the background mentioned above, we believe thatunderstanding the molecular mechanisms involving the survivaland death of the intervertebral disc cells has important clinical sig-nificance in the prevention and treatment of degenerative disco-genic diseases. According to our previous study, intervertebraldisc cells underwent programmed cell death via different signaltransduction pathways in response to multiple stimuli [5]. In thisstudy, we used serum deprivation to induce programmed celldeath in the annulus fibrosus (AF) cells as previous described[35\u201337], observed the interactions between apoptosis andautophagy in the cells, and investigated the effect of TGF-b1 on thiscrosstalk. Because the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling path-ways were commonly involved in the regulation of autophagy, wehypothesized that TGF-b1 could protect against apoptosis throughinhibition of excessive autophagy in the AF cells under serum star-vation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.2. Materials and methods2.1. Isolation and culture of AF cellsTwenty-four Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats aged 2 months oldwere killed by an overdose intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloralhydrate (3.5 mL/kg). The AF tissue was obtained from L1\u2013L6 inter-vertebral discs under aseptic condition. Isolation and culture of theprimary-passage AF cells were carried out as previously described[35]. AF cells were collected and seeded into appropriate cultureplates maintained in a monolayer at a 37 \ufffdC, 5% CO2 environment,and the first-passage AF cells were used throughout the experi-ments. All experimental procedures were approved by the AnimalCare and Use Committee of our university, conformed to theinstitutional guidelines.2.2. Reagents and antibodiesRabbit monoclonal antibodies T-AKT, P-AKT, P-mTOR, T-mTOR,cleaved caspase-3, Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I, Bcl-2, T-ERK1/2 andP-ERK1/2 and rabbit polyclonal antibody Bax were purchased fromCell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA, USA). 3-Methyladenine(3-MA), acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine (MDC)were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). TheLyso-Tracker Kit, Lipofectamine-2000 transfection reagent, theAlexafluor 488-labeled and the Alexafluor 594-labeled secondaryantibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I was got from BD Pharm-ingen (San Diego, CA, USA). DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 was purchased fromGibco/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). TGF-b1 was purchased fromPeprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Hoechst 33258 and Bafilomycin Awere purchased from Biotime (Shanghai, China). GFP-LC3 plasmidwas kindly provided by Dr. Li Wang (Neonatology, Shanghai JiaoTong University).2.3. Transmission electronic microscopy for autophagosomesThe AF cells were cultured in DMEM with complete serumdeprivation for 24 and 48 h. Then the cells were separately fixedin 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,PH = 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature and postfixed in 1% osmiumtetroxide in water for 1 h, and stained in 2% uranyl acetate in waterfor 1 h in the dark. After dehydration in an ascending series ofethanol, the AF cells were embedded in Durcopan ACM for 6 h,cut into 80 nm sections. All these sections were stained with ura-nyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a transmissionelectron microscope (Philips CM, Netherlands). AF cells culturedin DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were servedas control.2.4. Detection of apoptotic cells by Hoechst 33258 stainingThe AF cells in starvation for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h were preparedat a density of 5000 cells per well in 24-well plates. Apoptotic cellswere detected by using the Hoechst 33258 (2 lg/mL) staining aspreviously described [36,38]. Morphologic changes in the apopto-tic nuclei were evaluated under a fluorescence microscope withexcitation wave length 350 nm, emission filter 460 nm (OlympusFluoview, Japan). A percentage was calculated by the strong bluestaining cells/total cells ratio \ufffd 100% in five random fields. AF cellscultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were served as control.2.5. Autophagy incidence quantified by flow cytometryThe first-passage AF cells were cultured in 6-well plates at2 \ufffd 105 cells per well with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After reach-ing 90% confluence, the medium was changed to DMEM containing1% FBS for 12 h to synchronize the cells and the cells were sub-jected to serum starvation. Autophagy incidence was measuredby quantifying the development of acidic vesicular organelles(AVOs) after AO staining (0.5 lg/mL) for 15 min at 37 \ufffdC [39],and immediately determined as percentage of AO positive cellsanalyzed with a FACS Canto II software (BD, USA).2.6. Measurement of apoptosis by flow cytometryThe apoptosis incidence of AF cells was detected by using theAnnexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (BDPharmingen) as previously described [35]. Apoptotic cells, includ-ing those staining positive for Annexin V-FITC and negative for PIand those double positive for Annexin V-FITC and PI, were countedand represented as a percentage of the total cell count.2.7. Real-time PCR analysisTotal RNA from the AF cells were extracted using RNAiso PlusKit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s proto-col. The purity and concentration of isolated RNA were measuredspectrophotometrically at OD260 and OD280. Complementary DNAwas synthesized from 1 lg of total RNA using the PrimeScript RTMaster Mix Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The gene expression ofBeclin-1, LC-3, and GAPDH was measured by real-time PCR usingthe Premix EX Taq Kit (Tli RnaseH Plus, TakaRa) and the ABI Prism7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City,CA, USA). The specific primers were designed and synthesizedcommercially (Takara, Dalian, China), and the sequences werelisted below:Beclin-1 (bp:154): forward, 50-GAAACTGGACACGAGCTTCAAGA-30; reverse, 50-ACCATCCTGGCGAGTTTCAATA-30 (Primer set ID:RA056559; GenBank Acc. NM 001034117.1).LC3 (bp:102): forward, 50-AGCTCTGAAGGCAACAGCAACA-30;reverse, 50-GCTCCATGCAGGTAGCAGGAA-30 (Primer set ID:RA019913; GenBank Acc. NM 022867.2).GAPDH (bp:143): forward, 50-GGCACAGTCAAGGCTGAGAATG-30; reverse, 50-ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTA-30 (Primer set ID: RA015380; GenBank Acc. NM 017008.3).The reaction mixture was amplified at 50 \ufffdC for 2 min and dena-tured at 95 \ufffdC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \ufffdC for 5 s and60 \ufffdC for 34 s. The optimal concentrations of primers and templatesB.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396 89used in each reaction were established according to the standardcurve created before the reaction. The fold change in all samplemRNA expressions was calculated by 2\ufffdDDC.2.8. Western blot analysisThe AF cells were treated according to the study protocol andharvested at indicated time points. 40 lg total protein fromdifferent samples were electrophoresed in different concentrations(6%, 10%, 12%) of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel andelectrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). After washing for three times with10 mM Tris-buffered saline with 1.0% Tween-20, the polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes were incubated with 5% dehydrated skimmilk to block nonspecific protein binding and then incubated withrabbit monoclonal antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (CST,#9964, 1:1000 dilution), Bcl-2 (CST, #2870, 1:2000 dilution),T-AKT (CST, #4691, 1:1000 dilution), Phospho-AKT (CST, #4060,1:1000 dilution), Beclin-1 (CST, #3495, 1:1000 dilution), LC3 II/I(CST, #3868, 1:500 dilution), T-mTOR (CST, #2983, 1:2000dilution), Phospho-mTOR (CST, #5536, 1:2000 dilution), T-P44/42MAPK\u2013ERK1/2 (CST, #4695, 1:1000 dilution), Phospho-P44/42MAPK\u2013ERK1/2 (CST, #4370, 1:1000 dilution), and rabbit polyclonalantibodies against Bax (CST, #2772, 1:1000 dilution) overnight at4 \ufffdC. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with horserad-ish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibod-ies (diluted 1:1000\u20131:2000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) andvisualized by the Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate system(Millipore or BeyoECL Plus). Protein band images were quantifiedby densitometry analysis using the Bio-Rad Image Lab 2.0 software(Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA, USA).2.9. Lysosomal activity detected by monodansylcadaverine and Lyso-Tracker stainingMonodansylcadaverine (MDC) is a marker for autolysosomes.After starvation for 48 h, AF cells with or without 10 ng/mLTGF-b1 were incubated with MDC (0.05 mM) for 10 min at 37 \ufffdC.Subsequently, the cells were washed four times with PBS and ana-lyzed by fluorescence microscopy (excitation wavelength 380 nm,emission filter 525 nm) (Olympus Fluoview, Japan). Lysosomalactivity was assessed by using the LysoTracker kit (Invitrogen,USA). After cultured at a density of 5000 cells per well, the starvedAF cells with or without TGF-b1 were incubated with LysoTrackerRed (100 nM) for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC and then observed using confocalmicroscopy (Olympus Fluoview, Japan). The cells cultured underserum condition were served as control groups.2.10. Immunofluorescence analysis for autophagy related proteinsAF cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at a density of 5000/per well with sterile glass cover slips as previous described [35].After serum deprivation for 48 h with or without 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, the AF cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washed three timeswith PBS, the AF cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100in PBS for 15 min and washed three times again in PBS, and thenblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at roomtemperature. The AF cells were then incubated with primary anti-bodies Beclin-1 (CST, #3495, 1:50 dilution) and LC3 II/I (CST,#3868, 1:30 dilution) respectively in 5% BSA overnight at 4 \ufffdC. Cellscultured under serum condition with isotype antibody were servedas control groups. Subsequently, the AF cells were washed in PBSfor three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 or AlexaFluor-594 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (dilution1:100) for 30 min at room temperature in dark. The cells were thenwashed three times with PBS and incubated with DAPI for 5 min.Finally, the cells were examined by a fluorescence microscopy(Olympus BX-FLA, Japan).2.11. GFP-LC3 plasmid transfection and autophagy assayAF cells were incubated at a density of 2 \ufffd 105 on 12-well platesand cultured up to 60% confluence. GFP-LC3 transfection was car-ried out with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019srecommendation. 2 mg/mL GFP-LC3 plasmid DNA in each dish wasused. After incubation in Opti-MEM medium for 6 h, the cells wereincubated in complete culture medium again for 24 h. Then thetransfected cells were treated with serum deprivation for 48 h withor without 10 ng/mL TGF-b1. Finally, the cells were fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde, and then washed twice in cold PBS. Autophagywas evaluated by analyzing the formation of fluorescent puncta ofautophagosomes in GFP-LC3 transfected cells under the fluores-cent microscope.2.12. Statistical analysisData were presented as means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) for atleast three independent experiments. Statistical analyses wereperformed by using the SPSS 13 statistical software program (SPSSInc., IL, USA). Multiple comparison of data among the groups weredetermined by the one-way ANOVA followed by the least significantdifference test (Fisher test) and the significance was evaluated bythe unpaired Student\u2019s test for comparisons between two means.A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. The evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells underserum deprivation and their interactionsAt first, the evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cellsunder serum deprivation were investigated. Autophagosomes,characterized as double-membrane vacuolar structures containingdifferent cytoplasmic fragment of damaged organelles oraggregate-prone proteins, could be detected under transmissionelectronic microscopy in the AF cells after starvation for 24 h, andcould be more easily found in the cells after starvation for 48 h(Fig. 1A). Hoechst 33258 staining demonstrated that apoptotic cellsbegan to be detectable after starvation for 24 h, and the number ofapoptotic cells increased further after starvation for 48 h (Fig. 1B).Then the autophagy incidence of the AF cells under serumdeprivation for various time periods (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h)was measured by quantifying the development of acidic vesicularorganelles (AVOs) after AO staining. Flow cytometric analysisrevealed that the autophagy incidence in AF cells maintained in arelatively low level (3.6%) when they were under DMEM cultiva-tion with serum in vitro. However, the autophagy incidence beganto increase in the cells after 12-h serum deprivation, furtherincreased steadily during 24\u201336 h, reached a peak value (29.9%)at 48 h, and then declined to 19.1% at 60 h (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,the protein and mRNA expressions of the biomarkers of autophagyand apoptosis were evaluated. Real-time PCR assay revealed thatthe mRNA expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 in the AF cells underserum deprivation began to increase at 12 h, reached their highestlevels at 48 h, and then decreased at 60 h (Fig. 1D). Western blotanalysis revealed similar results that the protein expressions ofBeclin-1 and LC3 II/I gradually increased when the cells were cul-tured under serum deprivation for 12\u201348 h and then decreasedat 60 h (Fig. 1E). However, the protein expression of cleaved cas-pase-3 remained at a low level in the cells under serum deprivationFig. 1. Evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation. AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation for 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h. (A)Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) for autophagosomes. Much more autophagosomes were detected in the AF cells after 48-h starvation. (B) Hoechst 33258 stainingfor apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells significantly increased with the time of serum deprivation. (C) Flow cytometric measurement for autophagy incidence. Theautophagy incidence increased gradually after 12 h, and reached the highest level (29.9%) at 48 h after serum starvation. (D) Real-time PCR analysis. The mRNA expressions ofBeclin-1 and LC3 increased steadily after starvation for 12\u201348 h, and then decreased gradually. (E) Western blot evaluation. The protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/Igradually increased in the cells under serum deprivation for 12\u201348 h and then gradually decreased. The protein expression of cleaved casepase-3 began to increase graduallyin the cells under serum starvation for 24 h. (F) Flow cytometric measurement for apoptosis incidence. The apoptosis incidence began to increase gradually in the cells after24 h of serum deprivation. For quantitative evaluations, the data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. AF cells cultured in serum were served as control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01versus control.90 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396for 12 h. Only after the cells were serum-starved for 24 h didcleaved caspase-3 begin to increase steadily in the cells (Fig. 1E).Meanwhile, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the levelof apoptosis incidence in AF cells under serum starvation graduallyincreased accordingly (Fig. 1F).These results suggested that serum deprivation could lead toboth autophagy and apoptosis in AF cells, and autophagy occurredearlier than apoptosis.Finally, the interactions between autophagy and apoptosis inthe AF cells under serum deprivation were investigated. Accordingto our results that the AF cells under serum deprivation had themost significant autophagy at 48 h (Fig. 1C\u2013E), we choose this timepoint in our next studies. The AF cells were pretreated with 5 mM3-MA (an actually autophagy stimulator in this study [40]), or100 nM Baf A (a widely used autophagy inhibitor), or vehicle(0.1% dimethylsulfoxide) for 2 h and cultured in serum-free DMEMfor 48 h. Flow cytometric measurements demonstrated that treat-ment with 3-MA definitely increased the autophagy incidence(Fig. 2A), while at the same time increased the apoptosis incidence(Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis also revealed that 3-MA increasedthe autophagic protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I(Fig. 2C), while at the same time increased the apoptotic proteinexpressions of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D). Theseresults suggested that excessive autophagy led to apoptosis inthe AF cells under serum starvation.Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by Baf A led to unex-pected increases of the autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) and theexpression of LC3 II/I (Fig. 2C), but had no effect on the proteinexpression of Beclin-1 (Fig. 2C). At the same time Baf A did reducethe apoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B), and the protein expression ofcleaved caspase-3, whereas actually increased the expression ofBax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D).3.2. The effect of TGF-b1 on autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cellsunder serum deprivationTo investigate the effect of TGF-b1 on autophagy and apoptosisin the AF cells under serum deprivation, cells were cultured inserum-free medium with various concentrations of TGF-b1 (5, 10and 20 ng/mL) for 48 h. The concentration range of TGF-b1 wasdecided according to previous studies which demonstrated that2\u201320 ng/mL TGF-b1 was efficient in various cell types [19,28,41].Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that TGF-b1 did not altereither the autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) or the apoptosis incidence(Fig. 2B) of AF cells under DMEM cultivation with 10% FBS. How-ever, the highest autophagy incidence in the AF cells under serumstarvation for 48 h decreased most significantly when 10 ng/mL ofTGF-b1 was added into the culture medium (Fig. 3A). At the sametime, 10 ng/mL of TGF-b1 also most significantly reduced theFig. 2. The interactions between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation. AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation for 48 h. (A) Flowcytometric measurements for the autophagy incidence. Both 3-MA and Baf A increased the autophagy incidence. TGF-b1 partly reversed the increased autophagy incidence inthe AF cells pretreated with 3-MA or Baf A. (B) Flow cytometric measurements for the apoptosis incidence. 3-MA increased, while Baf A decreased the apoptosis incidence.TGF-b1 significantly reduced the apoptosis incidence and partly reversed the increased apoptosis incidence in the AF cells pretreated with 3-MA, while further reduced thedecreased apoptosis incidence in the AF cells pretreated with Baf A. Western blot evaluation for the protein expressions of autophagic markers (C) and apoptotic markers (D).3-MA increased the expressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2, while Baf A decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, had no effect on Beclin-1,and actually increased the expressions of LC3II/I and Bax/Bcl-2. TGF-b1 significantly decreased the expressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the AF cellspretreated with 3-MA or Baf A. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. AF cells cultured with vehicle under serum deprivation for 48 h were served as control. *P < 0.05 versuscontrol, #P < 0.05 versus cells pretreated with the corresponding autophagy modulator.B.-B.

AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation with various concentrations ofTGF-b1 (5, 10, 20 ng/mL) for 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis for the autophagy incidence (A) and apoptosis incidence (B). 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 most significantly reduced theincreased autophagy and apoptosis incidences. (C) Western blot analysis. 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 significantly reduced the increased expressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I, cleavedcaspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2.

Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396apoptosis incidence in the AF cells under serum starvation for 48 h(Fig. 3B).Meanwhile, Western blot analysis showed that 10 ng/mL ofTGF-b1 significantly inhibited both the autophagic protein expres-sions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and the apoptotic protein expressions ofcleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 in the AF cells under starvation for48 h (Fig. 3C). Real-time PCR demonstrated similar results that10 ng/mL of TGF-b1 significantly inhibited the mRNA expressionsof Beclin-1 and LC3 in the AF cells under starvation for 48 h(Fig. 3D). In addition, immunofluorescence assay verified that10 ng/mL TGF-b1 significantly reduced the increased stainingintensities for lysosomes, autolysosomes and autophagy-relatedproteins in the AF cells under serum deprivation for 48 h. Autoph-agy assay in GFP-LC3 transfected cells also demonstrated thatserum deprivation increased the number of the GFP-LC3 punctategreen fluorescence in the cytoplasm, which could be reduced sig-nificantly by 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 (Fig. 4).3.3. TGF-b1 protected against apoptosis through inhibition of excessiveautophagy in AF cells under serum deprivationTo investigate the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk betweenautophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum starvation,AF cells were pre-treated with 3-MA (5 mM) or Baf A (100 nM)for 2 h, and cultured in serum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 for 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that TGF-b1 partlyreversed the increased autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) andapoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B) in the AF cells pre-treated with3-MA. Western blot analysis revealed that TGF-b1 down-regulated the increased protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3II/I (Fig. 2C), and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2D) in the AF cells pre-treated with 3-MA. Meanwhile, flow cytometric analysis revealedthat TGF-b1 reversed the elevated autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A)and further decreased the apoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B) whenthe cells were pre-treated with Baf A. Western blot analysis alsofound that when the AF cells were pre-treated with theautophagy inhibitor Baf A, the expressions of Beclin-1 andLC3-II/I (Fig. 2C), cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D) wereall down-regulated by TGF-b1.These results suggested that TGF-b1 could protect against apop-tosis through inhibition of excessive autophagy in the AF cellsunder serum starvation.3.4. TGF-b1 protected AF cells against apoptosis under serumdeprivation through PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathwaysTo explore whether the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signalingpathways were involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalkbetween autophagy and apoptosis, AF cells were pretreated with3-MA (an inhibitor of PI3K and p-AKT [42]), or with U0126 (aninhibitor of ERK1/2), and cultured in serum-free DMEM with10 ng/mL TGF-b1 for 48 h. Western blot analysis showed that theexpressions of p-AKT and p-mTOR were almost completely blockedby 3-MA, no matter whether TGF-b1 was administrated or not. Theexpressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the cells with bothTGF-b1 and 3-MA were lower than those with 3-MA alone,although not as low as those with TGF-b1 alone (Fig. 5A). Mean-while, TGF-b1 significantly enhanced the expression of phosphory-lated-ERK1/2. However, when U0126 was applied, the decreasedexpressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 by TGF-b1 was partlyup-regulated (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that the inhibitoryeffect of TGF-b1 on excessive autophagy could be weakened byeither 3-MA or U0126. Thus, both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2signaling pathways were involved in the actions of TGF-b1 onthe crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cellsunder serum deprivation.Fig. 4.

DiscussionAs in our previous study [35], the existence of autophagy andapoptosis was confirmed in the AF cells under serum starvationby the present study. Autophagy increased significantly in the cellsas early as 12 h after serum starvation and reached its highest levelat 48 h, while gradual increase of apoptosis happened only after24 h. When autophagy was moderately increased, apoptosis ofthe cells maintained at a low level. When autophagy was stimu-lated to an extremely high level, apoptosis of the cells increased.Thus, early and moderate autophagy was beneficial to the survivalof the AF cells, while late and excessive autophagy led to death ofthe AF cells. This inter-relationship between autophagy and apop-tosis in the AF cells was in accordance with most studies in othercell types [43,44].Autophagy and apoptosis are closely linked. Numerous studiesverified the existence of complicated crosstalk between apoptosisand autophagy in different cell types under different cultivationconditions [12,45,46]. Autophagy and apoptosis are two main pro-grammed cell death patterns, and both of them had an essentialrole in the process of IVDD [24,47]. Our findings about the interac-tions between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells would behelpful for better understanding the molecular mechanisms impli-cated in the pathogenesis of IVDD.Studies reported that TGF-b1 was involved in the regulationof autophagy and had pro-apoptosis [30,32,33,48] or anti-apoptosis[19] effect in various cell types. But, to our knowledge, there isno relevant research focusing on the effect of TGF-b1 on thecrosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the intervertebraldisc cells. Our present study demonstrated that 10 ng/mLTGF-b1 significantly decreased the enhanced autophagy andapoptosis caused by 48-h serum deprivation in the AF cells.However, when the excessive autophagy flux was further exacer-bated, the role of TGF-b1 to down-regulate apoptosis wasimpaired. When the excessive autophagy flux was suppressed,the role of TGF-b1 to down-regulate apoptosis was promoted.Thus, the above data suggested that TGF-b1 protected againstapoptosis through inhibition of excessive autophagy in the AFcells under serum starvation. Previous researches found thatthe expression of TGF-b1 was significantly up-regulated in theearly stage of disc degeneration [49], increased with thepathological grades of disc degeneration [50] and could delayintervertebral disc degeneration via regulating the extracellularmatrix production [51]. Thus, our findings about the effect ofTGF-b1 on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagyin the intervertebral disc cells should be helpful to betterunderstand the molecular mechanism for the involvement ofTGF-b1 in the process of disc degeneration.3-MA and Baf A were autophagy regulators commonly used innumerous studies for different kinds of cells. Consistent with pre-vious reports [19,52], Baf A actually increased the autophagy inci-dence and elevated the expression of LC3 II/I in our study, althoughFig. 5. TGF-b1 protected AF cells against apoptosis through inhibiting autophagy via PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. (A) Western blot for the expression ofT-AKT, p-AKT, T-mTOR, p-mTOR, and LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. Cells were cultured in complete serum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, or with 5 mM 3-MA, or withboth of these two for 48 h. 3-MA could evidently abrogate the TGF-b1 induced phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR and partly reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-b1 onthe expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. (B) Western blot for the expressions of T-ERK, p-ERK, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. AF cells were cultured in completeserum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, or with 10 lM U0126, or with both of these two for 48 h. TGF-b1 could significantly enhance the expression of p-ERK1/2 andsimultaneously inhibited the expressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. U0126 partly reversed this inhibitory effect of TGF-b1. AF cells pretreated with vehicles and thencultured under serum deprivation for 48 h were served as control. *P < 0.05 versus control, #P < 0.05 versus cells pretreated with the corresponding modulator.94 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396it is an autophagy inhibitor. The proper explanation was that Baf Ainhibited the fusion of autophagosomes/lysosomes and decreasedthe autophagic degradation, thus blocking the downstream stepin the autophagy flux. Thus, increased accumulation of autophago-somes led to increased autophagy incidence measured by flowcytometry for AO staining and elevated expression of LC3 II/Idetected by Western blot. Meanwhile, 3-MA was often used asan autophagy inhibitor by inhibiting the class III PI3K [42] andsuppressing autophagy [53]. However, we found that 3-MAactually promoted autophagy in AF cells under serum deprivationin vitro. Increased protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/Iand increased autophagy incidence were found in the AF cellspre-treated with3-MA. Although the accurate mechanism of 3-MA on promotingautophagy was not clear, a similar finding was reported that3-MA promoted autophagy because of its persistent inhibition onclass I PI3K, but transient suppression on class III PI3K [40].Its well known that apoptosis could be induced by variantupstream stimuli [54] and caspase-3 was a major proteaseexecuting apoptosis [55]. Cleaved caspase-3 could be activatedby cytochrome C released from mitochondria, which was pro-moted by Bax or inhibited by Bcl-2 [56\u201358]. Our results revealedthat both Baf A and 3-MA increased the expression of Bax/Bcl-2in the AF cells under serum deprivation. One possible reason wasthat autophagy was closely connected with the mitochondrialfunction [59\u201361], and inhibition of autophagy with Baf A led tothe unexpected high expression of Bax/Bcl-2. We also found thatTGF-b1 could down regulate the high expression of Bax/Bcl-2 inthe AF cells pretreated with Baf A, but not in the cells with3-MA. We speculated that TGF-b1 could re-establish the mitochon-drial function when the last step of autophagy was inhibited by BafA, but failed to re-establish the mitochondrial function when theautophagy was promoted by 3-MA. Furthermore, Baf A resultedin a decrease of cleaved caspase-3, although it did not reduceBax/Bcl-2 expression in our study, suggesting that Baf A reducedapoptosis via nonmitochondrial apoptotic pathway.These findings proved our hypothesis that TGF-b1 protected AFcells from apoptosis through down-regulating autophagy. Themitochondrial pathway might be involved in this process.Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was the key upstreamregulator of autophagy-related proteins [62]. Abundance ofnutrients, including growth factors, glucose, and amino acids acti-vate mTOR and suppress autophagy, whereas nutrient deprivationcould inhibit mTOR and promote autophagy [21,63]. PI3K/AKT layupstream of mTOR, and activated AKT inhibited autophagy throughactivating mTOR [64\u201366]. It has been reported that TGF-b1 couldactivate AKT in various cell types [19,67,68]. In our present study,we found that TGF-b1 significantly up-regulated the phosphoryla-tion of AKT and mTOR and down-regulated autophagy in the AFcells under serum deprivation. When the signaling pathwayPI3K/AKT/mTOR was blocked by 3-MA, TGF-b1 lost part of itsdown-regulating function on autophagy and apoptosis. These find-ings proved our hypothesis that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalingpathway was involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalkbetween autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serumdeprivation.B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396 95MAPK\u2013ERK is one of the mitochondrial signaling pathway and ithas been reported that the MAPK\u2013ERK signaling pathway couldregulate the expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes [69]and TGF-b1 could activate the phosphorylation of ERK [70,71]. Asexpected, our study further demonstrated that TGF-b1 could signif-icantly enhance the expression of phosphorylated-ERK1/2 andsimultaneously inhibited the expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved cas-pase-3. When the ERK signaling pathway was blocked with U0126,TGF-b1 lost part of its down-regulating function on autophagy.These results confirmed that the MAPK\u2013ERK1/2 signaling pathwaywas involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk betweenautophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation,which further confirmed that the impact of TGF-b1 was throughmitochondrial signaling pathway.We realized that there were several limitations in our presentstudy. Activation or inhibition of autophagy was through the useof chemical modulators in this study. The efficiency of these mod-ulators was not the best. Gene silencing or overexpression tech-nique would be better. The crosstalk between autophagy andapoptosis of the intervertebral disc cells under variant stress con-ditions and its significance in the pathogenesis of IVDD need tobe further investigated.5. ConclusionsThe current study demonstrated that TGF-b1 could protectagainst the apoptosis of AF cells under serum deprivation throughdown-regulating excessive autophagy. PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR andMAPK\u2013ERK1/2 were the possible signaling pathways involved inthis process. These findings should be helpful for us to betterunderstand the molecular mechanisms involved in the action ofTGF-b1 for AF cells and should be of clinical significance for theprevention and treatment of IVDD.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (81171757, 81000793) and funds from the Commis-sion of Science Technology of Shanghai (11JC1408500).References[1] Frymoyer JW, Cats-Baril WL.
