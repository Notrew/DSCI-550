In the current study the effect ofadiponectin on CCL2, -3, -4, and -5 and their corresponding receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 has beenanalyzed. Adiponectin elevates mRNA and protein of the CC chemokines in primary human monocytes.Simultaneously the surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 is reduced while CCR1 is not affected. Down-regulation of CCR2 by adiponectin is blocked by a CCR2 antagonist although expression of the CCL2 reg-ulated genes CCR2 and TGF-beta 1 is not altered in the adiponectin-incubated monocytes. CCL2, -3, and -5concentrations measured in supernatants of monocytes of normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), andtype 2 diabetic (T2D) patients positively correlate with BMI and are increased in obesity and T2D. In con-trast CCL4 is similarly abundant in the supernatants of all of these monocytes. The degree of adiponectin-mediated induction of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5 negatively correlates with their basal levels andupregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 is significantly impaired in OW and T2D cells. Serum concentrations ofthese chemokines are almost equal in the three groups and do not correlate with the levels in monocytesupernatants. In conclusion these data demonstrate that adiponectin stimulates release of CCL2 to CCL5in primary human monocytes, and induction in cells of overweight probands is partly impaired. Adipo-nectin also lowers surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CCR2 seems to depend onautocrine/paracrine effects of CCL2.\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionChemokines of the CC family attract mononuclear cells to sitesof inflammation [1]. CCL2 (Chemokine CC Motif Ligand 2, alsoknown as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, MCP-1) is themost extensively studied chemokine so far [1]. CCL2 deficiency isassociated with a higher susceptibility to infections and impairedimmune response [2,3]. However, concentrations of this chemo-kine are also increased in metabolic diseases and contribute to sys-temic and tissue inflammation [4]. In atherosclerotic lesions higherCCL2 production promotes infiltration of monocytes thereby accel-erating foam cell formation [5]. In obesity CCL2 attracts monocytesto fat tissues increasing local and systemic inflammation [6]. CCL2mRNA expression is also found induced in peripheral monocytes oftype 2 diabetic patients [7]. CCL2 is the ligand of the G-protein cou-pled receptor CCR2 whose expression is increased in monocytes ofhypercholesterolemic and type 2 diabetes patients [8,9]. Blockagell rights reserved.x: +49 941 944 7019.burg.de (C. Buechler).of CCR2 or CCR2 deficiency protects from obesity, inflammation,and insulin resistance in rodent models of obesity [6,10].The role of other CC chemokines including Macrophage Inflam-matory Protein (MIP)-1a (CCL3), MIP-1b (CCL4), and CCL5 (Regu-lated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed And Secreted,RANTES), and their corresponding receptors CCR1 (CCL3, CCL5)and CCR5 (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) has been less well characterizedin metabolic diseases [1]. These chemokines are all released bymonocytes and their synthesis is enhanced by lipopolysaccharidestimulation [11]. Systemic CCL5 is increased in serum of type 2 dia-betes patients [12]. Similar to CCL2 this chemokine enhances therecruitment of blood monocytes to adipose tissue. Furthermore,CCL5 protects adipose tissue resident macrophages from apoptosisthereby further elevating fat inflammation [13]. In contrast CCL3deficiency is not associated with altered accumulation of macro-phages in adipose tissue [14]. CCL4 has been mainly analyzed forits role in autoimmune diseases and it protects from insulitis [15].Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with immuno-regulatory, antidiabetic, and antiatherosclerotic properties[16,17]. Adiponectin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in activatedmonocytes and suppression of LPS-mediated IL-6 and CXCL8http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.017mailto:christa.buechler@klinik.uni-regensburg.dehttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.017http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666574 M. Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580synthesis has been shown [18,19]. In non-stimulated cells theseproteins are even induced by adiponectin suggesting an immuno-regulatory function of this adipokine [20,21]. Upregulation ofCCL2 by adiponectin has been demonstrated in cultured humanmicrovascular endothelial cells, colonic epithelial cells, and mono-cytes/macrophages [20\u201322]. Adiponectin mediated induction ofthis chemokine is even essential for the appropriate expressionof CCL2 in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection and im-mune defense [23].So far it has not been analysed whether chemokine receptorsare altered upon adiponectin incubation. Monocytes expressCCR1, CCR2, and CCR5, and mRNA expression is reduced uponLPS treatment [24]. LPS further induces internalisation and subse-quent degradation of CCR2 [25]. Short-term incubation of mono-cytes with CCL2 causes rapid CCR2 internalization but prolongedincubation with this chemokine induces CCR2 expression [26,27].Therefore, it may be speculated that at least abundance of CCR2is altered in adiponectin-treated monocytes because of paracrine/autocrine effects due to increased CCL2 concentrations.In the current study it was analysed whether adiponectin regu-lates CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 and their corresponding receptorsCCR1, -2, and -5 in primary human monocytes.2. Materials and methods2.1. SubjectsThe study protocol was approved by the local ethics committeeand the investigation conforms with the principles outlined in theDeclaration of Helsinki (1997). Each proband gave written in-formed consent to participate in the study.Monocytes were isolated from the blood of 11 male T2D pa-tients, 12 male controls with a BMI > 25 kg/m2 (overweight controlgroup, OW) and 10 male controls with a BMI 6 25 kg/m2 (normal-weight controls, NW). T2D patients were treated with drugs likemetformin. Further two patients were treated with ACE inhibitors,one patient with lipid lowering drugs, and two patients with b-blockers. In the OW group one patient was treated with lipid low-ering drugs. In the NW group one patient got ACE inhibitors andone patient was treated with lipid lowering drugs. The characteris-tics of the study group are summarized in Table 1. This cohort in-cludes patient samples of recently described study groups [28,29].2.2. MaterialRecombinant human adiponectin expressed in a mammaliancell line, CCL2-, CCL3-, CCL4-, and CCL5 ELISAs were from R&D Sys-tems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany).

Immunoblot analysis wasdone using antibodies for CCR1, -2 and -5 from Biozol (Eching, Ger-many). Anti-mouse PE-conjugated IgG antibody was from DAKO(Glostrup, Denmark). CCR2 antagonist RS-102895 was from SigmaBioscience (Deisenhofen, Germany) and 20 lM were used.2.3. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNAMaster SYBR Green I from Roche (Mannheim, Germany) as describedelsewhere [21,30]. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2. Datawere normalized to b-actin mRNA levels. The specificity of the PCRswas confirmed by sequencing of the PCR fragments (Geneart,Regensburg, Germany).2.4. Isolation and culture of primary blood monocytesPeripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from 40 ml of wholeblood using Vacutainer CPT systems (Becton Dickinson, FranklinLakes, NJ) as described [31]. Primary human monocytes were puri-fied by magnetic separation with CD14 beads (Miltenyi Biotec,Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Serum was coagulated with Throm-borel S (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and CaCl2 (Calbiochem-Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and was dialyzed two times againstphosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h each. Flow cytometry anal-ysis revealed that about 95% of the isolated cells were monocytes[31]. 3 \ufffd 106 monocytes were cultivated in 3 ml RPMI supple-mented with 10% autologous serum for 24 h. Subsequently, themedium was replaced with 1 ml fresh medium. For adiponectinstimulation monocytes were incubated for 24 h with 10 lg/mladiponectin until indicated otherwise. Cells and supernatants werecollected 24 h later and used for ELISA and western blot analysis.2.5. ElisaELISAs were performed as recommended by the distributor.Supernatants were diluted 10-fold to measure CCL2, 4-fold to mea-sure CCL3, 2-fold to measure CCL4, and 5-fold to measure CCL5.CCL5 serum levels are in the ng/ml range and concentrations addedto the monocyte culture medium were subtracted before perform-ing calculations. Serum was used undiluted for CCL2 and CCL4determinations, 2-fold diluted for CCL3 and 100-fold diluted forCCL5 determinations.2.6. ImmunoblotCells were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysisbuffer.

Incubations with antibodies (dilution 1:1000)were performed in 1.5% BSA in PBS and 0.1% Tween overnight.Detection of the immune complexes was carried out with the en-hanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amer-sham Pharmacia, Deisenhofen, Germany). Quantification was doneusing Optiquant software.2.7. Flow cytometryMonocytes of four (CCR1 measurement) to six (CCR2 and CCR5analysis) different donors were isolated and 5 \ufffd 106 cells were cul-tivated on petriPERM dishes (Sarstedt, N\u00fcrnbrecht, Germany) for24 h as described above. Medium was replaced and cells wereincubated with or without recombinant adiponectin (10 lg/ml)for 24 h. For cell removal, petriPERM dishes were placed on a coldmetal block for 10 min and cells were collected in cold PBS. Aftercentrifugation, cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 25 lg/mlCCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 antibody or the respective isotypes, IgG1 (iso-type for CCR2 and CCR5 antibodies) and IgG2b (isotype for CCR1antibodies). Following, cells were washed with cold PBS, resus-pended in 100 ll ice-cold PBS and incubated with anti-mouseR0439 PE-conjugated antibody (1:50-fold diluted) for 45 min onice in the dark. Subsequently cells were washed with ice-coldFig. 1.

Data in Fig. 1 are shown asmean \u00b1 standard error of the mean because data of only two differ-ent experiments using monocytes of two donors are shown. Statis-tical differences were analyzed by two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney UTest or Students\u0301 t-test for paired samples and a value of p < 0.05was regarded as significant. The Spearman-Rho correlation wascalculated using the PASW Statistics 17.0 software.3. Results3.1. Adiponectin upregulates chemokine mRNA and protein in humanmonocytesMonocytes were isolated from the blood of two normal-weightdonors and were incubated with different concentrations of adipo-nectin for 24 h. Release of CCL2, -3, -4 and -5 was dose-depen-dently increased when 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 lg/ml adiponectinwere used (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Higher concentrations of 12.5 and 15 lg/ml did not further elevate CCL3 and CCL4 whereas CCL2 andCCL5 even tended to be decreased (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Therefore, 10 lg/ml adiponectin was used for further studies.Chemokines were measured in the supernatants of monocytesisolated from the blood of eight normal-weight donors and subse-quently cultivated with or without 10 lg/ml adiponectin for 24 h.CCL3, -4, and -5 were all significantly increased in the supernatantsof adiponectin-treated cells (Fig. 2B\u2013D), as well as CCL2 which hasalready been described to be induced by adiponectin [17]) CCL2, (B) CCL3, (C) CCL4, and (D) CCL5 in the supernatants of monocytes incubatedo independent experiments are shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean.Fig. 2.

CCL3 was significantly more induced than CCL2 and CCL5and tended to be more efficiently upregulated compared to CCL4whereas the effect of adiponectin on CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 was sim-ilar (Fig. 2E). The mRNA expression of these chemokines was ana-lysed by real-time RT-PCR in monocytes isolated from the bloodof five different donors and was found significantly enhanced inthe adiponectin-incubated cells (p = 0.034 for CCL2, p = 0.017 forCCL3, p = 0.026 for CCL4 and p = 0.030 for CCL5). The effect onCCL3 mRNA levels was higher compared to CCL5 induction (Fig. 2F).3.2. Adiponectin lowers abundance of chemokine receptors on the cellsurfaceSurface abundance of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 was analysed byflow cytometry and representative results are shown in Fig. 3A.In monocytes of four different donors incubated with adiponectinfor 24 h surface levels of CCR1 were not altered (Fig. 3B). CCR2and CCR5 were significantly reduced when monocytes of six differ-ent donors were analysed and CCR2 was significantly more sup-pressed than CCR5 (Fig. 3B). When monocytes of three differentdonors were preincubated with the CCR2 receptor antagonist RS-102895 for 2 h adiponectin-mediated downregulation of CCR2was abrogated (Fig. 3C). Further, this antagonist significantly re-duced surface CCR2 abundance (Fig. 3C). Chemokine receptor pro-tein was analysed in the cell lysates of monocytes of 10 donors(Fig. 3D and data not shown) and were not reduced upon adiponec-tin incubation (Fig. 3E). Chemokine receptor mRNA expression wasdetermined in monocytes of eight different donors and was notsignificantly changed (Fig. 3F).3.3. Chemokine levels in cells of normal-weight, overweight, and type2 diabetes patientsChemokine levels were also measured in the supernatants ofmonocytes isolated from the blood of normal-weight controls(NW, 10 donors), overweight donors (OW, 12 donors), and T2D pa-tients (11 donors) (Table 1). The levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5were all increased in cells of OW and T2D probands compared toNW (Fig. 4A, B and D). CCL5 was even higher in the supernatantsof T2D compared to OW cells (Fig. 4D). CCL4, however, was simi-larly concentrated in the supernatants of all of these cells(Fig. 4C). Because chemokine levels were highly variable thelog(10) levels were used for further calculations and a positive cor-relation of logCCL2 (r = 0.576, p < 0.001), logCCL3 (r = 0.578,p = 0.001) and logCCL5 (r = 0.686, p < 0.001) but not logCCL4(r = 0.217, p = 0.225) with BMI was identified (Fig. 4E\u2013H). Further-more, levels of all chemokine were correlated to each other evenwhen adjusted for BMI (Table 3) but not to systemic adiponectinconcentrations (data not shown).3.4. Effect of adiponectin on chemokine levels in cells of normal-weight, overweight, and type 2 diabetes patientsThe effect of adiponectin to induce these chemokines was alsotested. Here, induction of CCL3 and CCL5 was significantly impairedin monocytes of OW compared to NW donors (p = 0.009 for CCL3and p = 0.036 for CCL5) and in cells of T2D compared to NW mono-cytes (p < 0.001 for CCL3 and p = 0.006 for CCL5). Adiponectin-med-iated upregulation of the chemokines was similar in OW and T2Dmonocytes (Fig. 5A and B). The degrees of adiponectin-inducedupregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 showed a strong negative correlationto BMI (r = \ufffd0.599, p < 0.001 for CCL3 and r = \ufffd0.399, p = 0.021 forCCL5) and were positively correlated to each other (r = 0.668,p < 0.001) suggesting that similar regulatory pathways are involved(Fig. 5C and data not shown). The latter association was even highlysignificant after adjusting for BMI (r = 0.638, p < 0.001). The degreeof adiponectin-induced upregulation of CCL4 was negatively associ-ated with basal logCCL4 levels (r = \ufffd0.720, p < 0.001, Fig. 5D).Upregulation of CCL2 by adiponectin was neither associated withits basal levels nor BMI of the blood donors.Fig. 3.

Chemokine levels in serum of normal-weight, overweight, andtype 2 diabetes patientsChemokines measured in the serum of these probands (Table 1)did not correlate with concentrations in the supernatants of therespective monocytes (data not shown). Systemic levels of CCL2,CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 did not correlate with age, BMI, waist tohip ratio, serum adiponectin or fasting glucose of the patients.There was a modest positive correlation of systemic CCL3 andCCL5 (r = 0.386, p = 0.026).4. DiscussionIn the current study we confirmed previous data showing thatadiponectin upregulates CCL2 in primary human monocytes[20,32]. Further, induction of CCL2 mRNA is demonstrated suggest-ing that transcriptional mechanisms are involved. Besides CCL2,the mRNA and protein levels of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5are also significantly induced by adiponectin. CCL2 is the ligandof CCR2, CCL3 and CCL5 are ligands of CCR1 whereas CCL3, CCL4,and CCL5 bind to CCR5 [1]. Neither mRNA nor total protein levelsof these receptors are altered by adiponectin incubation. However,surface abundance of CCR2 is about 4-fold reduced and CCR5 isabout 2-fold lower in adiponectin incubated cells. CCR1 surfacelevels are not reduced by adiponectin. Lower surface levels of atleast CCR2 seem to be secondary effects of ligand binding becauseits downregulation by adiponectin is completely blocked by a CCR2antagonist. Reduced numbers of cell-surface localized chemokinereceptors may desensitize those cells for further chemokine-asso-ciated signaling events. Interestingly this antagonist significantlylowers CCR2 surface levels in control- and adiponectin-incubatedcells.Recently it has been shown that CCL2 upregulates CCR2 andTGF-beta 1 mRNA in monocytes [27] but neither CCR2 nor TGF-beta 1 (own unpublished data) expression are increased in theadiponectin incubated cells. Cells studied herein were incubatedfor 24 h with adiponectin whereas Sakai et al. mainly analysedmonocytes which were cultivated with CCL2 for 48 h, and shorterincubation time used herein may partly explain these differentfindings.Although adiponectin levels have been found reduced in obesityand metabolic syndrome [33,34] systemic concentration are similarin the cohort analysed herein. Recent work has demonstrated high-er adiponectin in patients with impaired renal function and adipo-nectin has been identified to even predict an increased risk forcoronary heart disease [35,36]. Therefore, adiponectin levels are af-fected by renal dysfunction and coronary heart disease and some ofthe probands studied herein may have suffered from these compli-cations. Further, the cohorts studied may have been too small todemonstrate lower adiponectin in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Adiponectin concentrations used in the in vitro studies hereinare four- to five-fold higher compared to median systemic levelsof the study cohort analysed. Dose\u2013response curves demonstratea maximal effect when 10 lg/ml recombinant adiponectin is used.When analysing primary cells varying basal chemokine levels anddistinct responses to adiponectin are expected. This led us to useFig. 4. CCL2 to -5 in the supernatants of monocytes isolated from the blood of type 2 diabetic patients (T2D), overweight (OW) and normal weight controls (NW).

Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580the most effective concentration of adiponectin to assure that thecells of all donors respond to this adipokine. Several studies haveshown that effects of adiponectin are impaired in obesity and type2 diabetes [30,37\u201340] and higher adipokine concentrations may benecessary to stimulate the cells.Impaired adiponectin-mediated upregulation of CCL3 and CCL5is also detected in T2D and OW cells compared to NW monocytes.The induction of CCL3 and CCL5 by adiponectin shows a strong po-sitive correlation to each other and is even negatively associatedwith BMI of the respective blood donors. These findings suggestthat monocyte CCL3 and CCL5 synthesis are similarly regulatedby adiponectin and this pathway is partly blocked by factors af-fected in cells of overweight and obese blood donors. In addition,a positive correlation of CCL3 and CCL5 levels is also found in themonocyte supernatants and in serum of the blood donors.CCL2 and CCL4 are similarly induced by adiponectin in themonocytes of NW, OW and T2D patients. Whereas the inductionof CCL2 by adiponectin is not related to its basal levels or BMI ofthe donors, a strong negative correlation of basal CCL4 and adipo-nectin mediated upregulation of CCL4 independent of BMI hasbeen identified. This might indicate that monocytes with a higherbasal release of CCL4 are more resistant to adiponectin-mediatedupregulation of CCL4. However, neither the exact pathways in-volved in adiponectin-induced chemokine induction nor the rea-son for higher basal monocyte CCL4 synthesis have beenanalysed so far and future studies are needed to evaluate theunderlying mechanisms.The data discussed above indicate that different signal trans-duction pathways are involved in the upregulation of the chemo-kines studied herein. Furthermore, these data demonstrate thatthere is no general resistance to adiponectin effects in state ofobesity or type 2 diabetes. In fact only specific signal transductionpathways seem to be affected. Similar results have recently beenobtained in fat-loaded hepatocytes where only certain actions ofadiponectin are blocked [41].Adiponectin binds to different receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2,which are both expressed in monocytes [30,42] and signaling ofFig. 5.

Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580 579just one pathway may be disturbed in obesity. Various adiponectinreceptor downstream effectors including p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AMP-activated protein kinase and NFjB have been identified [42\u201344]and activity of specific molecules may be differentially affectedin obesity.Recently we described that LPS-induced release of these chemo-kines is similar in monocytes of controls and T2D patients [11] sug-gesting that anthropometrical and disease-related factors affectonly some pathways as described for adiponectin herein.Basal levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 are all increased in thesupernatants of OW and T2D monocytes indicating that highersynthesis is related to BMI and not to type 2 diabetes. Interestingly,levels of these chemokines in the supernatants of the monocytescorrelates positively with BMI of the blood donors. CCL4, however,is similarly abundant in all of the supernatants and not associatedwith BMI.None other than CCL5 is modestly higher in T2D cells comparedto monocytes of BMI-matched controls. CCL5 at least in serum hasbeen suggested to be involved in the development of T2D indepen-dent of classical risk factors like BMI and dyslipidemia [12]. Low-dose insulin infusion in T2D significantly reduces mononuclear cellCCL5 but not CCL2 expression suggesting that impaired insulinactivity may contribute to increased monocyte CCL5 in T2D pa-tients [45]. CCL5 and CCL2 serum levels are reduced upon insulininfusion indicating that at least systemic CCL2 is not influencedby its synthesis in mononuclear cells [45].Levels of CCL2 and CCL5 have been found increased in serum oftype 2 diabetes patients when analyzing rather large cohorts[9,12], and the low number of patient samples studied hereinmay explain why this increase has not been confirmed. Further,chemokines in serum do not correlate with the respective chemo-kines in the monocyte supernatants. The chemokines analysedherein are synthesized by various cells and tissues [46\u201348], andtherefore, it is unlikely that monocyte released protein consider-ably affect systemic levels.In summary this study shows that adiponectin stimulates syn-thesis of CCL2 to CCL5 in primary human monocytes, and releaseof CCL3 and -5 is impaired in obesity. Surface abundance of CCR2and -5 is reduced in adiponectin-incubated monocytes suggestingthat this adipokine regulates CC-chemokine activity at the ligandand receptor level.Duality of interest statementThe authors declare that there is no duality of interest associ-ated with this manuscript.Author contributionsStudy concept and design: CB, HB, AS.
