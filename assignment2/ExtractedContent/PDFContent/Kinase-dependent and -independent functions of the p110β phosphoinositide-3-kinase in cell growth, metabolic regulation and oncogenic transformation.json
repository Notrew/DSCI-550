Recent studies have demonstrated specific roles for p110\u03b1 in growth factorand insulin signaling6\u20138. To probe for distinct functions of p110\u03b2, we constructed conditionalknockout mice. Ablation of p110\u03b2 in the livers of the resulting mice led to impaired insulin sensitivityand glucose homeostasis, while having little effect on Akt-phosphorylation, suggesting involvementof a kinase-independent role of p110\u03b2 in insulin metabolic action. Using established mouseembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we found that removal of p110\u03b2 also had little effect on Akt-phosphorylation in response to insulin and EGF stimulation, but resulted in retarded cell proliferation.Reconstitution of p110\u03b2-null cells with a wild-type or kinase-dead allele of p110\u03b2 demonstrated thatp110\u03b2 possesses kinase-independent functions in regulating cell proliferation and trafficking.However, the kinase activity of p110\u03b2 was required for LPA triggered GPCR signalling and playeda role in oncogenic transformation. Most strikingly, in an animal model of prostate tumor formationinduced by PTEN loss, ablation of p110\u03b2, but not p110\u03b1, impeded tumorigenesis with concomitantdiminution of Akt-phosphorylation. Taken together our findings demonstrate both kinase-dependentand -independent functions for p110\u03b2, and strongly point to the kinase-dependent functions ofp110\u03b2 as a promising target in cancer therapy.Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases consisting of a p110 catalytic subunitcomplexed to one of several regulatory subunits, collectively called p854, 5. In response togrowth factor stimulation, p110 subunits catalyze the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to T.M.R (thomas_roberts@dfci.harvard.edu) or J.J.Z(jean_zhao@dfci.harvard.edu).*These authors contributed equally to this work.Author Contributions Z.L., S.Z. and S.L. generated the floxed p110\u03b2 mouse; S.J. carried out mouse tumorigenesis studies; Z.L andS.Z. performed MEF studies; P.L. performed in vivo metabolic studies; L.Z. performed transferrin uptake assays; J.Z. assisted in focusformation and BrdU incorporation experiments; S.S., and M.L. performed and interpreted pathological analyses of mouse prostate tumors;T.M.R. and J.J.Z. supervised the research, interpreted the data and wrote the paper; S.J., Z.L., S.Z., P.L., L.Z., S.L. and M.L. participatedin the writing of the paper.Author Information Reprints and permissions information is available at www.nature.com/reprints.The authors declare no competing financial interests.NIH Public AccessAuthor ManuscriptNature.

The lipid second messenger PIP3 in turn activatesthe serine/threonine kinase Akt and other downstream effectors 9, 10. Knockout mice for eitherp110\u03b1 or p110\u03b2 die early in embryonic development11, 12. However, recent studies usingconditional knockout strategies8 and via isoform-specific small molecule inhibitors7demonstrated that p110\u03b1 plays an important role in growth factor signalling, while a kinase-inactive knockin mouse model showed that insulin responses depended on the catalytic activityof p110\u03b16.To investigate the role(s) of p110\u03b2 in cell, tissue and organismal physiology and to examineit as a potential therapeutic target in cancer, we generated mice carrying a conditionalPIK3CB allele (Supplementary Fig. 1). We first investigated the role of p110\u03b2 in insulin action.Since liver is the major insulin responsive organ, we examined the effects of p110\u03b2 loss onhepatic insulin function. To achieve liver-specific deletion of p110\u03b2, we injected the tail veinsof p110\u03b2flox/flox mice with adenoviruses expressing \u03b2-galactosidase (Ade-LacZ) or Crerecombinase (Ade-Cre) to generate matched cohorts of control mice and mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of p110\u03b2. Additional cohorts of wildtype animals were subjected to Ade-Creor Ade \u2013LacZ, allowing us to rule out potential non-specific Cre effects (data not shown).Greater than 90% reduction of p110\u03b2 protein was seen in the livers of Ade-Cre injected mice,while p110\u03b2 expression remained unchanged in the livers of the control mice and muscle tissuesfrom both groups as measured by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2a and b). Consistentwith previous findings6, 7 that the kinase activity of p110\u03b2 plays only a minor role in insulinsignaling, we saw no significant change in Akt-phosphorylation in response to insulinchallenge in livers lacking p110\u03b2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). However, mice deficient in hepaticp110\u03b2 displayed higher blood insulin levels than control animals when fasted (Fig. 1a). Theseanimals also exhibited reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity upon challenge byintraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin (Fig. 1b and c). Mice deficient in hepaticp110\u03b2 produced more glucose than control animals in a pyruvate challenge test (Fig. 1d). Ananalysis of lipogenesis showed no significant changes in serum triglycerides, fatty acids andcholesterol levels when p110\u03b2 was deleted from liver (Supplementary Fig. 3), but leptin levelswere elevated compared with control animals, as was seen in p110\u03b1 kinase-dead knockinanimals 6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of a panel of gluconeogenic genes, onlyphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was increased in p110\u03b2 deficient livers(Supplementary Fig. 4). PEPCK promotes glucose production and synthesis in liver, resultingin more glucose release into blood. Therefore, this data provides at least a partial explanationfor the metabolic phenotypes observed. While these findings suggest that p110\u03b2 mightcontribute to metabolic regulation via a kinase-independent mechanism, we cannot rule outthe involvement of p110\u03b2\u2019s catalytic role in insulin responses. Our observations are in linewith the earlier work by Knight et al7, who used a p110\u03b2-specific small molecule inhibitor todemonstrate that acute blockage of p110\u03b2\u2019s kinase activity had little effect on insulin action.In addition, the Cantley lab found that mice doubly heterozygous for knockout of p110\u03b1 andp110\u03b2 showed reduced insulin sensitivity with no apparent changes in Akt-phosphorylation13.To obtain cells for detailed signalling studies, MEFs were isolated from floxed embryos andtheir wild-type littermates, as described in the supplementary information (Supplementary Fig.5a, b and c). MEFs lacking p110\u03b2 proliferated significantly slower than parental(p110\u03b2flox/flox) or wild-type (p110\u03b2+/+ after Cre) MEFs (Fig. 2a). To obtain a second, moreeasily renewed supply of knockout cells, we established immortalized p110\u03b2flox/flox andp110\u03b2+/+ MEFs via infection with a retrovirus encoding a dominant negative form of p53(DNp53)14. We also generated an add-back line by introducing HA-tagged human p110\u03b2 toDNp53-immortalized p110\u03b2flox/flox MEFs. These immortalized MEFs were then treated withAde-Cre to yield the following MEF lines: \u03b2KO (from p110\u03b2flox/flox) and \u03b2KO+\u03b2 (from theadd-back). For wild-type control MEFs, designated WT in the figures, we used DNp53-Jia et al. Page 2Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 September 24.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptimmortalized p110\u03b2flox/flox cells without Cre treatment or Cre-treated DNp53-immortalizedp110\u03b2+/+ MEFs interchangeably, as no significant differences were ever seen between thesetwo possible controls. Deletion of p110\u03b2 had no obvious negative effect on the Akt-phosphorylation in either primary MEFs or DNp53-immortalized MEFs in response to insulin,EGF and PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b and c). However, a moderatediminution on the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) at Ser235/236 wasdetected in these \u03b2KO cells in response to insulin or serum (Supplementary Fig. 7). Previousstudies have implicated p110\u03b2 in signalling elicited by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)15, 16. Consistently, we found that both phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP levels were reducedin response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in cells lacking p110\u03b2 (Fig. 2d and SupplementaryFig. 8a).To dissect the potential kinase-dependent and -independent roles of p110\u03b2, we reconstituted\u03b2KO MEFs with a kinase-inactive allele of HA-tagged human p110\u03b2, using the previouslyreported K805R mutation (KR)17 to generate the \u03b2KO+KR MEF line. Though the KRexpression was lower than that of the WT add-back construct, it was expressed at a level slightlyhigher than endogenous p110\u03b2, and expression levels of p110\u03b1 were unchanged(Supplementary Fig.9a and data not shown). Loss of lipid kinase activity in the KR cells wasconfirmed by lipid kinase assay8, 18 following anti-p110\u03b2 immuno-precipitation(Supplementary Fig.9b). We then examined the effect of WT or KR add-back on the alteredsignalling seen upon loss of p110\u03b2. The reduction in both phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP inresponse to LPA stimulation observed in \u03b2KO cells was restored by adding back WT but notthe KR allele of p110\u03b2 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8b), suggesting a catalytic functionfor p110\u03b2 in LPA signalling. This appears to be unique to p110\u03b2 as p110\u03b1 loss has no obviouseffect on LPA signalling (Fig. 2e). Intriguingly, the reduced phospho-S6RP levels in \u03b2KO cellswere restored by both WT and KR add-backs in response to insulin or FBS (SupplementaryFig. 7 and data not shown), suggesting a scaffolding role of p110\u03b2 in insulin and growth factorsignalling. However, our MEF data does not rule out a role for p110\u03b2 in classical PI3Ksignalling in other circumstances. For instance, when we ablated p110\u03b1 in our earlier work,residual Akt-phosphorylation was observed in response to growth factors8. Since MEFsexpress p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 and not other Class I PI3Ks, this residual signal was presumablytransduced by p110\u03b2. We also note that p110\u03b2 ablation removes it as a competitor for p110\u03b1on receptors, which may allow any reduction in signalling caused by p110\u03b2 loss to be maskedor compensated by increased signal flux via p110\u03b1.To test the kinase-dependent and/or -independent effects of p110\u03b2 on cell proliferation, westudied cell cycle kinetics by first synchronizing cells by serum starvation and then measuringthe proportion of cells in S-phase with BrdU incorporation following re-feeding. While \u03b2KOcells had a delayed peak of BrdU incorporation, KR reconstituted cells showed similar BrdUincorporation to that of WT and \u03b2KO+ \u03b2 cells (Fig. 2f). Consistently, \u03b2KO+KR MEFs showedproliferation rates similar to WT and \u03b2KO+\u03b2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c), suggesting akinase-independent role of p110\u03b2 in cell proliferation.Since previous studies have found p110\u03b2 associated with members of the Rab family of smallG proteins and clathrin coated vesicles19, we measured transferrin uptake in \u03b2KO MEFs andfound it to be defective compared to WT and \u03b2KO+ \u03b2 MEFs (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, normaltransferrin uptake was restored by the KR construct (Fig. 2g). While there is ample literatureevidence pointing to the importance of transferrin uptake for the growth of a variety of celltypes20, it is not clear whether the transferrin uptake defect is a primary cause of the growthdefect observed here.Class IA PI3Ks have been clearly implicated in cancer21\u201324, with much recent work delineatingthe role of p110\u03b1 in cancer25\u201327. To study a potential role of p110\u03b2 in oncogenicJia et al. Page 3Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 September 24.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscripttransformation, we carried out focus formation assays by infecting monolayers of DNp53-immortalized MEFs with retroviruses expressing various oncogenes. Oncogenic HRas-G12Vand EGFR-Del (\u0394L747-E749, A750P) efficiently raised foci in WT cells, but failed totransform \u03b2KO MEFs (Fig. 3a). The decreases in foci seen in \u03b2KO MEFs were actually morepronounced than those seen in p110\u03b1 KO MEFS (Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably,transformation was fully restored in \u03b2KO+\u03b2 cells but partially restored in \u03b2KO+KR cells (Fig.3a), suggesting that both the kinase activity and kinase-independent functions of p110\u03b2 mayplay a role in oncogene-induced transformation.PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, functions to oppose class IA PI3K kinase activity. Loss of PTENexpression is a common event in many solid tumors28. The key challenge is to identify whichp110 isoform\u2019s catalytic activity is unshackled by PTEN loss in any given tumor. To test fora role of p110\u03b2 in tumorigenesis driven by PTEN loss, we generated mice that carried thePTENflox/flox29 and p110\u03b2flox/flox alleles, as well as a probasin-driven Cre transgene30, tospecifically delete PTEN and p110\u03b2 in prostatic epithelium. Prostates appeared normal in theabsence of p110\u03b2 (Fig. 3b and c). Prostate tissue lacking PTEN expression displayed universalhigh-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) in the anterior lobe by 12 weeks.Remarkably, ablation of p110\u03b2 blocked tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss in the anteriorprostate (Table 1; Fig. 3b and c). The loss of PTEN was confirmed by genomic DNA analysisfollowing laser-capture assisted microdissection of single epithelial layers and by westernblotting (Supplementary Fig. 11 and data not shown). While Cre-mediated loss of PTENefficiently activated Akt in the prostate as judged by its phosphorylation on Ser473, additionalablation of p110\u03b2 diminished the phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 3b), suggesting that p110\u03b2 catalyticactivity contributes to tumorigenesis. More surprisingly, when we performed the same set ofexperiments using p110\u03b1 ablation, we saw no changes either in tumor formation or in Akt-phosphorylation (Table 1; Figure 3b and c). Again, the complete excision of p110\u03b1 in tumortissues was confirmed by multiple measures (Supplementary Fig. 12 and data not shown). Ithas been suggested that p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 generate distinct pools of PIP37. In response to insulinor other stimuli, an acute flux of PIP3 is produced largely by p110\u03b1 and is efficiently coupledto Akt-phosphorylation. In contrast, p110\u03b2 has been proposed to generate a basal level of PIP3with little effect on Akt-phosphorylation7. The Shokat lab showed that Akt-phophorylationinduced by PTEN loss in vitro was sensitive to p110\u03b2-specific inhibitors7. We propose that itis this basal PIP3 signal that has been enhanced to drive transformation and Akt activation byPTEN loss in the murine prostate (Figure 3d). Alternatively, the differential effects of p110\u03b1and p110\u03b2 ablation may arise because the signal activating PI3K is generated by a yetunidentified GPCR or a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions via p110\u03b2.In summary, our data, together with an independent report from Dr. Hirsch\u2019s group, suggestdistinct functions for p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b1. We have demonstrated that p110\u03b2 plays an importantphysiological role in metabolic regulation and glucose homeostasis perhaps involving a kinase-independent mechanism. A kinase-independent function of p110\u03b2 was further suggested incontrolling cell proliferation and trafficking in p110\u03b2 KO MEFs and MEFs reconstituted witha WT or kinase-dead allele of p110\u03b2. It would clearly be a mistake to overlook the contributionsof p110\u03b2 as a kinase. The basal PIP3 pool catalyzed by p110\u03b2 appears to be \u201csilent\u201d in responseto insulin and other growth factor stimulation, but becomes a \u201cpowerhouse\u201d to drive oncogenictransformation in the absence of PTEN as evident in our mouse prostate tumor model. Takentogether, our findings indicate that p110\u03b2 may be an attractive target for kinase inhibitors incancer treatment with minor metabolic disturbances.METHODS SUMMARYMice carrying floxed p110\u03b2 (generated in this work), floxed p110\u03b18, floxed PTEN29 (H.

Briefly, thetargeting construct was assembled by isolating a 7.5-kb genomic fragment of PIK3CB from129SvEv mouse strain and inserting two LoxP sites to flank the exon 2 of PIK3CB. Thetargeting construct was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells of 129SvEv mouse. ESclones carrying floxed PIK3CB were injected into the blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. Malechimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females to establish germ-line transmission of the conditionalallele. The resulting heterozygous line (p110\u03b2flox/+) was intercrossed to yield a homozygousline (p110\u03b2flox/flox).For metabolic studies, 8\u201310 week old male p110\u03b2flox/flox littermates were tail vein injectedwith 75ul of adenovirus CMV-lacZ and CMV-cre (titer between 1\u20134 \u00d7 1010 pfu/ml, Universityof Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core, Iowa City, IA). Two weeks after adenoviruses injection,glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, pyruvate challenge, and in vivo insulin signallingwere performed as previously described31. Blood glucose values were determined using anAccu-Chek AVIVA glucose monitor (Roche). Serum insulin and leptin (Crystal Chem Inc.),serum free fatty acids and triglycerides (Wako USA), as well as serum cholesterol (Thermo)were measured by ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions.For prostate tumor studies, female PTENflox/flox, p110\u03b1flox/flox or p110\u03b2flox/flox mice werecrossed with male carrying PbCre4 transgene for the prostate-specific deletion of PTEN,p110\u03b1, and/or p110\u03b2. Details are available from the authors. Anterior prostates were isolatedfrom male mice at 12 weeks old, and subject to gross inspection, histology andimmunohistochemical analysis.Primary and Immortalized Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)MEFs were prepared from embryos derived from intercrossing p110\u03b2flox/+ heterozygotes atembryonic day 13.5 post-fertilization. Primary WT or floxed MEFs, and p53DD immortalizedWT or floxed MEFs were treated with Ade-Cre to generate WT control and p110\u03b2-null (\u03b2KO)cells. Additional control cells used in our study were floxd MEFs without Ade-Cre treatment.\u03b2KO+\u03b2 and \u03b2KO+KR lines were generated by introducing either HA-tagged WT humanp110\u03b2 or a kinase-inactive mutant K805R into \u03b2KO MEFs and then treated with Ade-Cre.Genotyping of MEFs was done by PCR using primer sets: LLF with LLR and SLF with LLR(Supplemental Figure 1).Growth Factors and Western blottingCells were starved either for 2 hours or overnight followed by stimulation with insulin (2.5 \u00b5g/ml or various concentrations as indicated in Supplemental Figure, Sigma I2767), EGF (10 ng/ml, Sigma E9644), IGF1 (5 ng/ml, Upstate 01\u2013208), LPA (10 \u00b5M, Sigma L7260) or 10% FBSfor various periods as indicated in corresponding figures.

The quantification ofWestern was done with Odyssey software version 2.0.Growth CurvesMEFs were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates and stained with crystal violet at eachindicated time points. The dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid followed by plate readingat 590 nm. The values were normalized to the absorbance at day 0. Data shown are the averageof at least two independent experiments.Cell Cycle AnalysisCells were synchronized by starvation in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS for 48 hoursbefore released into the cell cycle by stimulation with 10% FBS.

The assay was performed as previously described33 with AlexaFluor555-conjugated human transferrin (Invitrogen), counter-stained with DAPI (1 \u00b5g/ml)(Sigma), and mounted with mounting media (Fisher Scientific). Cells were visualized with aZeiss confocal microscope LSM510META/NLO at 63\u00d7 magnification and images werecaptured by Zeiss confocal microscope software 3.2.Laser Capture Microdissection and DNA ExtractionLaser capture microdissection was done as previously described34.

Analyses of the effects of p110\u03b2 deletion on cell growth and signalinga. Loss of p110\u03b2 retards cell growth of primary MEFs. Cells were stained with crystal violetfollowed by plate reading at 590 nm. Absorbance (Abs) at 590 nm was normalized to Day 0to show relative growth. Data represent the mean from triplicate with SD (standard deviation).b. Deletion of endogenous p110\u03b2 protein in immortalized MEFs. Cell lysates fromimmortalized MEFs were immunoprecipitated using antibody against p110\u03b2 and blotted withan anti p85 antibody. In parallel the same lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies againstp110\u03b1, p85, PTEN and tubulin. c. Loss of p110\u03b2 has no negative effect on insulin signaling.MEFs were starved and then stimulated with insulin at different concentrations for 10 minutes.Phospho-Akt was used as the signaling readouts. d. Loss of p110\u03b2 impairs LPA-inducedsignaling. MEFs were starved and then stimulated with LPA (10 mM). Phospho-Akt andphospho-S6 ribosomal protein were used as readouts. e.
