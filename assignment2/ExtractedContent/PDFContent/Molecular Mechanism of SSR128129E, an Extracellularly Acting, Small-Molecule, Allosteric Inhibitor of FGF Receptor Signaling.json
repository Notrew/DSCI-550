Deregulation of FGFR signalingcan lead to cancer development. Here, we report an FGFR inhibitor, SSR128129E (SSR), that binds to theextracellular part of the receptor. SSR does not compete with FGF for binding to FGFR but inhibits FGF-induced signaling linked to FGFR internalization in an allostericmanner, as shown by crystallography studies,nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, freeenergy calculations, structure-activity relationship analysis, and FGFR mutagenesis. Overall, SSR is a smallmolecule allosteric inhibitor of FGF/FGFR signaling, acting via binding to the extracellular part of the FGFR.INTRODUCTIONReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) constitute a major class ofdrug targets (Overington et al., 2006). Most efforts have beeninvested in developing agents that orthosterically compete forbinding between RTKs with their endogenous ligands, such asantibodies recognizing growth factors or their receptors or smallSignificanceFGF receptors (FGFRs) belong to the receptor tyrosine kinanumerous (patho-)physiological processes and a key target fodomains of RTKs are traditionally antibodies, but small chemiinhibiting RTK signaling, have not been described yet.

Only a few drugs that interactwith allosteric sites have been developed for ion channels andG protein-coupled receptors (Christopoulos, 2002; Conn et al.,2009) and kinases (Zhang et al., 2009). In contrast to orthostericinhibitors, advantages of allosteric drugs include specificity andsafety (Christopoulos, 2002).se (RTK) superfamily, which is of immense importance forr drug development.

After screening >105 compounds andchemical optimization, one compound (SSR128129E, abbrevi-ated as \u2018\u2018SSR\u2019\u2019) inhibited 125I-FGF2 binding with mM affinity,although this effect was not saturated (Bono et al., 2013). Thesefindings suggested amodulation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)binding but not necessarily binding competition. Further, SSRreduced FGFR phosphorylation but did not cross the plasmamembrane, while inhibiting cell proliferation at nM potency. Thediscrepancy of the inhibition constants between the SPA resultsand proliferation assay led us to investigate the molecular mech-anisms of SSR. Pharmacological experiments showed that thiscompound inhibited FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling via an allo-steric mechanism (Bono et al., 2013), which we studied in moremolecular detail here.RESULTSSSR128129E Inhibits FGFR andBinds to Its ExtracellularDomainWe identified SSR128129E, referred to as \u2018\u2018SSR\u2019\u2019 (Figure 1A),which inhibited the binding of 125I-FGF2 to the extracellulardomain (ECD) of FGFR1 at mM concentrations in a SPA assay(Bono et al., 2013). SSR dose-dependently inhibited the survivalof endothelial cells (ECs) (IC50 < 30 nM; Figure 1B).Since SSR\u2019s effects on FGFR signaling did not result from aninhibition of FGF binding to FGFRs (Bono et al., 2013), impaireddimerization of FGFRs or FGF ligands (Figures S1A and S1B490 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.available online), or TK inhibition (Figure 1C), we used satura-tion transfer difference (STD)-nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) to analyze if, after FGFR irradiation, the NMR signal (satu-ration) would spread to SSR, which would indicate that SSRinteracts with FGF. However, SSR did not bind FGF1 or FGF2(Figure S1C).We assessed if SSR bound FGFR-ECD, in which D2 and D3constitute the major binding site for FGFs and coreceptors.STD-NMR showed that SSR bound all constructs containingD2 and/or D3 (Table S1). Figure 1D shows the STD-NMR spectraof FGFR1 and FGFR4 with SSR. Together with the functionalassays, these data suggest a direct (orthosteric) or indirect(allosteric) inhibition of FGF binding to ECD of FGFR and/or thebiological function of the receptor.SSR Inhibits FGF-Induced Signaling and EndocytosisPathwaysTo dissect how SSR interfered with FGFR, we studied its effecton ERK1/2 activation and FGFR endocytosis. SSR blocked theFGF2-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2A)and translocation of cell surface FGFR4 to the cytosol (Fig-ure 2B). In addition, SSR inhibited the FGF2-induced intracellularaccumulation of early endosomal antigen1 positive (EEA1+) vesi-cles, the destination of internalized FGFRs (Figures 2C and 2D).Similar effects of SSR on FGFR internalization and phosphoryla-tion of FRS-2 (target of FGFR2) and ERK1/2 were observed inhuman gastric SNU-16 cancer cells, in which these processesrely on FGF7/FGFR2 (Figures 2E and 2F), and in FGFR2-overex-pressing L6 cells (see below). Blockage of FGFR internalizationcould explain the inhibition of FGFR signaling, though other opin-ions exist (Belleudi et al., 2007; Reilly et al., 2004).A BC DEFFigure 2.

The asterisk indicates p < 0.05.Cancer CellMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRsStructural Properties of Extracellular FGFR Domains D2and D3To map the interaction site of SSR with FGFR-ECD, we firstgenerated two-dimensional (2D) 15N-HSQC NMR spectra ofFGFR-ECD in the absence of SSR to obtain the protein\u2019s finger-print. Peaks in this spectrum correspond to amide groups (andnitrogen-containing side-chains). Since chemical shift perturba-tions (CSPs) of these peaks are sensitive to the chemical envi-ronment, this technique allows identification of SSR interactionsites with FGFR-ECD.The spectrum of D2 showed sharp peaks and spectral disper-sion, as expected for a well-folded domain with defined struc-ture, and all NMR resonances were assigned to a particularresidue. In contrast, the signals of D3 could not be detected,because they were broadened beyond detection, indicatingthat D3 does not adopt a stable, persistent three-dimensional(3D)-fold (Figures S2A\u2013S2F). This behavior is consistent witha transiently unfolded flexible state, a phenomenon confirmedby D30s high tendency to aggregate (data not shown). Becausethis behavior can be an inherent property of the domain or,alternatively, a preparation artifact compromising the analysisof a potential interaction with SSR, we generated preparationsof functional, structured D3. However, optimization of condi-tions to solubilize D3, variations of D3 constructs (with/withoutCancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 491Cancer CellMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRsmembrane or D2D3-Linker), or attachment of solubilizing fusionconstructs (thioredoxin, protein G) all failed to yield spectraconsistent with a stable D3 fold, while the other domains re-mained readily detectable (Figures S2A\u2013S2D).Such a very flexible (intrinsically disordered; Tompa, 2011)state of proteins can be characterized by computer simulationsthat estimate the preferred conformational state and stability ofvarious parts of the protein. We therefore performed multi-ms-long, unbiased, all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics(MD) computer simulations with the Amber99SB*-ILDN forcefield. In line with NMR data, D3 was marginally stable andpartially disordered in solution. The Thr319-Arg330 region, whichhas an extended b-conformation in the crystal structure, tendedto adopt an a-helical conformation and to detach from theprotein core, leading to partial unfolding of the domain. Plasticityof this region, in particular of the bC0-bE loop (Pro307-Val332)plays a key role in the specificity of FGF binding to FGFR splicevariants (Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009). Noteworthy, thealgorithm AGADIR also predicted a propensity for a helix confor-mation of the Thr319-Arg330 region, thus independently confirm-ing the MD computer simulations.To assess if the flexibility of D3 corresponds to a completelyrandom (random coil) or compact but unfolded (molten globule[MG]) state and to verify the chemical purity and quality of theprotein used in the NMR experiments, we performed FGFR2-D2D3 crystallization trials. We resolved a similar structure ofthe FGFR2-FGF1 complex, as reported (Plotnikov et al., 1999;Schlessinger et al., 2000). A defined electron density of D3 re-vealed a stable structure, suggesting that D3 is only marginallyunstable and ready to fold in conditions of crystallization and/or upon forces taking place in the crystal. These observationsare compatible with a molten globule state of D3 (in line withthe increased aggregation propensity and disappearance ofNMR peaks). Control experiments showed that the amino acidcomposition of the urea-unfolded D2D3 polypeptide chainwas correct (Figures S2E and S2F), that D3 folding was not en-forced by crystallization conditions (Figures S2G and S2H),and that D2D3 interactedwith FGF1 (Figures S2Gand S2I). Sincethe crystal structure indicates that D2 and D3 are needed tointeract with FGF (Plotnikov et al., 1999; Schlessinger et al.,2000), these findings show that D3 is present and functional.Thus, D2 is well folded, while D3 is in an unfolded MG statethat is ready to fold.Mode of Action of SSR: Effects on D2We then explored to which sites SSR binds in the FGFR ECD andused 2DNMR to determine the CSP values upon addition of SSRto D2 of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4. SSR-induced CSPs weremapped on the X-ray structure of FGF2/FGFR1-D2D3/heparin(Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1FQ9; Schlessinger et al.,2000). The CSPs suggested a conserved binding site of SSR inthe vicinity of\u2014but not overlapping with\u2014the heparin bindingsite of D2 (red balls show residues interacting with SSR in D2of FGFRs; Figures 3A and 3B). Chemical shift titration analysisyielded a binding affinity of SSR to D2 of FGFR1, \ufffd2 and \ufffd4 inthe mM range (Table S2). These affinities are two to three ordersof magnitude too low to explain the mM SPA data. Moreover, thecomputational estimation of the free binding energy of SSR toFGFR2-D2 (\ufffd5 kcal/mol) is in line with the mM range of the492 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.observed KD values (Figure 3C). Thus, an interaction of SSRwith D2 alone cannot account for the cellular effects.We therefore performed binding experiments with FGF/FGFRcomplexes. Since NMR signals only appear if the protein islabeled with 15N isotope, FGFR or FGF was labeled separatelyto dissect to which component SSR binds. The effect ofSSR on the 2D NMR spectra of (15N)FGFR2-D2D3/FGF1 andFGFR1-D1D2D3/(15N)FGF2 is shown in Figure 3D and mappedon the crystal structure 1FQ9 in Figure 3E. The spatial CSP clus-tering indicates a binding site for SSR at the interface betweenD2 and FGF, in agreement with the binding of SSR to D2 alone.Confirming STD-NMR experiments that SSR does not bind toFGF1 or FGF2, SSR induced CSPs in FGF only when a FGF/FGFR complex was formed. When analyzing the complexbetween FGFR1-D1D2D3 and (15N)FGF2, two additional CSPswere observed: Asn101 (facing D2 in crystal structure 1FQ9)and Ala57 (facing D3; black circle in Figure 3E, bottom), suggest-ing an additional binding site for SSR in D3. To evaluate SSR\u2019saffinity for FGFR/FGF, we performed NMR titration experimentsof FGF1/FGFR1-D1D2D3 with SSR, yielding an affinity constantin the low mM range (\ufffd50 mM; Figure 3F). Due to the structuraldisorder of D3, a binding mode could not be deduced. Together,the CSP data indicate a binding site on the interface betweenFGF and D2 and a potential binding site on D3. A role for D3 inSSR binding is supported by the mM affinity of SSR to D2 alone,too low to explain the biological effect.Mode of Action of SSR: Low Resolution FGF-FGFRCrystalsTo further assess themolecular basis of the allosteric interaction,we performed X-ray crystallography. Crystals of FGF1/FGFR2-D2D3 complexes with SSR could not be optimized to a suitablediffraction quality, but it was possible to generate crystals withSR128545 (abbreviated as \u2018\u2018SR\u2019\u2019; Figure S3A), a SSR analogwith comparable cellular activity (Figure S3B). Limited by adiffraction resolution of 4.2 A\u030a, the exact binding position of SRcould not be visualized, but conformational protein backbonechanges induced by the interaction with SR were detectable.Molecular replacement (MR) statistics of Phaser (McCoy et al.,2007) were used to compare the observed X-ray diffractionpattern to existing 3D models. This revealed single solutionswithout structural clashes when independently using the threeseparate domains (FGF1, FGFR2-D2, and FGFR2-D3) of theFGF1/FGFR2/heparin crystal structure (PDB code 1E0O; Pelle-grini et al., 2000). These results confirm that the obtained crystalstructures were in agreement with published results (PDB codes1CVS and 1DJS). We also analyzed the translation functionZ-scores (TFZ), as they are a measure of how well the MRmodelfits to X-ray data (a high score indicates a good match). TFZscores in the presence of SR were smaller for D3 than for D2or FGF1 (FGF1/SR = 23.1, FGFR2-D2/SR = 15.7, and FGFR2-D3/SR = 7.5), showing that the structure solution cannot explainthe entire scattering pattern in the presence of SR but rathersuggests a structural change induced by SR.To confirm the above findings and to determine conforma-tional dynamics, we refined the structure of the FGFR2-D2D3/FGF1/heparin/SR complex by generating polyalanine modelsusing Refmac5 to obtain a model that best explains the experi-mental data (Murshudov et al., 1996).

In thepresence of SR, the density of FGFR2-D3 was weak arounda b sheet region (b2 at Asp272-Val277 and b5 at Glu325-Ile329)located \ufffd25 A\u030a away from the orthosteric FGF-ligand-bindingregion in D3. Comparison of FGFR2-D2D3/FGF1 structures inthe absence and presence of SR revealed no conformationaldifferences. However, strong differences in the Debye-Wallerfactors (B-factors; higher values suggest flexibility) wereobserved. Surprisingly, the average B-factor of the X-ray proteinstructure in the presence of SR was strongly increased. Specificregions in FGFR2-D3 at b1b2 (Ala266-Val277) and a1b5 (Thr319-Ile324Glu325-Ile329) showed large decreases in the occupancyof atoms, resulting in high B-factors (Figure 4A).

However,TFZ scores, disturbed electron density maps, and increasedB-factors suggest increased structural dynamics of D3, resultingfrom different conformational states induced by SR.494 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.Mode of Action of SSR: Effect of SSRon FGFR-D3The finding of an intrinsically disordered D3domain in NMR studies andMD simulationstogether with the SR-induced increase of itsB-factors in the X-ray structure led us tofurther investigate the influence of SSR onD3 using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)spectroscopy and in silico methods. By ob-taining an infrared spectrum of absorption,FTIR provides information on the transitionfrom one to another conformation. Additionof SSR to FGFR2-D2D3 increased theamplitude of the amide I band in the FTIRspectrum with a maximum at 1,640 cm\ufffd1(Figure 4B), suggesting that binding ofSSR leads to a conformational change ofFGFR-D2D3 (similar results were obtainedwhen analyzing FGFR2-D1D2D3), in agree-ment with the AGADIR prediction.We used state-of-the-art free energy (DG)calculations and computer modeling tounravel how the conformational landscapeand flexibility of D3 changed in the presenceof SSR. The free energy calculations wereperformed with the Gromacs 4 packageand PLUMED plug-in using metadynamics,bias exchange metadynamics, and steeredMD approaches and the Amber99SB*-ILDNforce-field (Best and Hummer, 2009; Pianaand Laio, 2007). Similar techniques wereused previously to predict the free energylandscapes associated with conformationalchanges and ligand binding in kinases(Lovera et al., 2012; Saladino et al., 2012).Comparison of the free energy landscapesof D3 as a function of the b sheet and a helix content predictedthat SSR stabilizes helix a1 (Thr319-Ile324) and induces a b sheetto a helix transition of part of b5 (Gln325-Ile329), thereby nearlydoubling the number of turns in helix a1. As a result, D3undergoes a conformational rearrangement into an intermediateCancer CellMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs\u2018\u2018H1\u2019\u2019 state, which progresses to state \u2018\u2018H2,\u2019\u2019 where a new hydro-phobic cavity, not accessible in the native form of D3, is formed,in which the hydrophobic Tyr328 residue (solvent exposed in thenative configuration) now faces the core of D3 (Figures 4C andS3C). The difference in free energy between the crystallo-graphic fold of D3 and the refolded H2 state, calculated by twoindependent approaches (bias exchange metadynamics andsteered MD simulations) was 2 to 3 kcal/mol. These data, inagreement with NMR and X-ray observations, suggest that D3binds SSR and undergoes conformational rearrangementswithout becoming fully structured in the SSR-bound state.Mode of Action of SSR: Helix-Breaker MutationsTo assess the importance of Tyr328 in the conformationalchanges of FGFR-D3, we mutated this residue to aspartate,which has known \u2018\u2018helix-breaker\u2019\u2019 properties (to yield FGFR2-D2D3Y328D, termed FGFR2Y328D), as this mutation should reducethe helical tendency and impair the conformational change.Indeed, we hypothesized that the hydrophilic Asp328 woulddestabilize the a-helical conformation and that SSR would notbe able to induce a conformational change in FGFR2Y328D.FTIR revealed that FGFR2Y328D did not exhibit a major shift inits spectrum in the absence of SSR, showing that its overall 3Dconfiguration was preserved. Conformational analysis by FTIRshowed, however, that SSR failed to induce a change in thespectrum of FGFR2Y328D (Figure 4B). This effect was specific,as additional mutations of the Y328 residue (Y328R/I329K) stillshowed the same structural change as FGFR2WT upon additionof SSR, illustrating that not any type of mutation of Y328 per secould rescue the SSR effects (data not shown).The aforementioned observations suggest that SSR does notdirectly compete with FGF binding, but rather that it alters theconformational ensemble of FGFR-ECD, which allostericallypropagates into receptor function changes. The b to a transitionof the b5 helix (Glu325-Ile329) is critically involved in this allostericeffect. To assess the relevance of Tyr328 in transmitting SSR\u2019sallosteric activity, we generated HEK293 cell lines expressingwild-type FGFR2WT or mutant FGFR2Y328D. In the absence ofSSR, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D cells exhibited a similarERK1/2 response to FGF2, showing that the mutation did notchange FGFR\u2019s response to FGF. The mutation did also not alterorthosteric binding of 125I-FGF2 (KD: 54 \u00b1 8 pM for FGFR2WTversus 52 \u00b1 9 pM for FGFR2Y328D; n = 5; p = NS). However,SSR\u2019s ability to inhibit FGF2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylationwas reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (IC50 value: 121 \u00b1 30 nM) ascompared to FGFR2WT cells (IC50 value: 28 \u00b1 12 nM; p < 0.05)(Figures 5A and 5B). Similar data were obtained for FGFR2 phos-phorylation and phospho-FRS2 signaling (Figures 5C and 5D).We also stably overexpressed FGFR2WT or FGFR2Y328D in L6myoblast cells (which lack endogenous FGFRs). Transducedcells were treated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated FGF2, leadingto the formation of FGF2/FGFR2 at the cell membrane and itsinternalization in endocytic vesicles. Upon stimulation, FGFR2WTand FGFR2Y328D were comparably endocytosed (Figures 5E and5F). Notably, SSR reduced endocytosis in FGFR2WT but not inFGFR2Y328D cells (Figures 5E and 5F). To unravel the endocyticpathway, inhibitors of clathrin- (Pitstop2) and caveolin-depen-dent (Dyngo-4a) pathways were used. Only Dyngo-4a affectedendocytosis of FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D, indicating that theFGF2 endocytic pathway relies on caveolae-dependent internal-ization (Figures 5E and 5F), consistent with previous reports(Irschick et al., 2013). Thus, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D showedsimilar profiles with respect to FGF2 affinity, ERK1/2 phosphor-ylation, and receptor internalization, but SSR inhibited signalingmore efficiently in FGFR2WT than FGFR2Y328D cells. Thus, byaltering the b to a transition of the b5 strand and thereby elon-gating the a1 helix, SSR modulates inhibition of FGFR signalingand internalization.Mode of Action of SSR: Binding of SSR to D3 H2Because of the flexibility in D3, we performed in silico bindingstudies using metadynamics, a recently developed method todock ligands on receptors in water solution, allowing proteinflexibility (Laio and Gervasio, 2008). This revealed that the freeenergy of binding to the hydrophobic cavity in the H2 statewas \ufffd10.2 kcal/mol (Figure 6A), reflecting tight binding in thenM range. Overall, very long all-atom MD simulations and freeenergy calculations with metadynamics confirmed that SSRalters the flexibility and conformational propensity of D3. Thestability of the helical region in FGFR2-D3 is enhanced by aninitial step of low-affinity SSR binding, thereby making a newmetastable H2 state accessible, which is stabilized by dockingof SSR (Figures 6B\u20136D and S3C). Superposing D30s structurein its SSR-boundH2 state with previously identified crystal struc-ture of FGFR2-D2D3 showed that the FGF-interacting residuesremain unaffected, in line with findings that SSR did not alterthe affinity of FGFs.In addition, free energy calculations showed that FGFR2Y328Dunderwent helix elongation and adopted the conformationalstate H2, though H2 was less stable. This relates to the factthat stabilization of the cavity is largely due to interactions ofthe hydrophobic Tyr328 with the core of D3 and that these inter-actions are highly unfavorable in FGFR2-D3Y328D, in which thehydrophilic Asp328 prefers solvent exposure rather than buriedconformations. Our finding that Y328D reduces but does noteliminate SSR binding explains why FGFR2Y328D is still capableof binding SSR but also why its signaling is inhibited less by SSR.Structure-Activity Relationship AnalysisExperimental and computational approaches suggest a noncon-ventional allosteric regulation of FGFR function by binding ofSSR to the disordered ensemble of D3. MD simulations outlinethe major structural features of the H2 state and schematicfeatures of the arising binding cavity. To further probe themolec-ular details of the D3-SSR interaction, we analyzed the structureactivity relationship (SAR) of a set of 19 SSR analogs by com-paring their biological activity (inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2signaling) to their capacity to dock into the in silico-identifiedbinding pocket of D3 (H2 state) using the Schro\u0308dinger Glide XPpackage on the nonflexible H2 state of FGFR2-D3. As shownin Table S3, two active SSR analogs inhibited ERK1/2 phosphor-ylation with a comparable efficiency as SSR (IC50 \ufffd 10\u2013100 nM);their activity was reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (Table S4), con-firming the specificity of their activity. Six other compoundshad weak biological activity (IC50 \ufffd 100\u20131,000 nM), whileanother tenmolecules were inactive (IC50 > 1,000 nM). One com-pound could not be tested because of insolubility.

Likewise, the bulky CONHMeat R6 (compound 8) is not tolerated, probably because ofsteric clashes with the hydrophobic pocket. Other substitutionsA BC DFigure 6.

Also, to allow flexibility ofprotein movements, we calculated the free binding energy (DG)of these compounds using metadynamics, which, in contrast tostandard modeling on a rigid structure, also takes into accountmovements of the protein. The agreement between the calcu-lated DG and biological activity is superior to that obtained withthe Glide XP score (Table 1; Figures 7B and S4B). For instance,when we subtract the thermodynamic penalty of state H2(2 to 3 kcal/mol) from the calculated binding free energies, we ob-tained \ufffd8/\ufffd9 and \ufffd9/\ufffd10 kcal/mol for SSR and compound 2,which is in very close agreement with the expected value of\ufffd8.5 kcal/mol for compounds in the 100 nM affinity range. Anagreement is also obtained for weak and inactive compounds.The superior agreement of the free energy (calculated by Meta-dynamics) over the docking scores (calculated by Glide XP)stresses the importance of considering flexibility and explicitwater hydration.This view is also supported by NMR measurements, in whichSTD and waterLOGSY NMR were used to rank binding of thissubset of compounds (Table 1). The NMR data are in goodagreement with the calculated binding energy values and bio-Cancer Cell 23, 489\u20135logical potency. Two compounds fromthe active group bound the strongest,and SSR itself was the third strongestbinder, which also underscores that,besides binding strength itself, thecompatibility with the structural allosterictransition is also important for the effectof the compound. Again, adding largegroups at R1 induces the most profoundeffect (compound 17 being the weakestand compound 18 being undetectableby NMR due to protein precipitation). Overall, the bindingaffinity of SSR variants and their allosteric effect of bindinggenerally correlate: the stronger a derivative binds, the more itdrives the conformation of the receptor toward the inhibitedensemble.DISCUSSIONIn the accompanying paper (Bono et al., 2013), we identifiedSSR, a synthetic inhibitor of the FGF tyrosine kinase receptor,and provided pharmacological evidence for an allosteric mech-anism. This orally deliverable, small-molecule, multi-FGFR inhib-itor showed promising therapeutic anticancer efficacy (Bonoet al., 2013). SSR does not affect orthosteric FGF ligand binding,cannot penetrate the membrane, and does not directly block theTK activity but exhibits typical pharmacological allosteric fea-tures. Indeed, the compound shows signaling bias by inhibitingERK1/2 activation (relying on FGFR internalization) without alter-ing phospholipase C (PLC)-g phosphorylation, has a \u2018\u2018ceiling\u2019\u2019effect, and exhibits \u2018\u2018probe dependence\u2019\u2019 (Bono et al., 2013).All these findings suggest an allosteric conformational effectthat discriminatively affects the readout of receptor activation.In this study, efforts were made to unravel the molecular mech-anisms of the allosteric activity of SSR. The challenge in theseinvestigations is due to both the complexity of the FGFRs andthe disordered, even unfolded nature of domain D3, which isprone to aggregation, invisible to NMR, and highly flexible inthe X-ray structures in the presence of SSR.01, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 497A B CFigure 7.

The asterisk indicates p < 0.05 between the indicated conditions (dashed lines); horizontal full lines represent averages.(C) Under normal conditions, heparin sulfate-bound FGF (orange circle) binds to FGFR ECD via D2 (green) and D3 (red). While D2 is well folded, D3 is ina disordered native (N, probably corresponding to amolten globule) state. The receptor can dimerize and induce distinct intracellular signaling pathways, such asreceptor internalization (leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and PLC-g phosphorylation. Due to its inherent flexibility, D3 can transit to an alternative disorderedstate (H1), which is more open and competent for weak SSR binding. From this state, there is a transition to a third disordered state (H2), which binds SSRstronger. In this state, SSR does not inhibit FGF binding or dimerization, but, due to altering the conformational ensemble and/or dynamics of D3, it inhibitsreceptor internalization. Allostery of the system arises from SSR acting indirectly via long-range conformational effects in the disordered ensemble, attenuatingmembrane interaction.See also Figure S4 and Tables S3 and S4.Cancer CellMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRsAt first, it may appear surprising that a small molecule like SSRis capable of inhibiting the responses of various FGFRs tomultiple FGF ligands if steric hindrance of the orthosteric FGFRpocket was the desired mode of receptor targeting. However,an allosteric interaction with a small molecule can perturb thesignaling of a large FGF ligand by inducing a conformationalchange in FGFR. The model that emerges from computer simu-lations and modeling reconciles the experimental findings bypredicting a marginally stable D3 fold, a weak SSR binding siteon D2, and a conformational change in D3 in the presence ofSSR. The AGADIR software also independently predicteda conformational preference of a helix over b sheet structure.The conformational change gives rise to a new hydrophobiccavity, to which SSR can bind. A mutation that reduced thea-helical propensity in this region was predicted to suppressthe SSR-induced conformational changes in silico and indeedcounteracted SSR\u2019s ability to inhibit FGFR-driven cellularprocesses.The key element of the model is the allosteric nature of SSR\u2019saction. Whereas this molecule was selected by using the SPAassay for FGF binding and has nM pharmacological effects, itdoes not interfere with FGF binding or receptor dimerization ina cellular context. Because SSR is not internalized, it acts onthe extracellular part of the receptor. Direct SSR binding toFGFR was indeed demonstrated experimentally, as was theconformational change that is critical for affecting receptor func-tion. Allostery also follows from the \u2018\u2018ceiling\u2019\u2019 effect, the differen-498 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.tial effect on distinct downstream signaling pathways, and\u2018\u2018probe dependence\u2019\u2019 (Bono et al., 2013). All these observationscan be reconciled with data from structural experiments andmodeling calculations in the followingmodel: (1) an SSR-inducedconformational rearrangement of D3 is suggested by most tech-niques; (2) structural disorder of D3 is confirmed by NMR, MDsimulations, and high-crystallographic B-factors; and (3) defec-tive receptor internalization in the presence of SSR is shown incellular assays and suggested by differential pharmacologicaleffects.Therefore, the structural underpinning of the system is that theactual structural state of domain D3 is probably a conformationalensemble corresponding to a MG state, with a global topologyresembling the structure stabilized in crystallography. Thisdomain thus falls into the growing family of intrinsically disor-dered proteins, which lack well-defined stable folds, yet playkey regulatory and signaling roles in many cellular processes(Tompa, 2011). Its dimerization, even without a folding transition,can be envisaged, as in fuzzy complexes (Tompa and Fuxreiter,2008) such as T-cell receptor zeta (Duchardt et al., 2007; Sigalovet al., 2004). As is the case with MG states, its various conforma-tions are in an intermediate kinetic exchange regime that causessevere line broadening in NMR, making it invisible to the NMR(Park et al., 2011).The native ensemble of D3 samples the minor state H1, inwhich the b5 region tends to adopt local helical conforma-tions; this structural state is stabilized by weak interactionsTable 1.

Local helical conforma-tions are also underlined by AGADIR predictions. Overall, thistransition is compatible with the ability of small molecules tobind to the disordered state, as observed in the inhibition ofMyc-Max heterodimerization (Metallo, 2010). The SSR-FGFRinteraction is likely heterogeneous, as suggested by the failureof observing electron density for the bound SR in the crystalstructure.MD simulations suggest that, upon transition to this transientand heterogeneous complex, a hydrophobic cavity becomesexposed, in which Tyr328 plays a key role. This transient complexmay then relax into a more stable structural ensemble (H2), inwhich SSR is buried in the hydrophobic cavity (Figure S3C).This results in amuch stronger interaction, which does not inhibitFGF binding but alters FGFR signaling, possibly due to inter-fering with membrane binding and/or internalization (Figure 7C).Disorder of this state is confirmed by increased crystallographicB-factors in the SR-complex and MD simulations and is alsocompatible with the allosteric nature of regulation of the re-ceptor. Transitions in the ensemble N / H1 / H2 translateinto different interactions with the membrane and/or differentdynamics and orientations of receptor subunits in the dimer, re-sulting in inhibition of receptor internalization but not PLC-gphosphorylation. In all, this scenario is fully compatible withrecent concepts of allostery, which emphasize the importanceof changes in dynamics without alteration of the equilibriumconformation (Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2009), and/or redistributionof the ensemble of intrinsically disordered protein structures(Hilser and Thompson, 2007). The outcome of these transitions,as seen in in cellulo assays, is an inhibition of slow and irrevers-ible FGF-dependent receptor endocytosis abolishing ERK1/2phosphorylation. A similar allosteric mechanism was describedfor the ganglioside GM3 and EGF receptor; the latter is closelyrelated to FGFR (Coskun et al., 2011).The allosteric effect was also confirmed by SAR analysis,which shows a good correlation of binding free energies ofvarious SSR derivatives and their allosteric inhibition calculatedby metadynamics modeling, while the docking scores, with theirknown limitations, also have an overall correlation with biologicalactivity. This behavior would be fully incompatible with anorthosteric competitive inhibition of FGF binding and can bebest explained by a binding model in which the allosteric activityof the compound stems from its ability to induce the proper shiftin the conformational ensemble of the receptor. In most cases,altering substituent R1, which faces Tyr328, impairs the allostericactivity of the compound, which points to the importance of thisresidue in the allosteric transitions.Mutagenesis studies of Tyr328 are also in line with this conclu-sion, because the Tyr to Asp replacement does not basicallyaffect the D3 structural ensemble, leaving its FGF-bindingcapacity and dimerization intact. On the other hand, it reducesthe capacity of the structure to sample the local helical confor-mations, characteristic of H1 (and H2) states, thus altering SSRbinding and its ability to interfere with signaling. This is in linewith our FTIR experiments, MD simulations, and cellular assays.In addition, this disorder-based binding and allosteric mecha-nism is also compatible with the relaxed specificity of SSR,which is capable of interfering with different FGFR variants indistinct species. This would be difficult to reconcile with a well-folded (preformed) binding cavity on D3, which would limitFGFR isoform specificity toward SSR. Adaptability of the struc-tural ensemble of intrinsically disordered proteins in binding isobserved in many cases (Dunker et al., 2008). A corollary ofthis conserved allosteric regulation in all FGFR structures isthat the receptor may have endogenous regulatory compound(s)Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 499Cancer CellMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRsthat act by a similar mechanism; identifying thesemoleculesmayopen exciting avenues of FGFR research.A final word is due on the difference of Ki values observed inthe distinct in vitro and in vivo experiments. Such an enhancedresponse to small-molecule effectors in vivo is often observed(Hanoulle et al., 2007; Huppa et al., 2010), probably due tocellular conditions, such as the presence of additional (protein)factors or the vicinity of the membrane. The latter is probablysignaled by the preferential inhibitory effect on receptor internal-ization rather than PLC-g phosphorylation. In the case of FGFR,this effect may be augmented by the structural sensitivity of theconformational ensemble of the D3 domain.What are the possible implications of this study? From astructural biology perspective, our study provides insight infundamental mechanisms of how FGFRs transmit signals andprovides unprecedented evidence for allosteric regulation ofgrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We show the impor-tance of taking into account target flexibility in order to under-stand the mode of action of allosteric ligands. In addition, froma biopharmaceutical perspective, our results unveil the thera-peutic potential for FGFR antagonists, perhaps wider than previ-ously attributed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, since SSR blocksnot one but multiple FGFRs and because allosteric modulatorsare considered to have an improved benefit/risk ratio and to offeropportunities for fine-tuning biological responses in a mannerthat is not attainable with classic orthosteric modulators (Chris-topoulos, 2002). Finally, our results show that development oforally deliverable selective allosteric inhibitors of growth factorreceptors is feasible, which creates formidable therapeuticopportunities for the future.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCompound ReconstitutionSSR was stored as pure powder at 4\ufffdC in the dark.

In the corrected Figure 2F, the authors have now clearly separated both partsof the western blot.In Figure 5B, the image of the western blot showing total FGFR2 for the HEK293-FGFR2Y328D cell line was mistakenly replaced withthe image of the western blot showing total FGFR2 for the HEK293-FGFR2WT cell line from Figure 5A.
