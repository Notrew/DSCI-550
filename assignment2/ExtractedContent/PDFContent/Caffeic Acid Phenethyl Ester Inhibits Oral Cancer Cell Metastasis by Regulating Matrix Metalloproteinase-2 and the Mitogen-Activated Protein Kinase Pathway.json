However, the molecular mechanism by which CAPE affects oral cancer cell metastasis has yet to be elucidated.In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of CAPE on the invasive ability of SCC-9 oral cancercells. Results showed that CAPE attenuated SCC-9 cell migration and invasion at noncytotoxic concentrations (0 \u03bcM to 40 \u03bcM).Western blot and gelatin zymography analysis findings further indicated that CAPE downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP-2) protein expression and inhibited its enzymatic activity. CAPE exerted its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 expression andactivity by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and potently decreased migration by reducing focaladhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and the activation of its downstream signaling molecules p38/MAPK and JNK. Thesedata indicate that CAPE could potentially be used as a chemoagent to prevent oral cancer metastasis.1. IntroductionOral cancer is associated with a high degree of local inva-siveness and a high rate of metastasis to regional cervicallymph nodes. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is themost common head and neck cancer and is characterized bypoor prognosis and low survival rate [1]. Metastasis is themajor cause of cancer death and involves multiple processesincluding the remodeling and degradation of the extracellu-lar matrix (ECM) [2]. Various proteinases, such as the matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and plasminogenactivator (PA), are involved in the interactions betweencancer cells and the ECM [3, 4]. The MMPs functionin the degradation of structural proteins in the ECMand regulate several cellular functions including growth,invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [5]. Among thevarious MMPs thought to be involved in human disease,investigators have intensively investigated the gelatinases(MMP-2 and MMP-9). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 andMMP-9 are the principal enzymes involved in the degra-dation of the major structural component of the basementmembrane, type IV collagen [6, 7]. Several studies haveshown that the gelatinases are overexpressed in several typesof human cancer, such as breast [8], pancreas [9], prostate[10], lung [11], and oral [12] cancers. Previous studieshave also identified significantly increased urine and plasmaMMP-2 concentrations in cancer patients [13, 14], withMMP-2 and MMP-9 being considered as predictors of riskmailto:ysf@csmu.edu.twmailto:cwlin@csmu.edu.tw2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineCell viability (% of control)020406080100CAPE concentration (\u03bcM)0 5 10 20 4024 h48 h(a)Cell viability (% of control)020406080100CAPE concentration (\u03bcM)0 5 10 20 40(b)Figure 1: Effect of CAPE on cell viability.

A quantitative assessment of the mean number of cells in the denuded zone is the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).or recurrence of metastasis or as cancer prognostic markers[15].Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is one of the activecomponents of honeybee propolis extracts [16]. Previousresearch has shown that CAPE exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities [17]. In addition,CAPE suppresses eicosanoid synthesis and inhibits therelease of arachidonic acid from cell membranes [17, 18]. Itsanti-inflammatory activity is derived from the downregula-tion of COX-2 expression [19, 20]. Chuu et al. identified thatCAPE suppressed human prostate cancer cell proliferationthrough the inhibition of Akt [21]. Other studies have shownthat CAPE induced apoptosis through the activation of Fasand Bax and the inhibition of NF-\u03baB [22, 23]. However,its effects on OSCC invasion and metastasis and theirunderlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated.This study investigated the association between CAPEtreatment and invasion of SCC-9 oral cancer cells. Ourresults showed that CAPE suppressed the migration andinvasion of oral cancer cells, probably through the inhibitionof FAK phosphorylation and its downstream p38 andJNK signaling pathways. Results also indicated that theanti-invasive activity of CAPE is partly mediated by theregulation of MMP-2 expression and activity, which reducesthe ability of oral cancer cells to degrade components of theextracellular matrix.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Culture and CAPE Treatment. SCC-9, a humantongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line obtained fromATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019sModified Eagle\u2019s Medium supplemented with a nutri-ent mixture, which comprised F-12 Ham\u2019s medium (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10% fetal bovineserum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 2 mM glu-tamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin.All cell cultures were maintained at 37\u25e6C in a humidifiedatmosphere of 5%CO2. For CAPE treatment, appropriateamounts of stock solution of CAPE were added into culturemedium to achieve the indicated concentrations and thenincubated with cells for indicated time periods, whereasdimethyl sulfoxide solution without CAPE was used as blankreagent.2.2. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). For cellviability experiment, a microculture tetrazolium (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) co-lorimetric assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicityof CAPE [3]. SCC-9 cells were seeded in 24-well plates ata density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well and treated with CAPE at aconcentration between 0 and 40 \u03bcM at 37\u25e6C for 24 and 48 h.After the exposure period, the media were removed, and cellswere washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and thenincubated with 20 \u03bcL MTT (5 mg/mL) (Sigma chemical Co.,St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h.

(a) The cell migration and (b) cell invasion were measured using aBoyden chamber for 16 h and 24 h with polycarbonate filters, respectively. The migration and invasion abilities of SCC-9 cells were quantifiedby counting the number of cells that invaded to the underside of the porous polycarbonate as described in Section 2.

Briefly, 1 \u00d7 105 cells wereresuspended in 100 \u03bcL 1x binding buffer (0.01 M Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.14 M NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2). Withan addition of 5 \u03bcL of FITC Annexin V and 5 \u03bcL PI, thecell suspension was incubated for 15 minutes at roomtemperature in the dark. Afterwards, 400 \u03bcL of 1x bindingbuffer was added to each tube followed by flow cytometryanalysis within 1 hour.2.4. In Vitro Wound Closure. SCC-9 cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well)were plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratchingwith a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM mediumcontaining 0.5% FBS, and treated with or without CAPE(0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 \u03bcM) for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells werephotographed using a phase-contrast microscope (\u00d7100).2.5. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays. Cell migration andinvasion were assayed according to the methods describedby Yang et al. [4]. After a treatment with CAPE (0, 5,10, 20, and 40 \u03bcM) for 24 h, surviving cells were harvestedand seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John,MD, USA) at 104 cells/well in serum-free medium and thenincubated for 24 hours at 37\u25e6C. For invasion assay, 10 \u03bcLMatrigel (25 mg/50 mL; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) wasapplied to 8 \u03bcm pore-size polycarbonate membrane filters,and the bottom chamber contained standard medium. Filterswere then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. Theinvaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stainedwith 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a lightmicroscope. The migration assay was carried out as describedin the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel [3].2.6. Determination of MMP-2 by Gelatin Zymography. Theactivities of MMP-2 in conditional medium were mea-sured by gelatin zymography protease assays as previouslydescribed [3]. Briefly, collected media of an appropriatevolume (adjusted by vital cell number) were preparedwith SDS sample buffer without boiling or reduction andsubjected to 0.1% gelatin and 8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris\u2013HCl,pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3) for 12 h at 37\u25e6C.Then the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.2.7. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates. For total cell lysatespreparation, cells were rinsed with PBS twice, scraped with0.2 mL of cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitorscocktail, and then vortexed at 4\u25e6C for 10 min. Cell lysateswere subjected to a centrifugation of 10,000 rpm for 10 minat 4\u25e6C, and the insoluble pellet was discarded. The proteinconcentration of total cell lysates and nuclear fraction wasdetermined by Bradford assay [3].2.8. Western Blot Analysis. The cell lysates were separated in a10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulosemembrane. The blot was subsequently incubated with 5%nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris, 137 mMEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5(a) (c)(b) (d)020406080100120140160180200Proteinase and its inhibitor levels (% of control)MMP-2 activity (% of control)020406080100120MMP-2MMP-2MMP-2TIMP-2TIMP-2CAPE concentration (\u03bcM)0 5 10 20 40CAPE concentration (\u03bcM)0 5 10 20 400 5 10 20 40\u03b2-ActinCAPE concentration (\u03bcM)0 \u03bcM5 \u03bcM10 \u03bcM20 \u03bcM40 \u03bcM\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217Figure 5: Effects of CAPE on the activity and protein level of MMP-2 and the protein level of the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-2.

Blotswere then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase goatanti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Afterwards, signalwas detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)commercial kit (Amersham Biosciences), and relative pho-tographic density was quantitated by scanning the pho-tographic negatives on a gel documentation and analysissystem (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech Corporation,San Leandro, CA, USA).2.9. Statistical Analysis. Statistical significances of differencethroughout this study were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test(Sigma-Stat 2.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, USA).A difference at P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically sig-nificant, and the experiments were repeated three times.3. Results3.1. Effects of CAPE on SCC-9 Cell Viability. Figure 1(a) dis-plays the cytotoxic effects of various concentrations ofCAPE (0 \u03bcM\u201340 \u03bcM) on SCC-9 cells for 24 hr and 48 hr.Results from MTT assay showed that all concentrations,including the highest tested CAPE concentration (40 \u03bcM),had nonsignificant effects on SCC-9 cell viability comparedto controls (P > 0.05). Furthermore, CAPE also did not alterthe cell viability of normal gingival fibroblast at variousconcentrations (0\u201340 \u03bcM) for 24 h (Figure 1(b)). Thus, allsubsequent experiments, therefore, used this CAPE concen-tration range.We further investigated the effect of CAPE on AnnexinV flipping and caspase cleavage.

Inhibition of SCC-9 Cell Motility, Migration, and Invasionby CAPE. In the wound-healing assay, CAPE significantlyreduced the cell motility of SCC-9 cells both dose and timedependently (P < 0.05) (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). At 40 \u03bcM,CAPE decreased the migrated cell number by 38%, 56%,and 82% at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. Using a cellmigration and invasion assay with a Boyden chamber, weshowed that CAPE reduced SCC-9 cell migration and inva-sion significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner(P < 0.05) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). In the invasion assay,the inhibition percentage was 16\u201364% (Figure 4(b)) afterincubation of cells with different concentrations (0\u201340 \u03bcM)of CAPE for 24 h. Our results indicated increased inhibitionof cell migration with increasing CAPE concentration.3.3. Effects of CAPE on MMP-2 and TIMP-2 Protein Expres-sions and MMP-2 Enzymatic Activity. To confirm that MMP-2 plays a vital role in the suppression of cell migration,we compared MMP-2 protein expression in CAPE-treatedand control SCC-9 cells. As shown in Figures 5(a) and5(b), treatment of SCC-9 cells with CAPE downregulatedMMP-2 enzymatic activity in a concentration-dependentmanner (P < 0.05). At 40 \u03bcM, CAPE decreased the MMP-2 enzymatic activity by 57% at 24 h. CAPE also significantlyreduced MMP-2 protein expressions and increased TIMP-2expression in western blotting (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)). CAPE(40 \u03bcM) increased TIMP-2 expression with about 1.58 foldsat 24 h.3.4. Effects of CAPE on Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) Activa-tion. Our investigation of the molecular regulation of cellmigration indicated the involvement of FAK in CAPE activ-ity. Having shown that CAPE inhibits SCC-9 cell migrationand invasion, we further aimed to evaluate any changesin FAK activation in these cells using antibodies directedagainst the FAK phosphorylation site Tyr397. As shownin Figure 6, CAPE reduced FAK phosphorylation in SCC-9cells. The inhibition percentage was 20\u201342% (Figure 6(b))after incubation of cells with different concentrations ofCAPE for 24 h. These results suggested that CAPE inhibitsSCC-9 cell migration, at least in part, through the regulationof FAK phosphorylation.3.5. Effects of CAPE on MAPK and PI3K/Akt Pathways. Weinvestigated the effects of CAPE on MAPK and PI3K/Aktpathways using western blot analysis. Results indicatedthe constitutive phosphorylation of pERK (Figure 7(a))and pAKT (Figure 7(d)) in untreated SCC-9 cells and thedownregulation of p38 (Figure 7(b)) and pJNK (Figure 7(c))phosphorylation in CAPE-treated cells in a dose-dependentmanner (P < 0.05). At 40 \u03bcM, CAPE decreased phosphory-lation levels of p38 and JNK by 51% and 40%, respectively.4. DiscussionThe management of patients with malignant tumors hasimproved greatly over the past few decades. Patients withOSCC now have an overall 5-year survival rate of approxi-mately 25% [24]. However, patients with advanced diseaseoften experience cancer spread to local and distant sites,which is poorly controlled by surgery.

We identified thatCAPE (1) inhibits migration and invasion of SCC-9 oralcancer cells at noncytotoxic concentrations, (2) downregu-lates MMP-2 protein expression and inhibits its enzymaticactivity, (3) increases TIMP-2 expression, (4) inhibits FAKphosphorylation, (5) and inhibits p38 MAPK and JNKactivation.Invasion and migration are considered the most impor-tant characteristics of malignant tumors. Solid tumormetastasis is the major cause of death in human can-cer patients and involves multiple complicated processes.The degradation of the ECM is considered essential fortumor progression [25]. Among various proteases, whichcause ECM degradation, matrix metalloproteinase-2 is themost significant in oral cancer [26]. Previous studies inves-tigated the clinical significance of MMP-2 in different raceswith oral cancer. Immunohistochemical results indicatedthat MMP-2 expression significantly elevated in malignanttissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues. MMP-2 overexpression positively correlated with lymph nodemetastasis [27, 28]. The activation ratio of MMP-2 washigher in the malignant tissues of patients with lymph nodemetastasis as compared with those without lymph nodemetastasis [29]. OSCC invasion and metastasis representmajor obstacles to treatment. Thus, inhibition of metastasisof OSCC by CAPE could provide important preventive andtherapeutic benefitsagainst oral cancer.The result of this study\u2019s showed that CAPE significantlyinhibited the migratory/invasive ability of SCC-9 cancer cells,downregulated MMP-2 protein expression, and inhibitedMMP-2 enzymatic activity. However, our data also indicatedthat the secreted concentrations of MMP-9 from SCC-9 cellswere quite low (data not shown). The function of the MMPin vivo is dependent on the local balance between them andtheir natural inhibitors [30]. The TIMPs are physiologicalinhibitors that bind MMP in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Severalstudies have suggested that measuring the protease/proteaseinhibitor ratio in some tumors can provide an exactreflection of ECM remolding [31]. However, the relationshipbetween metastasis and TIMP-2 remains controversial. Inprevious studies, TIMP-2 overexpression protected cancercells from apoptosis and reduced cell invasion in varioustumor cell lines [32, 33]. In other clinical analyses, TIMP-2expression was positively associated with tumor recurrence[34]. Our data suggested a role for TIMP-2 in the preventionof tumor cell invasion because its expression is upregulatedin CAPE-treated SCC-9 cells.Previous studies have well established the role of theMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in theregulation of MMP expression and metastasis of tumor cells[35\u201337]. Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 reduced the rate ofmigration of several cancer cells significantly [38]. In thestudy by Huang et al., the dominant-negative mutant of JNKinhibited the migration of human corneal epithelial cells[39]. In other studies, both p38 and JNK modulated MMP-2 production in cancer cells [40\u201342]. Our data showed thatCAPE treatment inhibited p38 and JNK phosphorylationand downregulated MMP-2 expression, indicating a possiblemechanism for the inhibition of MMP-2 synthesis byCAPE. The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaltransduction pathway is involved in MMP production andcell proliferation, survival, and migration [43]; however, ourstudy results indicated that CAPE has nonsignificant effectson the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.In conclusion, the result of our study suggested thatCAPE partly exerts its antimetastatic effects on oral cancercells by regulating MMP-2 expression through the inhibitionof FAK and MAPK activation. Overall, these data suggest thatCAPE has a potential use as a chemoagent for the preventionof oral cancer cell metastasis.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by a research Grant from theNational Science Council, Taiwan (no.
