Although the drug has long been considered to be an effective and safe therapeutic regime againstinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders, consequences of its cyclooxygenase-independent attributes on platelets, thekey players in thrombogenesis, beg serious investigation. In this report we explored the effect of aspirin on platelet lifespanin murine model and its possible cytotoxicity against human platelets in vitro. Aspirin administration in mice led tosignificant reduction in half-life of circulating platelets, indicative of enhanced rate of platelet clearance. Aspirin-treatedhuman platelets were found to be phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages, associated with attenuation in plateletproteasomal activity and upregulation of conformationally active Bax, which were consistent with enhanced plateletapoptosis. Although the dosage of aspirin administered in mice was higher than the therapeutic regimen againstcardiovascular events, it is comparable with the recommended anti-inflammatory prescription. Thus, above observationsprovide cautionary framework to critically re-evaluate prophylactic and therapeutic dosage regime of aspirin in systemicinflammatory as well as cardiovascular ailments.Citation: Nayak MK, Dash A, Singh N, Dash D (2014) Aspirin Delimits Platelet Life Span by Proteasomal Inhibition.

Thecentral role of platelets in pathogenesis of occlusive coronary andcerebral thrombotic events has prompted in-depth investigationsinto molecular underpinnings of aspirin action. Platelets generatethromboxane A2 (TXA2) in response to diverse physiologicalstimuli like collagen, thrombin and ADP that cause amplificationof platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [3,4]. Aspirin andother non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectivelyattenuate activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), whichcatalyzes biosynthesis of cyclic prostanoids like TXA2, prostacyclinand other prostaglandins (PG) [5]. Although this accounts forstrong anti-thrombotic potential of aspirin, inhibition of prosta-glandin synthesis, too, results in altered functions of normallyprotective prostaglandins with potentially serious consequences.Aspirin-induced inhibition of COX results in loss of cytoprotectiveeffects of PGE2 on gastric mucosa, which partly accounts forgastrointestinal side effects associated with aspirin therapy [5\u20138],especially during high dosage of aspirin administered for treatmentof systemic inflammatory ailments including rheumatoid arthritis[9].Aspirin also elicits effects that are independent of COXinhibition [10\u201317]. Prolonged use of NSAIDs has been reportedto reduce the risk of malignancies, though their anti-cancer activityhas not been fully established [18\u201322]. Aspirin induces shedding ofGPIba and GPV from platelet surface through activation of themetalloproteinase ADAM17 and cell death [23,24]. Clinical trialshave indicated that chemopreventive properties of NSAIDs couldbe due to induction of apoptosis [6\u20138]. Several mechanisms havebeen proposed to explain aspirin-induced apoptosis, which includeupregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins [7,8,25,26] and oxidativestress [27,28]. Aspirin has been shown to induce decrement inmitochondrial transmembrane potential and stimulate intrinsicpathway of apoptosis in mouse Neuro 2a cells [29]. There havebeen few clinical studies to suggest decrease in platelet count inindividuals under aspirin medication [30\u201332]. Although aspirinhas long been considered to be an effective and safe therapeuticregime against cardiovascular disorders, consequences of its pro-apoptotic attributes on platelets, the key players in thrombogen-esis, demand serous investigation.Proteasome, the protein degradation machinery of the cell,cleaves intracellular proteins in order to regulate essential cellularprocesses like antigen processing, cell cycle, transcription andsignal transduction [33\u201336]. We have recently demonstrated acentral role of proteasome in determination of platelet life span[37] and the factors regulating its enzymatic activity in humanPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://dbtindia.nic.in/index.asphttp://www.dst.gov.inhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105049&domain=pdfhttp://www.icmr.nic.in/http://www.csir.res.in/http://www.csir.res.in/platelets [38]. In the present study, we have evaluated effect ofaspirin on platelet survival in murine as well as human models.Aspirin induced apoptosis in human platelets in a dose-dependentmanner, which was associated with concomitant inhibition ofplatelet proteasomal activity in presence of the drug. Platelet halflife was found to be significantly lowered in aspirin-treated mice ascompared to control animals. Thus, above observations providecautionary framework to critically re-evaluate prophylactic andtherapeutic dosage regime of aspirin in clinical practice. Despitewidespread use of aspirin against cardiovascular ailments, itspreventive administration in susceptible individuals on routinebasis is not recommended [39\u201341]. Aspirin has been reported tobe safe for primary prevention at coronary event risk .1.5%/yearthough it is not recommended due to associated side effects atcoronary event risk 0.5%/year [42]. In standard doses (325 mg)aspirin poses less threat of gastrointestinal bleeding; however, thebleeding risk is still twice as high as without aspirin [43].Ethics StatementThe animal study was approved by the Central Animal EthicalCommittee of Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras HinduUniversity, Varanasi. Swiss Albino mice weighing between 18 and20 gm (20 control and 40 aspirin-treated) were used in the entirestudy.

RPMI1640 was purchased from HiMedia. Reagents for electrophoresiswere products of Merck. PVDF membranes were from Millipore.SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was fromPierce. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibod-ies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Banga-lore Genei, respectively. All other reagents were of analyticalgrade. Type 1 deionized water (18.2 MV.cm, Millipore) was usedfor preparation of solutions.Platelet preparationPlatelets were isolated from fresh human blood by differentialcentrifugation, as already described [44]. Briefly, blood wascollected from healthy volunteers (majority male) under informedconsent and centrifuged at 1806g for 10 min. PRP (platelet-richplasma) thus obtained was incubated with 1 mM acetylsalicylicacid for 15 min at 37uC. After addition of EDTA (ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid) (5 mM), platelets were sedimented bycentrifugation at 8006g for 15 min. Cells were washed in bufferA (20 mM HEPES, 138 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraaceticacid), supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.6 ADPase units ofapyrase/ml, pH 6.2) and were finally resuspended in buffer B(20 mM HEPES, 138 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,0.36 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). The final cell count was adjusted to0.52.86109/ml. All steps were carried out under sterile conditionsand precautions were taken to maintain the cells in restingcondition.Proteasome activity assayPlatelets were incubated at 37uC for 30 min with aspirin (2, 5and 10 mM) or vehicle (ethanol) and washed twice in buffer A (seeabove). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 125 ml of 26permeabilization buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.2% Triton X-100,300 mM NaCl and 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.7) followed by addition of125 ml of 26 proteasome assay buffer (40 mM HEPES, 1 mMEDTA and 0.07% SDS, pH 7.8). Permeabilized cells were addedto the wells of microplates in a fluorescence microplate reader(BioTek model FLx800) at 37uC. Reaction was started by theaddition of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (25 mM) in DMSO andwas monitored for 10 min (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 460 nm)[37]. Proteasome peptidase activities were determined from Suc-LLVY-AMC-hydrolyzing activity (chymotrypsin-like activity).Cytofluorimetric analysis of mitochondrialtransmembrane potentialMitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dy) was measuredusing the potential-sensitive fluorochrome JC-1, which selectivelymoves across polarized mitochondrial membrane and formsaggregates (red). As membrane potential collapses, color changesfrom red to green due to release of monomeric dye [37]. In orderto study Dy, platelets were pre-treated with aspirin (2, 5 and10 mM) or ethanol (vehicle) for 30 min, followed by incubationwith 2 mM JC-1 for 15 min at 37u C in dark. Cells were washed inphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and JC-1 fluorescence wasanalyzed in FL1 and FL2 channels of flow cytometer (FACSCa-libur, Becton Dickinson) for detection of dye monomer andaggregates, respectively. The ratio of red to green (FL2/FL1)fluorescence reflected mitochondrial transmembrane potential.Flow cytometric measurement of reactive oxygen species(ROS)Platelets were treated with aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) or ethanol(vehicle) as above, washed with PBS and incubated withH2DCFDA (1 mM) for 30 min at 37uC in dark. Cells were nextwashed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry asdescribed previously [45].Measurement of annexin v and P-selectin binding byflow cytometryPlatelets (16108 cells in 100 ml) were incubated at 37uC for30 min in the presence aspirin or vehicle as stated above. Forpositive control the washed platelets were treated with thrombin (1U/ml) for 10 min without stirring. Then equal amount of 4%paraformaldehyde was added to the cells and incubated for30 min, which was followed by washing. Post-fixed resuspendedplatelets were labeled with 5 ml FITC-labeled P-selectin antibody,5 ml PE-labeled anti-CD61 antibody and 10 ml FITC-labeledannexin V (in preseance of 5 mM CaCl2 to promote binding).Samples were incubated for 30 min at RT in dark and analyzedon the flow cytometer [45]. After compensation between FITCand PE, all fluorescence data were collected using four-quadrantlogarithmic amplification. Data from CD61-positive 10,000 eventswere collected for each sample.Caspase-3 activity assayTo determine cytosolic caspase-3 activity, samples were pre-treated with 2, 5 and 10 mM of aspirin or vehicle (ethanol) andAspirin Delimits Platelet Life SpanPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049lysed with equal amount of 26 RIPA buffer. After 10 minincubation in ice, equal volume of 26 substrate buffer (20 mMHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT and10 mM caspase substrate AC-DEVD-AMC) was added to eachlysate and further incubated for 30 min at 37uC [45]. Caspase-3activity was determined from the extent of cleavage of fluorogenicsubstrate measured at 460 nm emission (excitation, 360 nm).Western blottingProteins were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE and electropho-retically transferred onto PVDF membrane (0.8 mA/cm2, 2 h) ina semi-dry blotter (TE 77 PWR, GE Healthcare) for subsequentprobing as described previously [37]. Blots were incubated for 1 hrwith 5% (w/v) BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%Tween 20 (TBST) to block residual protein binding sites.Membranes were incubated overnight at 4uC with the primaryantibody (anti-Bax, 1:500). Blots were incubated with theappropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted1:10,000) and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagentsfor 5 min. Blots were exposed to photographic films anddensitometrically scanned. For protein loading control, mem-branes containing whole cell lysates were reprobed with the anti-actin antibody (1:1000).Platelet clearance analysisMice were orally administered with aspirin (10 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively, in two groups) for 4 days. The control animalswere administered with vehicle. In different experiments micewere intravenously injected with 50 and 75 mg/kg of aspirin.NHS-biotin (600 mg) was injected in tail vein of either ethanol(control) or aspirin administered mice [46]. At various time points50 ml retro-orbital blood was drawn from both control as well astreated mice, mixed with 200 ml buffered saline-glucose-citratebuffer (116 mM NaCl, 13.6 mM trisodium citrate, 8.6 mMNa2HPO4, 1.6 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM EDTA, 11.1 mM glucose)and followed by 1 ml balanced salt solution (149 mM NaCl,3.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 7.4 mM HEPES,1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 mM K2HPO4, 3% bovine calf serum).Cells were pelleted at 14006g for 10 min, and resuspended in300 ml sheath fluid. They were stained with FITC-conjugated ratanti-CD41, which label only platelets, followed by PE-streptavidinfor 1 h on ice, washed in balanced salt solution and analyzed byflow cytometry to determine the fraction of platelet populationlabeled with PE.Monocyte isolation, culture and phagocytic recognitionof plateletsHuman monocytes were isolated and cultured as described[47,48]. Briefly, blood from healthy donors was collected in citrateand peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolatedusing Hysep, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Monocyteswere further isolated by plating the PBMCs on polystyrene-coatedtissue culture flasks for 4 h at 37uC, followed by 3 washes with PBSto remove non-adherent lymphocytes. Monocytes (250,000 in500 ml volume) were then plated on 6-well plates in RPMI 1640supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 7days to obtain the monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs).Platelets labeled with calcein-AM were incubated with a mono-layer of autologous monocyte-derived adherent human macro-phages for 45 min. Following incubation period, the phagocytemonolayer was washed free of non-interacting platelets, and anyadherent platelets were removed by treatment with trypsin at 37uCfor 5 min followed by 5 mM EDTA at 4uC. MDMs wererecovered by trypsin/EDTA treatment for 15 min at 37uC andsubjected to flow cytometric and epifluorescent microscopicanalysis.In different experiments, aspirin (10 mg/kg/day) was adminis-tered orally to mice for 7 days, following which macrophages wereisolated from the peritoneal cavity of animals. Platelets wereisolated from control as well as aspirin-administered mice andstained with calcein-AM. Equal number of platelets from eithergroup was co-incubated ex vivo with respective pre-isolatedmacrophages for 45 min in CO2 incubator. Macrophages weregated and analyzed by flow cytometry for fluorescence signal(FL1).Statistical methodsStandard statistical methods were used. Parametric methods (ttest) were used for evaluation and tests were considered significantat P,0.05 (2-tailed tests). Data are presented as means 6 SD of atleast five individual experiments from different blood donors.ResultsAspirin induces apoptosis-like phenotype in humanplatelets associated with upregulation of Bax andproteasomal inhibitionNSAIDs have been reported to induce apoptosis presumablyindependent of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity [5\u20138]. In order to evaluate aspirin action on platelets, we investigatedmitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dym) and surface expo-sure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in aspirin-treated human platelets.JC-1, a lipophilic cation, was employed to determine alterations inDym. As expected, high aggregate to monomer fluorescence ratio(FL2/FL1) of the fluor was observed in untreated (control) cellsindicative of stabilized Dym, which dropped drastically in carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (protonophore)(30 mM)-treated platelets (Fig. 1A). Incubation of platelets withdifferent concentrations of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) wasassociated with significant decrements in Dym (by 25%, 61%and 93%, respectively) as compared to control (Fig. 1A).Externalization of PS, an anionic phospholipid, from the innerleaflet to outer layer of cell membrane is an invariable feature inthe apoptotic process [37,49]. PE-annexin V binding to cellsurface was studied as a measure of cells undergoing apoptosis. Asexpected, surface membrane was found to be significantlyenriched with PS in thrombin-stimulated platelets as comparedto the resting cells. Remarkably, pretreatment of platelets withincreasing concentrations of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) resulted indramatic increase (by 1.69-, 7- and 11-folds, respectively) inannexin V binding as compared to the untreated (control) cells,indicative of induction of apoptosis-like changes upon aspirintreatment (Fig. 1B). Salicylic acid (10 mM) did not elicit incrementin annexin V binding, which indicated that aspirin caused PSexposure by acetylation-dependent mechanism. To rule out thepossibility of platelet activation in response to different dosages ofaspirin, we examined surface expression of P-selectin, a marker forplatelet activation, in aspirin-treated platelets. Aspirin had noeffect on surface level of P-selectin, which was found to besignificantly elevated on surface membrane in thrombin-stimulat-ed platelets (Figure S1).As apoptosis is known to be associated with cellular reactiveoxygen species (ROS) generation [50], we sought to determinewhether aspirin induced ROS production in platelets. Using thecell-permeable dye 29,79-dichlorofluorescein diacetate(H2DCFDA), intracellular ROS was found to be significantlyAspirin Delimits Platelet Life SpanPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049Figure 1.

BH3-mimetic ABT737 and specific proteasomeinhibitors like epoxomicin (1 mM), PSI (20 mM) and bortezomib(25 mM) were used as a positive control, which induced significantBax activation in platelets (Fig. 2A & B).The pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family induce release ofmitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, which eventually leads tocaspase-3 activation through constitution of apoptosome complexwith Apaf-1 and caspase-9 [48]. As reported earlier [46], ABT737induced significant activation of caspase-3 in platelets (Fig. 2C). Aconcentration-dependent upregulation in caspase-3 activity (by 2-,2.8- and 3- folds) (Fig. 2C) was observed in platelets exposed toincreasing doses of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM, respectively).Proteasome is involved in the degradation of many short-livedproteins that are required for cell survival. We have recentlydemonstrated a central role of proteasome in delimiting plateletlife span through constitutive elimination of the conformationallyactive Bax and inducing apoptosis-like changes in platelets [37]. Inorder to explore the effect of aspirin on proteasome in humanplatelets, we analyzed proteasomal peptidase activity in presenceof different concentrations of aspirin. We found a concentration-dependent attenuation (by 15%, 44% and 61%) in proteasomefunction in human platelets pre-treated with aspirin (2, 5 and10 mM, respectively) (Fig. 2D). Aspirin treatment did not induceany change in the total protein content in platelets.Aspirin leads to decreased platelet life spanPlatelet life span is determined by opposing activities of anti-and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins [46]. As proteasomalactivity in tumor cells influences cellular level of these proteins andaspirin attenuated proteasome function in platelets (our earlierfigure), we investigated if aspirin can regulate platelet lifespan invivo in a rodent model. Consistent with earlier findings [30,31]oral administration of aspirin to mice led to significant lowering inplatelet count by 18% and 32% (on 7thand 15thday, respectively,at 10 mg/kg/day) and 28% and 48% (on 7thand 15thday,respectively, at 15 mg/kg/day) (n = 5) (Fig. 3A). When adminis-tered intravenously in tail vein in mice, 50 and 75 mg/kg ofaspirin decreased platelet count by 50% and 72%, respectively,reflective of aspirin-induced decrease in platelet count (data notshown).Reduction in platelet count could either be due to increase inplatelet clearance or decreased platelet production. In order tostudy former possibility we conjugated mice platelets with biotinby intravenous administration of NHS-biotin and tracked thelabeled platelets ex vivo by incubating cells with PE-streptavidin[44]. Consistent with earlier observation by Berger et al. (1998),platelet half-life (t1/2 = clearance of 50% biotin-conjugated plate-lets) was found to be 80 h in control mice, which droppedsignificantly to 65 h and 54 h, respectively, in mice administeredorally with aspirin at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day for 4 days (Fig. 3B).Intravenous administration of 50 and 75 mg/kg of aspirin to thetail vein of mice decreased half life of platelets by 21 and 37 h,respectively (data not shown). Salicylic acid (75 mg/kg) did notaffect the platelet life span, suggesting that aspirin lowered plateletlife span via acetylation-dependent mechanism.Aspirin enhances uptake of platelets by macrophagesPlatelets undergoing apoptosis-like changes are known to beremoved by phagocytes in the reticulo-endothelial system [52].Hence, we evaluated macrophage-assisted clearance of plateletsfollowing aspirin treatment. Calcein-stained platelets, eitherpretreated with aspirin (5 mM) or ethanol (vehicle), wereincubated with a monolayer of autologous monocyte-derivedadherent human macrophages for 45 min. The phagocytemonolayer was next washed free of non-interacting platelets, andsubjected to flow cytometry as well as epifluorescence microscopyto examine phagocytic uptake of platelets by macrophages.Macrophages were gated and analyzed by flow cytometry forfluorescence signal (FL1). The cells exhibited significantly highercalcein fluorescence following incubation with aspirin-treatedfluorescently labeled platelets, which was reflective of enhancedphagocytic uptake of these platelets (Fig. 3C). This finding wasfurther corroborated from epifluorescence microscopy of macro-phages. Significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity (per highpower field) was found to be associated with macrophages co-incubated with aspirin-treated platelets than the control cells,which reflected facilitated phagocytic uptake of platelets uponexposure to aspirin (Fig. 3D). In different experiment, plateletsfrom mice administered orally with aspirin (10 mg/kg/day for 7days) were incubated with macrophages obtained from the sameanimals. Cells from experimental mice exhibited significantlyhigher calcein fluorescence than the control counterparts (data notshown), which was reflective of enhanced phagocytic uptake ofthese cells.DiscussionAspirin is one of the most widely used medications worldwide,with more than 100 billion tablets consumed each year [53].Aspirin is extensively used under clinical settings as an anti-inflammatory drug and for prevention of thrombus formation/propagation in myocardial infarction as well as stroke by inhibitionof platelet COX-1 activity. Apart from above functions, aspirinand other NSAIDs also reportedly exhibit antiproliferative effect.In this study we have investigated apoptosis-like changes in humanplatelets elicited by aspirin and explored its effect on murineplatelet lifespan in vivo.Here we found that, platelets exhibited features of apoptosisfollowing aspirin treatment, which included drop in mitochondrialtransmembrane potential, enhanced surface exposure of PS, rise incytosolic ROS and activation of caspase-3. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax and Bax-specific mRNA are known to beabundantly expressed in platelets [54,55]. Aspirin treatmentprovoked significantly higher expression of conformationally activeBax in platelets compared to their control (untreated) counter-parts. Bax being a known substrate of proteasome [56,57] we nextexamined effect of aspirin on proteasomal peptidase activity inorder to understand mechanistic underpinning of aspirin effects onplatelets. The drug was found to elicit concentration-dependentattenuation in proteasomal function in human platelets (Fig. 2D),which was in line with an earlier study on murine Neuro 2a cells[29]. However, above observations did not formally establish a linkbetween proteasome inhibition and Bax activity. A limitation ofthis study is high dose of aspirin administered in mice. Althougheffective therapeutic dosage of aspirin against coronary arterydisorders is lower than that employed in this study, drug regimeagainst rheumatoid arthritis [9] and other systemic inflammatoryAspirin Delimits Platelet Life SpanPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049diseases is higher by 5\u201310 fold, which is fairly comparable withaspirin orally administered in mice in our study. Salicylic acid(10 mM) did not evoke any apoptotic response, which indicatedthat effect of aspirin could be due to acetylation-dependentprocess.We have recently shown that, proteasome plays critical role inplatelet survival through constitutive elimination of the conforma-tionally active Bax [37]. As aspirin inhibited proteasome activity inhuman platelets, we next asked whether the drug would adverselyaffect platelet life span in an in vivo rodent model. Administrationof mice with aspirin led to thrombocytopenia. This was associatedwith significant reduction in half-life of circulating platelets,indicative of enhanced rate of platelet clearance in aspirin-administered mice. Consistent with this, aspirin-treated humanplatelets were found to be phagocytosed more efficiently bymacrophages, as demonstrated in vitro by flow cytometry as wellas epifluorescence microscopyFigure 2.

Our observations support the contention that, plateletsshould not be collected from donors under NSAID cover forpurpose of transfusion. A recent report has implicated plateletswith cancer cell proliferation [58] and aspirin has been directlylinked to prevention of cancer [59]. Thus, the observed drop inlongevity of aspirinized platelets suggests a novel mechanisticinsight of therapeutic benefit of this drug in cancer management.Aspirin is widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug againstrheumatoid arthritis and towards prevention of occlusive plateletthrombi in coronary as well as cerebral thrombotic eventsincluding myocardial infarction. Therefore, observations from thisstudy provide cautionary framework to critically re-evaluatetherapeutic dosage regime of aspirin especially against systemicinflammatory ailments though it is a relatively safe drug in generalclinical practice.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Study of P-selectin exposure in aspirintreated platelets and thrombin (1 U/ml) was used aspositive control.(DOCX)Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: DD.
