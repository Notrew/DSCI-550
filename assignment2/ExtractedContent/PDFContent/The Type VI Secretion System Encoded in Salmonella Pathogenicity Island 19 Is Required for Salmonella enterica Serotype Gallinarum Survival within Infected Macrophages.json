"The Type VI Secretion System Encoded in Salmonella PathogenicityIsland 19 Is Required for Salmonella enterica Serotype GallinarumSurvival within Infected MacrophagesCarlos J. Blondel, Juan C.

Santiviago, In\u00e9s ContrerasDepartamento de Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, ChileSalmonella enterica serotype Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a disease characterized by high morbidity andmortality that causes major economic losses in poultry production. We have reported that S. Gallinarum harbors a type VI secre-tion system (T6SS) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 (SPI-19) that is required for efficient colonization of chicks. Inthe present study, we aimed to characterize the SPI-19 T6SS functionality and to investigate the mechanisms behind the pheno-types previously observed in vivo. Expression analyses revealed that SPI-19 T6SS core components are expressed and producedunder in vitro bacterial growth conditions. However, secretion of the structural/secreted components Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG tothe culture medium could not be determined, suggesting that additional signals are required for T6SS-dependent secretion ofthese proteins. In vitro bacterial competition assays failed to demonstrate a role for SPI-19 T6SS in interbacterial killing. In con-trast, cell culture experiments with murine and avian macrophages (RAW264.7 and HD11, respectively) revealed production of agreen fluorescent protein-tagged version of VgrG soon after Salmonella uptake. Furthermore, infection of RAW264.7 and HD11macrophages with deletion mutants of SPI-19 or strains with genes encoding specific T6SS core components (clpV and vgrG)revealed that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within macrophages at 20 h postuptake. SPI-19 T6SS functionwas not linked to Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity or cell death of infected macrophages, as has been described for other T6SS.Our data indicate that SPI-19 T6SS corresponds to a novel tool used by Salmonella to survive within host cells.The Salmonella genus includes over 2,500 known serotypes dis-tributed between two species, S. enterica and S. bongori (1).Salmonella infections can range from subclinical colonization toserious systemic disease, depending both on the serotype and theinfected host. While some serotypes can infect and cause systemicdisease in a wide range of animal hosts, others are restricted to aspecific host. S. enterica serotype Gallinarum has a host range re-stricted to birds and causes a severe systemic disease called fowltyphoid. This disease is characterized by high morbidity and mor-tality, causing major economic losses in poultry production inseveral parts of the world (2, 3). S. Gallinarum has been eradicatedfrom most developed countries, such as the United States, Austra-lia, and many Western European countries, as a result of im-proved surveillance and slaughter practices; however, it is still amajor concern in developing countries (2).The ability of Salmonella to invade and survive within host cellsdepends on the delivery of specialized effector proteins into thehost cell cytosol by two different type III secretion systems (T3SS),each encoded in distinct genomic islands known as Salmonellapathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2. The SPI-1 T3SS confersthe ability to invade nonphagocytic cells and to colonize andbreach the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts. On the other hand,SPI-2 T3SS allows Salmonella to survive within eukaryotic cellsand spread to internal organs, such as the liver and spleen (4).Both T3SS are present in every S. enterica serotype and correspondto the most critical virulence determinants in Salmonella. Never-theless, S. enterica serotypes differ greatly in terms of pathogenic-ity and host specificity, suggesting that other virulence factors areinvolved in the adaptation of different serotypes to specific hostsand/or environments.The type VI secretion system (T6SS) corresponds to a newlydescribed mechanism for protein translocation that is widespreadamong Gram-negative bacteria (5) and has been linked to a widevariety of cellular processes, including virulence in several bacte-rial pathogens (6). We have reported that the Salmonella genuscomprises five phylogenetically distinct T6SS, each encoded indifferentially distributed SPIs, including SPI-6, SPI-19, SPI-20,SPI-21, and SPI-22 (7, 8). S. Gallinarum harbors one T6SS en-coded in SPI-19 (SPI-19 T6SS), which is required to efficientlycolonize the avian host (9, 10). The requirement of a fully func-tional SPI-19 T6SS for systemic infection suggested a role for thissystem in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen-dothelial system (9).Interaction of S. Gallinarum with the avian immune system hasbeen reported to be critical for the ability of this serotype to colo-nize and cause disease in chicks (11). This interaction occurs ineach of the different stages of the progression of avian systemicsalmonellosis, from intestinal invasion and systemic infection tothe immune clearance/persistence of the pathogen (reviewed inreference 12). Nevertheless, despite the critical aspects of this Sal-Received 12 November 2012 Returned for modification 16 December 2012Accepted 19 January 2013Published ahead of print 28 January 2013Editor: A.

Gallinarum with macrophages, especially those ofavian origin. In this context, even though several SPIs have beenshown to contribute to infection in vivo (3, 9, 13), only SPI-1 andSPI-2 T3SS have been evaluated in vitro (14, 15).In the present work, we aimed to further characterize SPI-19T6SS and the molecular mechanisms behind the phenotypes pre-viously observed in vivo. To accomplish this, we analyzed the ex-pression, production, and secretion profiles of selected T6SS com-ponents under different in vitro growth conditions and analyzedthe role played by SPI-19 T6SS in the interaction of S. Gallinarumwith murine and avian macrophages. We determined that SPI-19T6SS components are expressed and produced, but not secreted,under different growth conditions. On the other hand, we deter-mined intracellular production of the cell-puncturing proteinVgrG once the bacteria are internalized by macrophages and thatSPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within murineand avian macrophages.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and growth conditions. The bacterial strains used in thepresent study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/literNaCl) at 37\u00b0C with aeration. When required, LB medium was supple-mented with ampicillin (Amp; 100 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (Cam; 20mg/liter), and kanamycin (Kan; 50 mg/liter). Media were solidified by theaddition of agar (15 g/liter). For SPI-1-inducing conditions, bacteria weregrown in LB medium supplemented to reach final concentrations of 0.171M NaCl, 0.3 M NaCl, or 0.2 M sucrose, as described previously (16). LBmedium (0.085 M NaCl) was used as a control condition. For SPI-2-inducing conditions, bacteria were grown in a modified N-minimal me-dium [5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 1 mM KH2PO4,0.1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, 38 mM glycerol, 0.1% Casamino Acids] ad-justed to pH 5.5 and supplemented to reach a final concentration of 10\ufffdM MgCl2 (17). N-minimal medium, adjusted to pH 7.4 and supple-mented to achieve/reach a final concentration of 10 mM MgCl2, was usedas a control.Standard DNA techniques. Total genomic DNA was obtained fromovernight bacterial cultures using the GenElute bacterial genomicDNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions. Plasmid DNA was obtained from overnight cul-tures using either the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit or the QIAprep Spinplasmid Maxikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manu-facturer\u2019s instructions. PCR products were purified using theQIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) as recom-mended. The multicopy plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison,WI) was used for complementation studies. DNA samples were rou-tinely analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (prepared in 1\ufffdTris-acetate-EDTA buffer) and visualized under UV light afterethidium bromide staining.TABLE 1 Strains used in this studyStrain Feature(s) Source or referenceE. coliDH5\ufffd F\ufffd \ufffd80lacZ\ufffdM15 \ufffd(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rk\ufffd mk\ufffd)phoA supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 \ufffd\ufffdLaboratory collectionS.

Mutant strains with deletions ofSPI-19 (SG1024 to SG1054), clpV (SG1034), icmF (SG1031), hcp1(SG1029), hcp2 (SG1043), and vgrG (SG1044) were constructed using theRed-swap method (18). PCR primers 60 bases long were synthesized with40 nucleotides (nt) on the ends corresponding to the extreme of the de-sired deletion (Table 2) and 20 nt that anneal to the 5= or 3= end of a Camresistance cassette flanked by the FRT sites (FLP recombinase target se-quence) present in plasmid pCLF2 (GenBank accession numberHM047089), which was used as the template DNA. S. Gallinarum strain287/91 (10), carrying the temperature-sensitive plasmid pKD46, whichexpresses the Lambda-Red recombinase system, was grown to an opticaldensity at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 at 30\u00b0C in LB medium containing Ampand L-arabinose (10 mM). Bacteria were made electrocompetent by se-quential washes with ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol and transformed withapproximately 500 ng of the corresponding purified PCR product. Trans-formants were selected on LB Cam agar at 37\u00b0C. The presence of eachmutation was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers flanking thesites of substitution. Also, each mutant was assayed for Amp sensitivity toconfirm the loss of pKD46. Finally, mutant alleles were transferred to thewild-type background by generalized transduction using P22 phage.To obtain nonpolar deletions, the Cam resistance gene was removedby transforming each mutant with pCP20, which encodes the FLP recom-binase. Transformants were plated on LB Amp agar at 30\u00b0C. Individualcolonies were replica plated on LB agar, LB Amp agar, and LB Cam agar at37\u00b0C. Transformants that had lost the resistance cassette and pCP20 wereselected as those colonies that were unable to grow in the presence of Ampand Cam. The absence of the antibiotic resistance gene cassette was con-firmed for each mutant by PCR analysis.To obtain the S. Typhimurium 14028s \ufffdSPI-1 mutant strain, a P22phage lysate from \ufffdSPI-1::Kan S. Typhimurium SL1344 (NCTC 13347)(19) was used to transduce this mutation to the 14028s background.Construction of lacZ operon fusions. To construct lacZ operon fu-sions, the method developed by Ellermeier and collaborators was used(20). This method consists of the specific integration of a suicide plasmid(pCE36) that has an FRT site directly upstream of promoterless lacZY intoa chromosomal FRT site from a previous Red-swap mutation.

These strains were then grown at30\u00b0C and transformed by electroporation with plasmid pCE36. Transfor-mants were recovered in LB, and dilutions were plated on LB Kan 5-bro-mo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\t-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) agar at 37\u00b0C.Growth at 37\u00b0C allows for the optimal production of FLP recombinaseand blocks the replication of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20,resulting in the stable integration of pCE36 and the loss of pCP20. Fusionswere checked by PCR with the appropriate set of primers (Table 2) toensure integration of pCE36 in the correct chromosomal location and torule out the presence of multiple plasmid integrants.Construction of 3\ufffdFLAG gene fusions. Epitope tagging of T6SScomponents was performed by constructing gene fusions between thehcp1, hcp2, and vgrG open reading frames (ORFs) and the 3\ufffdFLAGepitope by a modification of the Red-swap method described by Uzzauand collaborators (21) using primers listed in Table 2. The PCR productswere amplified from template plasmid pSUB11 (Table 3), and the Red-swap protocol was similar to that described above. Each fusion waschecked by PCR and transduced into a clean wild-type background, andthen the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome as describedabove.Construction of a VgrG-GFP gene fusion. A gene fusion between thegreen fluorescent protein (GFP) ORF and the ORF of the VgrG T6SScomponent (termed VgrG-GFP) was constructed by a modification of theRed-swap method described by Gerlach and collaborators (22). The PCRproduct was amplified using primers listed in Table 2 and plasmid p3174as the template (Table 3) and included the ORF encoding the GFP re-porter followed by a Kan resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites. Properintegration of the reporter cassette was confirmed by PCR. Positive cloneswere moved into a wild-type background by generalized transductionusing P22, and the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome asdescribed above.Protein sample preparations. For whole-cell lysates, bacteria weregrown overnight in an orbital shaker at 37\u00b0C and subcultured in the ap-propriate growth media. When the culture reached an OD600 of 0.3 to0.4, the cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). Thesupernatant was removed and the pellet was weighted in order to normal-ize samples. Each mg of bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 \ufffdl of 1\ufffdprotein loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,0.01% bromophenol blue, 5% \t-mercaptoethanol). Finally, the sampleswere boiled for 10 min and stored at \ufffd20\u00b0C.For protein secretion analyses, bacterial cells were removed by centrif-ugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). The culture supernatant was filter steril-ized and mixed with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final concentration of10%. The samples were chilled on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 15 min. The protein pellet was washed twice with ice-cold ace-tone, air dried, and resuspended in 1\ufffd protein loading buffer. Finally, thesamples were boiled for 5 min and stored at \ufffd20\u00b0C.SDS-PAGE analyses and immunoblotting. Polyacrylamide gels(12%) were prepared and mounted using a Mini-Protean III (Bio-Rad,Richmond, CA) PAGE system. The samples were run at 100 V (constant)with 1\ufffd protein running buffer (1.44% glycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.1% SDS).Transfer from the polyacrylamide gel was performed in a Mini Trans-Blotsystem (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). A polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)membrane was activated by immersion in 100% methanol for 15 s. Thetransfer was performed for 65 min at 230 mA in 1\ufffd transfer buffer (1.44%glycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% methanol). The membrane wasblocked by incubation in a solution containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS (25mM Tris, pH 8, 125 mM NaCl) for 90 min at room temperature. Later, themembrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h with the M2 anti-FLAG primaryantibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted at 1:10,000 in TBS. Forsigma 70 detection, an anti-RNA polymerase sigma 70 antibody(ab12088) was used (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a 1:1,000dilution in TBS. After five washes with a TBS\u2013 0.05% Tween solution, themembrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 1:20,000dilution of the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxi-dase. For immunodetection, the Supersignal West-Pico solution (Pierce,Rockford, IL) was used, exposing the membrane on a CL-Xposure(Pierce, Rockford, IL) photographic film.\ufffd-Galactosidase assays. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB brothand then subcultured and grown in 50 ml of the appropriate medium at37\u00b0C in an orbital shaker. Every 30 min, a 1-ml sample was withdrawn toevaluate bacterial growth (OD600 and CFU/ml), and the \t-galactosidaseactivity was measured as described previously (20). Enzyme activities (inMiller units), normalized for cell density (OD600), were calculated usingthe following equation: [A420 \ufffd (1.75 \ufffd A550)] \ufffd 1,000/(reaction time \ufffdculture volume \ufffd OD600), where reaction time was measured in minutesand culture volume in ml. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in at leastthree independent experiments.Bacterial killing assays. Bacterial strains used for the interbacterialcompetition studies included Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 700323), Shi-gella sonnei (ATCC 25931), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Escherichia coliK-12 (ATCC 25922), Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus saprofiticus(ATCC BAA750). Each of these strains was tested for competition againstantibiotic-resistant derivatives of the wild-type and \ufffdSPI-19 mutantstrains. A Cam-resistant derivative of S.

The chromosomal insertion of pWRKC, flanking theattG1 site, was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers LepA_Fand LepA_R (Table 2). For competition assays, each strain was grownovernight in LB media and then collected and washed three times in sterilephosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 13,000 rpm for 2 min). The cell suspen-sions were normalized to an OD600 of 0.5 and mixed at a 1:1 ratio witheither the S. Gallinarum pWRKC (Camr) or the \ufffdSPI-19::Kan (Kanr)strain. Fifty \ufffdl of the mixture then was spotted onto a prewarmed brainheart infusion (BHI) agar plate and incubated for 1 week at 37\u00b0C. Theinitial inoculum was serially diluted and plated to determine the initialCFU/ml. After 1 week, cells were recovered from the plates and resus-pended in 1 ml of sterile PBS, and serial dilutions were plated out on BHIagar with or without kanamycin. The amount of prey CFU was deter-mined by subtracting the Kan-resistant CFU counts from the total CFUcounts.Cell culture conditions. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7and the avian macrophage line HD11 were routinely maintained in Dul-becco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (high glucose iscomposed of 584 mg/liter L-glutamine, 4,500 mg/liter glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% inactivated bovine fetalserum (FBS) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (10,000 nU/ml penicil-lin, 10,000 mg/liter streptomycin, 25 mg/liter amphotericin B) at 37\u00b0C ina 5% CO2 atmosphere.In vitro infection assays. Gentamicin protection assays were per-formed according to Schwan and collaborators (24). RAW264.7 andHD11 macrophages were seeded in 48-well cell culture plates at a densityof 2.5 \ufffd 105 cells per well. Bacterial strains were grown overnight at37\u00b0C in an orbital shaker, and on the day of the assay they were subcul-tured in LB at a 1:30 dilution and grown until they reached an OD600 of0.6. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for2 min), washed three times with sterile PBS, and suspended in prewarmed10% FBS-DMEM to reach a final concentration of 2.5 \ufffd 107 CFU/ml. Thissuspension was serially diluted, and bacteria were quantified by plating onLB agar plates. Macrophages were washed once with sterile PBS, and then100 \ufffdl of the bacterial suspension was added (multiplicity of infection[MOI] of 10). Plates were centrifuged at 250 \ufffd g for 5 min at roomtemperature to synchronize infection, and invasion was allowed to pro-ceed for 45 min (time point 0). After this time, the wells were washed 3times with warm, sterile PBS and the cells were further incubated for 1 hwith 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (200 \ufffdg/ml) to killextracellular bacteria. The gentamicin concentration then was lowered to10 \ufffdg/ml for the rest of the experiment. At 2 and 20 h postuptake, differentwells were washed 3 times with warm, sterile PBS, and the macrophageswere lysed with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in PBS. Serial dilutionswere prepared and plated on LB agar plates to determine viable intracel-lular bacteria. For each assay, viable macrophages were determined bytrypan blue exclusion. The intracellular survival of mutant strains wascalculated as CFU per 105 viable macrophages.Viability and cytotoxicity assays. Salmonella-induced cytotoxicitywas determined by the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay(Promega, Madison, WI). For each assay, RAW264.7 and HD11 cells wereseeded in 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well. The nextday, the cells were infected with the bacterial strains as described for theinfection assays. At 20 h postuptake, the supernatant of infected cells wascollected and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The cytotoxicity reagentthen was added following 30 min of incubation at room temperatureprotected from light. After incubation, absorbance at 562 nm was mea-sured and the cytotoxicity levels were calculated as a percentage of lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) release normalized to the spontaneous releasefrom noninfected cells.For viability and sub-G1 population analyses, RAW264.7 and HD11macrophages were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells per well. Sub-G1analysis allows the detection of hypoploid cells, which are cells with lowerDNA content due to apoptotic cell death. Gentamicin protection assayswere performed as described above. At 20 h postuptake, cells from boththe supernatant and the monolayer were recovered (to obtain a completeinfected cell population), washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm 10%FBS-DMEM. For viability analysis, 5 \ufffdl of a 1 mg/ml stock of propidiumiodide (PI) was added to 500 \ufffdl of the cell suspension, and the sampleswere analyzed by flow cytometry. For sub-G1 analysis, a volume of 500 \ufffdlof the cell suspension was used. Cells were collected by centrifugation andthen treated with 100% methanol for 1 h at \ufffd20\u00b0C. After incubation, cellswere collected and resuspended in 500 \ufffdl of PBS containing RNase at aconcentration of 50 \ufffdg/ml. After incubation for 1 h, 5 \ufffdl of a 1 mg/mlstock of PI was added. The levels of PI incorporation were quantified on aFACScan flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson). Cell size was evaluated byforward-angle light scattering (FSC). PI-negative cells of normal size wereconsidered alive. A total of 5,000 cells per sample were analyzed.Epifluorescence microscopy. For epifluorescence analysis of VgrG-GFP production upon internalization of S. Gallinarum into RAW264.7and HD11 macrophages, cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips in 6-wellplates at a density of 375,000 cells per well. After 20 h, the cells wereinfected with the bacterial strains as described for the infection assays. Ateither 45 min or 2 h postuptake, the cells were washed 3 times with warm,sterile PBS and fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min at roomtemperature. After incubation, the coverslips were washed with sterilePBS and mounted in a 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-contain-ing solution from VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). ForCytochalasin D analysis, cells were incubated for 1 h with 10 \ufffdg/ml Cy-tochalasin D before infection and maintained with this concentrationthroughout the experiment. The samples were stored at 4\u00b0C and visual-ized under an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence microscopyanalysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81 fluores-cence microscope, and fluorescence micrographs were captured using aZeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software.VgrG translocation assays. The vgrG ORF (SG1044), without the cor-responding stop codon, was amplified by PCR using as the template apreparation of S. Gallinarum 287/91 genomic DNA and cloned into plas-mid pFlagTEM-1 (25, 26). The production of the VgrG-BlaTEM recom-binant protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysisusing anti-3\ufffdFLAG monoclonal antibodies. To demonstrate T6SS-de-pendent VgrG translocation, a modified gentamicin protection assay wasperformed as described previously (8). RAW264.7 and HD11 macro-phages were seeded in 96-well optical plates (black walls and clear, flatbottoms) and infected with each of the bacterial strains expressing thecorresponding BlaTEM fusions.Bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 and induced with 1 mM iso-propyl-\t-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) until they reached an OD600 of0.6. The cells were collected and washed three times with sterile PBS(13,000 rpm for 2 min) and resuspended in the appropriate volume ofprewarmed 10% FBS-DMEM. Infections were performed for 45 min at anMOI of 50. Noninternalized bacteria were removed by three washes withsterile PBS, and cells were further incubated with 200 \ufffdl 10% FBS-DMEMsupplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 200 \ufffdg/ml gentamicin. After 1 h ofincubation, the cell supernatant was replaced with 100 \ufffdl Hanks\u2019 bufferedsalt solution (HBSS; Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 3 mMprobenecid (pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (designated HBSS-HP), and 20 \ufffdl freshly prepared CCF4-AM \t-lactamase substrate (Live-BLAzer FRET-B/G loading kit; Invitrogen) was added. After 90 min ofincubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed fivetimes with HBSS-HP. Fluorescence emission at 450 and 520 nm was mea-sured from the bottom using a plate reader fluorometer (Synergy H1;BioTek) (410-nm excitation wavelength, 10-nm band pass). The translo-cation level was calculated as recommended in the LiveBLAzer FRET-B/Gloading kit manual. Briefly, emission values were first corrected by sub-traction of the average background signals recorded for empty wells, andthe mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of a triplicate of wells was cal-culated for each sample. The translocation level is expressed as fold in-crease of the mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of each infected sam-SPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular SurvivalApril 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1211http://iai.asm.orgple relative to the mean emission ratio of uninfected cells. Epifluorescencemicroscopy analysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence micrographs were captured usinga Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software. Images were imported intothe ImageJ software (v.1.44).Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in thedata was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) withDunnett\u2019s posttest (GraphPad Prism v5.0).RESULTSSPI-19 T6SS components are expressed and produced under invitro bacterial growth conditions. A recent report from ourgroup provided genetic evidence of SPI-19 T6SS functionality (9).Nevertheless, no study regarding expression, production, and se-cretion of its components has been performed to date. In order tofurther characterize SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum, operon fusionsto the lacZ reporter were constructed for the conserved core com-ponents hcp1, hcp2, vgrG, clpV, and icmF, and gene fusions to the3\ufffdFLAG epitope were constructed for hcp1, hcp2, and vgrG, asthey encode secreted components of T6SS (Fig. 1A and Table 1).Different in vitro growth conditions were tested to study the ex-pression and production of these components, including (i) stan-dard bacterial culture conditions (growth in LB medium at 37\u00b0Cwith agitation); (ii) SPI-1-inducing growth conditions modifiedto mimic the conditions found by S. Gallinarum in the intestinallumen of the chicken (42\u00b0C, high osmolarity, anaerobiosis) (16);and (iii) SPI-2-inducing growth conditions intended to mimicthose found by the bacterium inside macrophages (pH 5.5 and 10\ufffdM MgCl2) (17). Even though these media cannot fully replicatethe conditions encountered by Salmonella in the host, they haveproven useful for identifying underlying regulatory networks inSalmonella (16, 17, 27\u201329).Expression analyses revealed a growth phase-dependent regu-lation of each gene analyzed under standard bacterial culture con-ditions, with the hcp1 gene showing the highest expression levelsof all the genes tested (Fig. 2A). Gene expression analyses underSPI-1- and SPI-2-inducing conditions showed a significant in-crease only for hcp1 under SPI-2-inducing conditions (data notshown).Production of the structural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2,and VgrG revealed that these three proteins are produced in vitro(Fig. 2B). The Hcp1 protein was detected under all of the condi-tions tested, and relative quantification by gel densitometric anal-ysis of its production revealed that increased levels of the proteinwere present under SPI-2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B). In con-trast to expression analyses, the Hcp2 and VgrG proteins weredetected only at the exponential phase of bacterial growth andwere barely detected at stationary phase or under SPI-1- and SPI-2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B).Regardless of the differences observed for the expression andproduction of T6SS core components, it was not possible to detectsecretion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG to the culture mediaunder the different growth conditions tested (Fig. 2B). These find-ings suggest that additional signals are required for full activationof SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum.SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing underdifferent in vitro growth conditions. An increasing number ofT6SSs have been linked to interbacterial killing against differentGram-negative bacteria through the delivery of different toxinswhich target the peptidoglycan of susceptible bacterial species(30\u201334). A heuristic informatic approach was recently developedfor large-scale identification of T6SS antibacterial effectors (35).In Salmonella, this approach identified several toxin/antitoxinmodules inside the SPI-6 T6SS gene cluster and one additionalmodule in a genomic region not associated with T6SS loci (tae3and tai3 genes in Fig. 1B) (35). Interestingly, this module is pres-ent in every Salmonella enterica genome we have analyzed (datanot shown), so it is tempting to speculate that even though theSPI-19 T6SS gene cluster does not seem to encode a toxin/anti-toxin module, it could be involved in interbacterial killingthrough translocation of the toxin encoded in this novel cluster(Fig. 1B).To test this, an in vitro competition assay was performed usingthe wild type or a \ufffdSPI-19 derivative of S. Gallinarum against apanel of 6 Gram-negative bacteria, including bacteria previouslyshown to be susceptible to T6SS killing. A Gram-positive strainwas included in the assay as a control. As shown in Fig. 3, each preystrain tested grew at similar levels after coculture with either thewild-type or the SPI-19 mutant strain. When the same experimentwas performed under different in vitro growth conditions (30, 37,and 42\u00b0C and SPI-1-inducing conditions), no differences wereobserved (data not shown). These results indicate that S. Gallina-rum SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under theconditions studied.VgrG is produced after S. Gallinarum internalization by mu-rine and avian macrophages. The contribution of the SPI-19T6SS to S. Gallinarum colonization of orally infected chickenssuggested a role for this system in the interaction of Salmonellawith eukaryotic cells, especially those of the reticuloendothelialsystem (7). Because expression of T6SS components in other bac-teria is induced within eukaryotic cells (reviewed in reference 36),FIG 1 Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 and the T6SS-related toxin/antitoxin gene cluster. (A) Schematic representation of the SPI-19 T6SS gene cluster in S.Gallinarum. (B) The putative toxin/antitoxin module identified by Russell and colleagues (35). T6SS core components are shown in gray. Components studiedin this work are shown in black.Blondel et al.1212 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgwe analyzed the production of the VgrG protein within macro-phages. To date, most studies regarding the ability of Salmonella toinfect and survive within macrophages have been performed inmurine macrophages. However, since S. Gallinarum correspondsto an avian-adapted serotype, we chose to use both murine(RAW264.7) and avian (HD11) macrophages and compare theresults obtained for each cell line.A chromosomal gene fusion was constructed between the vgrGORF and the ORF encoding the GFP reporter using the methoddescribed by Gerlach and colleagues (22). The vgrG gene was cho-sen because (i) it is an essential T6SS component, (ii) productionof VgrG was not detected under the conditions we tested, includ-ing those used prior to infection (either LB medium, 37\u00b0C, and anOD600 of 0.6 or DMEM, 5% CO2, and 37\u00b0C) (Fig. 4A), and (iii) ithas been shown that VgrG C-terminal fusions can be constructedwithout affecting the functionality of the corresponding T6SS(37).To analyze the production of the VgrG-GFP fusion proteinafter Salmonella internalization by macrophages, gentamicin pro-tection assays were performed. RAW264.7 and HD11 cells wereseeded onto sterile glass coverslips and infected with an S. Galli-narum strain harboring the VgrG-GFP fusion in its chromosome.This strain also carries the pmCherry plasmid, encoding the redfluorescent protein mCherry under the control of a constitutivepromoter, to allow bacterial visualization. After 45 min of infec-tion, cells were washed and cell culture media added with a finalconcentration of 100 \ufffdg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacte-ria. Two hours postuptake, the cells were washed, fixed, andmounted for their analysis by epifluorescence microscopy. Asshown in Fig. 4B and C, intracellular production of the VgrG-GFPfusion was detected in bacteria expressing cytosolic mCherry inboth murine and avian macrophages at 2 h postuptake.To determine whether production of VgrG was induced by theinitial cell contact between Salmonella and the macrophages oroccurred after bacterial internalization, cells were pretreated withCytochalasin D to inhibit Salmonella uptake. As shown in Fig. 4Band C, pretreatment with Cytochalasin D prevented VgrG pro-duction in both murine and avian macrophages infected with S.Gallinarum. Interestingly, infections performed with the HD11macrophage cell line revealed that S. Gallinarum was detected ingranule/vacuolar structures after internalization. This was notseen in infected murine macrophages (Fig. 4C). Further studieswill be needed to fully characterize the intracellular fate of S. Gal-linarum in HD11 macrophages compared to results from previ-ous studies performed in murine macrophages. Altogether, ourresults indicate that production of VgrG is induced once S. Galli-narum is internalized by macrophages of either murine or avianorigin.SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum intracellular sur-vival within murine and avian macrophages. Intracellular pro-duction of VgrG in RAW264.7 and HD11 cells suggested thatSPI-19 T6SS is involved in the interaction of Salmonella with mac-rophages. To test this, a set of defined S. Gallinarum mutants wasconstructed and tested in intracellular survival assays in both mu-rine and avian macrophages. Gentamicin protection assays wereperformed, infecting each macrophage cell line with either thewild-type, \ufffdSPI-19, or \ufffdclpV mutant strain. As controls, \ufffdssaGand \ufffdaroA mutant strains were also included, as both genes en-code proteins required for Salmonella survival within macro-phages. The ssaG gene encodes an essential SPI-2 T3SS structuralcomponent (38), while aroA corresponds to an auxotrophic mu-tant for aromatic amino acids with impaired ability to survive andgrow within macrophages (39).At 2 and 20 h postuptake, intracellular bacteria were recoveredand bacterial loads were determined and expressed as CFU per 105macrophages. As shown in Fig. 5, none of the T6SS mutantsshowed a significant intracellular survival defect compared to thewild-type strain at 2 h postuptake. However, at 20 h postuptake,each T6SS mutant strain showed a statistically significant defect inFIG 2 Expression, production, and secretion analysis of selected SPI-19 T6SScomponents under different in vitro conditions. (A) Activity of lacZ operonfusions to hcp1, clpV, icmF, hcp2, and vgrG during the bacterial growth curve.Expression was measured as \t-galactosidase activity (expressed as Millerunits). (B) Production and secretion analyses of 3\ufffd-FLAG epitope-taggedversions of Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG from whole-cell lysates and supernatantfractions. The asterisk indicates an unspecific band detected with the 3\ufffd-FLAG antibody. Relative quantification (RQ) of the Hcp1 protein was deter-mined by densitometric analysis and is expressed as the ratio against the pro-duction levels of the nonspecific band detected with the 3\ufffd-FLAG antibody.Detection of the RNA polymerase by an \ufffd-sigma 70 antibody was used as acontrol to analyze protein secretion in the cell culture supernatants. Understandard bacterial growth conditions (LB), samples were acquired at bothexponential (Ex; OD600 of 0.3) and stationary (St; OD600 of 1.8) phases ofgrowth.SPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular SurvivalApril 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1213http://iai.asm.orgintracellular survival compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 5).Bacterial loads per macrophage at 20 h postuptake were similar tothose observed for the ssaG and aroA mutant strains.To directly link the phenotype observed for T6SS mutantstrains to T6SS functionality, the \ufffdclpV mutant was transformedwith a plasmid harboring a wild-type copy of the clpV gene andgentamicin protection assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 6,introduction of the clpV gene in trans restored the ability of the S.Gallinarum \ufffdclpV strain to survive within RAW264.7 and HD11macrophages.To determine if SPI-19 T6SS contributes to cytotoxicity andhost cell death, as described for other T6SS (40\u201342), macrophageswere infected with either the wild-type strain or the \ufffdSPI-19 mu-tant. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by release of lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH) to the culture media, and cell viability was assayed bypropidium iodide (PI) incorporation and analysis of the sub-G1population by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 population is com-monly used as an index of apoptotic cell death (43). As shown inFig. 7, no differences in cytotoxicity, viability, and cell death wereobserved between the wild-type and mutant strains in either mu-rine or avian macrophages. Altogether, these results clearly indi-cate that SPI-19 and the T6SS encoded therein contribute to S.Gallinarum intracellular survival in both murine and avian mac-rophages, and that this T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity and host cell death of infected macrophages.Finally, to assess if the VgrG protein is translocated into thecytosol of infected macrophages, a FRET-based fluorescent assaywas performed using the CCF4/AM substrate. This method hasbeen used recently to monitor VgrG translocation in Vibrio chol-erae (37). A reporter gene fusion was constructed by cloning thevgrG ORF into plasmid pFlagTEM-1, which allows the productionof \t-lactamase fusion proteins under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter (25). VgrG-BlaTEM translocation into thehost cytosol allows processing of the FRET fluorescent sub-strate CCF4/AM. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were in-fected with S. Gallinarum strains harboring plasmids encodingeither VgrG-BlaTEM or SipA-BlaTEM fusion proteins. The SipA-BlaTEM fusion was used as a positive control, as it corresponds toa known SPI-1 T3SS translocated effector protein (26). As a con-trol, infection experiments were also performed using the S. Ty-phimurium 14028s strain. Translocation was assessed by bothfluorometric plate reader quantification and epifluorescence mi-croscopy. As expected, translocation of SipA was observed for S.Typhimurium in both macrophages by fluorometric quantifica-tion (see File S1 in the supplemental material). However, in thecase of S. Gallinarum, we could not detect translocation of SipA orVgrG fusion proteins into either macrophage cell line (see File S1).In spite of this, epifluorescence microscopy analysis showed that avery small number of cells per field presented substrate processingin macrophages infected with the S. Gallinarum strains harboringpSipA/FT or pVgrG/FT (see File S1).DISCUSSIONThe recent discovery of at least 5 different T6SSs in Salmonella hasgenerated many questions of whether these systems contribute toSalmonella host and environmental adaptation. We have previ-ously shown that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to efficient colonizationof chicks infected with S. Gallinarum, suggesting a role for thisT6SS in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen-dothelial system (7). In this study, we characterized SPI-19 T6SSby analyzing the expression, production, and translocation of se-lected components/effectors and by defining its role in the inter-action of S. Gallinarum with murine and avian macrophages.Expression analysis of five SPI-19 T6SS core components re-vealed a growth phase-dependent regulation, with an increase intheir expression when the bacteria reached the onset of stationaryphase (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, analysis of the production of thestructural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG showed aninverse relationship regarding growth phase regulation, with in-creased protein levels detected at exponential phase (Fig. 2B). ThisFIG 3 SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing. Survival of prey strains listed below the x axis was determined by measuring the corresponding CFUafter 1 week of exposure to either the wild type or a \ufffdSPI-19 mutant of S. Gallinarum. Data represent CFU from three independent experiments. Bars representmean values, and error bars denote standard deviations. No statistically significant differences between the mutant and the wild type were determined by one-wayANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s posttest.Blondel et al.1214 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgdiscrepancy between gene expression and protein production sug-gests that these components are under posttranscriptional regula-tory mechanisms, as described for other T6SS (44, 45). Growthphase-dependent expression and production of T6SS compo-nents was not unexpected. Core components of the T6SSs of Yer-sinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to beregulated by the bacterial phase of growth (46, 47), and T6SSs ofAeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aerugi-nosa have been linked to quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms(48\u201350).Analysis of culture supernatants failed to demonstrate secre-tion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG, even under the growth con-ditions that favored their production (Fig. 2B). In this context, it ispossible that secretion of the SPI-19 T6SS is regulated by a post-FIG 4 Intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion protein. (A) Production of VgrG-GFP under cell culture (10% FBS-DMEM, 5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) andstandard bacterial growth conditions (OD600 of 0.6, LB, and 37\u00b0C).

In agreement with this notion, it has beenreported that T6SS activation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa requiresa serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase that regulate thephosphorylation status of a forkhead-associated (FHA) innermembrane protein (51). Even though the SPI-19 T6SS locus doesnot encode putative serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase, itdoes encode a putative FHA domain-containing protein(SG1038) (7). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that activationof the SPI-19 T6SS depends on a similar posttranslational regula-tory mechanism.In order to dissect the putative roles of the SPI-19 T6SS, wetested its contribution to interaction with bacterial cells and mac-rophages. Interbacterial killing assays failed to demonstrate anti-FIG 5 Contribution of SPI-19 T6SS to Salmonella intracellular survival. Gentamicin protection assays were performed using RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophagesinfected with the corresponding wild-type and mutant strains.

Nevertheless, it is important to mention that thisassay is not comprehensive, as other unidentified Gram-negativebacteria can be the target of SPI-19 T6SS, and other inducingsignals might be important for activating SPI-19 T6SS-dependentkilling. Furthermore, the presence of a toxin/antitoxin module(Fig. 1B) suggests that the SPI-19 T6SS could indeed be involvedin interbacterial killing.Cell culture-based assays revealed that the VgrG protein wasproduced after Salmonella internalization by cultured murine andavian macrophages (Fig. 4). Preferential production of VgrGupon phagocytosis was not unexpected, because expression ofT6SS components within macrophages has been described forother T6SS, including those encoded in the tss5 locus of Burkhold-eria pseudomallei, the FPI island of Francisella tularensis, theT6SS1 locus of Burkholderia mallei, and the vas cluster of Vibriocholerae, all of which are upregulated upon phagocytosis (re-viewed in reference 36).When intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion pro-tein was determined, GFP fluorescence was observed in the cyto-plasm of infected macrophages, suggesting that the VgrG proteincould be translocated into the host cell cytosol. To test this, aVgrG-BlaTEM fusion was constructed, and CCF4/AM processingwas evaluated in murine and avian macrophages. Even thoughvisual inspection through epifluorescence microscopy revealedtranslocation in a small percentage of the total cell population,fluorometric plate reader quantification did not determine a sig-nificant increase in the fluorescent substrate processing. Takinginto account that S. Gallinarum is internalized significantly lessefficiently by macrophages than S. Typhimurium, and that trans-location of the positive-control SipA was observed by epifluores-cence microscopy but not detected by fluorescence quantificationin S. Gallinarum, it is plausible to think that VgrG is indeed trans-located under these conditions. Nevertheless, further experimentswill be needed to clarify this issue, including the construction ofdifferent reporter fusions attaching to the VgrG protein.Unexpectedly, fluorescence microscopy analysis showed thatthe VgrG-GFP protein was detected throughout the bacterial celland not in punctate foci in the bacterial membrane, as seen forother T6SS structural components (52). One possible explanationis that the GFP reporter affects the normal function of the VgrGprotein, including its subcellular localization. To test this hypoth-esis, we performed gentamicin protection assays in murine andavian macrophages infected with either the wild-type or VgrG-GFP strain. Results from these assays suggest that the fusion pro-tein is partially impaired in T6SS function (see File S2 in the sup-plemental material).The SPI-19 T6SS expression data are reminiscent of what hasbeen described for the Salmonella SPI-2 T3SS. The genes encodingstructural components of the SPI-2 T3SS are upregulated uponphagocytosis (53, 54), including the ssaG gene, which encodes atranslocon component of the needle complex. Expression of thessaG gene responds to the DNA supercoiling status of the bacterialcell chromosome, as it adapts to the intracellular environment.This activation depends on the direct binding of the Fis protein tothe ssaG promoter region (55). Several Fis-regulated genes show agrowth phase-dependent gene expression (56, 57) due to en-hanced levels of the Fis protein at exponential phase. Therefore,the increased levels of Hcp2 and VgrG proteins in the exponentialphase of growth could be due to increased levels of Fis. In supportof this notion, we have identified the presence of several Fis bind-ing sites in the promoter regions of hcp2 and vgrG (see File S3 inthe supplemental material). Further work will be needed to clarifythis hypothesis and to identify the global regulators that seem to beregulating the expression, production, and function of SPI-19FIG 7 SPI-19 T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella-induced cell death of infected macrophages. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were infected with eitherthe wild-type or \ufffdSPI-19 mutant strain, and gentamicin protection assays were performed. After 20 h postuptake, cytotoxicity was evaluated by LDH release, andcell death by was determined by propidium iodide incorporation and cell cycle analysis of infected macrophages. NI, noninfected.

Gallinarum with macro-phages. Gentamicin protection assays revealed that SPI-9 T6SScontributes to Salmonella intracellular survival in both murineand avian macrophages. Upon phagocytosis, Salmonella is en-gulfed in a compartment known as the Salmonella-containingvacuole (SCV), and through the orchestrated action of SPI-1 andSPI-2 T3SS-secreted effector proteins, the bacterium ensures itssurvival by avoiding phagosome maturation (58). SCV biogenesisis usually divided in early (\ufffd30 min), intermediate (30 min to 5h), and late stages (\ufffd5 h), with a defined set of T3SS effectorsinvolved in each stage (59, 60). By altering phagosome biogenesis,Salmonella is able to reside in mature SCVs that localize in a peri-nuclear region associated with the Golgi network late after infec-tion (60, 61).In S. Gallinarum, the SPI-2 T3SS has been shown to be impor-tant for the ability of the bacteria to survive within murine andavian macrophages from 1 h postuptake (14, 15). In agreementwith this, we observed that the SPI-2 T3SS \ufffdssaG mutant strainshowed a significant defect on intracellular survival at 2 hpostuptake. In contrast, the \ufffdSPI-19 and \ufffdclpV mutants showed asignificant defect only at 20 h postuptake. These observations sug-gest that either (i) the T3SS and T6SS contribute to Salmonellasurvival by modulating different stages of SCV biogenesis, or (ii)the T6SS promotes replication of Salmonella once it has escapedfrom the phagolysosomal fate, as has been shown for other viru-lence-related loci, including the PhoP/Q regulon (62). Furtherexperiments regarding the kinetics of phagolysosomal fusion andreplication rates of T6SS mutant strains will be needed to clarifythese issues.Despite the role of SPI-19 in intracellular survival, there was nosignificant impact on host cell death and cytotoxicity of infectedmacrophages in vitro, as seen for other T6SSs that are involved inthe interaction of the bacteria with cells of the immune system (6).Notwithstanding this, it is plausible to think that the SPI-19 T6SScould influence other processes triggered after infection of mac-rophages, including the production and secretion of proinflam-matory cytokines and chemokines. In this context, it has beenshown that immune responses generated by infection with S. Gal-linarum are critical for the virulence and pathogenicity of thisserotype both in vitro and in vivo (11, 12, 63, 64). Therefore, con-tribution of the SPI-19 T6SS to in vivo colonization of infectedchicks is mediated by these processes in addition to intracellularsurvival within macrophages. Future work will be needed to de-termine these issues.In agreement with our findings, other authors have pointedout a role for T6SSs in the interaction of Salmonella with host cells.Libby and colleagues (65) identified several genes linked to theSPI-6 T6SS of S. Typhi which are required for systemic infection ina humanized mouse model. In addition, Wang and colleagues(66) recently reported that a mutant in an essential SPI-6 T6SScore component enhanced the ability of S. Typhi to invade epithe-lial cells and reduced Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity towardthese cells. More recently, Liu and colleagues (67) have shown thatlack of SPI-6 T6SS in S. Typhimurium leads to reduced Salmonellasurvival and proliferation within infected murine macrophagesand a defect in mice colonization. Finally, Mulder and colleagues(68) reported that several SPI-6 T6SS core components and SPI-6T6SS-associated gene clusters contribute to S. Typhimurium in-tracellular survival within murine macrophages and systemic dis-semination in mice.Since the evidence described above shows that both SPI-6 andSPI-19 T6SSs are involved in the ability of Salmonella to survivewithin macrophages, it is tempting to speculate that despite hav-ing distinct phylogenetic origins, these two T6SSs are functionallyredundant.In the context of Salmonella evolution, the functional implica-tions of this potential redundancy are intriguing. Comparativegenomic analysis of T6SSs in Salmonella have suggested that acommon ancestor of SPI-19-containing serotypes harbored bothSPI-6 and SPI-19 T6SSs in their genomes. During evolution, someserotypes maintained both T6SSs (e.g., Dublin and Weltevreden),others have lost SPI-6 T6SS while maintaining SPI-19 T6SS (e.g.,Gallinarum and Agona), and still others lost both T6SS loci (e.g.,Enteritidis) (7). Therefore, it would be of interest to determine ifthese systems are indeed redundant or if there are subtle differ-ences in their function that could explain why some Salmonellaserotypes retained one of these systems over the other, and if theydifferentially contribute to the adaptation of Salmonella serotypesto different hosts and environments.In conclusion, in this work we have demonstrated that SPI-19T6SS contributes to Salmonella intracellular survival and that theVgrG protein is preferentially produced once the bacteria havebeen internalized by the cells. Altogether, our work expands theknown set of virulence factors employed by Salmonella to subvertthe immune system of its hosts.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe are indebted to R.
