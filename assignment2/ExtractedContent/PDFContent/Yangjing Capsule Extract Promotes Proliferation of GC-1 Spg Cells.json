To investigate the effect of Yangjing Capsule (YC) extract on proliferation of GC-1 spermatogonia (spg) cells and themechanism.Methods. GC-1 spg cells were treated with 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YC extract. MTT assay was performed to detect thecell viability. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle and apoptosis of GC-1 spg cells. Real-time PCR and western blotwere applied to determine the mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 and Plzf. Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor)were applied to explore the underlying mechanism. Results. After 48 h treatment of YC, the viability of GC-1 spg cells increasedsignificantly and the ratio of apoptotic cells reduced significantly. The increased mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 andPlzf suggested YC promoted self-renewal of GC-1 spg cells. Both Gfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNAs and LY294002 treatments held back YC extract\u2019sstimulation effects on mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 and Plzf and consequently inhibited the proliferation of GC-1 spgcells induced by YC extract. Conclusion. YC extract could stimulate the proliferation of GC-1 spg cells. Partly via Gfr\ud835\udefc1, YC extractis able to trigger the activation of PI3K pathway and finally lead to self-renewal of GC-1 spg cells.1. IntroductionAbout 15% of couples have problems in conceiving [1] andinfertility beset around 80 million people worldwide bycausing considerable psychological and financial burden. Itis estimated that male reproductive dysfunction contributesto about half of infertile couples [2, 3]. Male infertilitycould be caused by various reasons, for instance, failurein spermatogenesis, epididymal maturation or storage ofsperm, abnormal sperm delivery or accessory gland function,genetic or environmental factors, and sexual disorders [4, 5].Among these causes, defects in spermatogenesis are the mostcommon and account for 20%\u201325% of cases [6].Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of thetestis with the seminiferous epithelium containing the devel-oping germ cells and somatic Sertoli cells. Spermatogenesisis a continuous process by which the haploid germ cells areproduced from differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells(SSCs) through mitosis and meiosis [7]. SSCs are respon-sible for sustaining fertility by tightly balancing betweenself-renewal and differentiation. With the establishment ofbalance, sperms are produced continually throughout thelifespan of an adult male [8\u201310]. Increased differentiation ofSSCs at cost of self-renewal which destroys the balance wouldlead to male sterility [6]. Oct-4 and Plzf are considered to beresponsible for preserving the pluripotency and self-renewalof stem cells [11, 12]. They are generally accepted as stem cellmarkers as they are downregulated during differentiation.Self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs are strictly regu-lated by a combination of extrinsic gene signals from theniche as well as intrinsic signal pathways. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), secreted by Sertolicells, is specifically responsible for the maintenance andself-renewal of SSCs [13, 14]. By binding to glycosylphosphati-dylinositol- (GPI-) anchored cell surface molecule (Gfr\ud835\udefc1),Gdnf is able to trigger PI3K/AKT pathway and eventuallylead to self-renewal of SSCs [15, 16]. It has already beendemonstrated that abnormal expression of extrinsic or intrin-sic signaling molecules can give rise to impaired sper-matogenesis [17, 18]. Oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia,Hindawi Publishing CorporationEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineVolume 2014, Article ID 640857, 9 pageshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/640857http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/6408572 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicineteratozoospermia, and azoospermia are the most commonclinical manifestation of male infertility resulting fromimpaired spermatogenesis. In these cases, signal pathwaysregulating SSCs, such as PI3K/AKT pathway [19], are likelyto be disrupted, thereby self-renewal of SSCs decreased andmale infertility occurred.The Yangjing Capsule (YC), which is composed of HerbaEpimedii Brevicornus, Placenta Hominis, Rhizoma PolygonatiSibirici, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata, Angelica sinensis, andother components, has been suggested for the treatmentof diseases of the reproductive system [20, 21]. Our pre-vious clinical study found that YC was very effective foroligospermatism and can markedly increase sperm densityfor patients with a sperm density of over 5 \u00d7 106/mL [22].While medical practice has proved the efficacy of Chineseherbal formulation, the underlying molecular mechanismsof YC improving male fertility remain elusive. Our presentstudy is aimed to determine whether YC could promote self-renewal of SSCs and explore the targeted signal pathwaysinvolved.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Chemicals. Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle\u2019s medium(DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and lyophilized trypsin-EDTA were obtained from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, NY,USA). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium dode-cyl sulfate (SDS), and Tris/HCl were purchased from Sigma(St. Louis, MO, USA). The whole protein extraction kitswere purchased from Keygen (Keygen Biotech. Co. Ltd.,Nanjing, China). Trizol reagent, PrimeScript RT MasterMix, and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent kits wereobtained from TaKaRa (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian,China). The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen LifeTech (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Rabbit monoclonal anti-AKT(phospho S473), rabbit polyclonal anti-Plzf ab38739, andanti-Oct-4 ab18976 were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,USA). Mouse monoclonal anti-\ud835\udefd-actin was from Chemicon(Temecula, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescencewas obtainedfrom Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).2.2. Preparation of YC Extract. The YC is composed of 11 tra-ditional Chinese drugs: 13.3% Yinyanghuo (Herba EpimediiBrevicornus), 13.3% Muli (Concha Ostreae (calcined)), 13.3%Wangbuliuxing (Semen Vaccariae Segetalis), 10% Huangqi(Radix Astragali Mongolici), 10% Danggui (Radix AngelicaeSinensis), 6.7% Huangjing (Rhizoma Polygonati Sibirici),6.7% Shayuanzi (Semen Astragali Complanati), 6.7% Ziheche(Placenta Hominis), 6.7% Shudihuang (Radix RehmanniaePreparata), 6.7% Lizhihe (Semen Litchi), and 6.7% Shuizhi(Hirudo).The YC extract was prepared based on themethodsdescribed byKao et al. [23].The content of the YC (equivalentto 10 g of crude drug) was extracted with distilled water andsubsequently subjected to ultrasonic extraction for 45min.The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 gand 4\u2218C for 30min to collect the supernatant, which wasconcentrated to 100mL with a rotary evaporator at 60\u2218C.The final concentration of the YC extract corresponded to100mg/mL of the crude herbal dose. The pH of the extractwas adjusted to 7.0, and the extract was sterilized by filtrationand stored at \u221280\u2218C until use.2.3. siRNATransfection and PI3K Inhibition of GC-1 Spg Cells.GC-1 spg cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with10% FBS, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 \ud835\udf07g/mL streptomycin,and then incubated in a 5% CO2incubator (Thermo FisherScientific, Rochester, USA) at 37\u2218C. For determining effectsof YC extract on the self-renewal, GC-1 spg cells were treatedwith 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YC extract and 20 ng/mL Gdnf(used as positive control), respectively. After 48 h, cells werecollected for assay of proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.RNAs and protein were prepared to detect the expressionof Plzf and Oct-4 by quantitative PCR and western blot.To explore the underlying mechanism, Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdownand PI3K inhibition were performed. For Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown,19-nucleotide siRNA sequences (sense: 5\udba0\udc20-GCC CUC ACAGGC UUC UGU U-3\udba0\udc20 and antisense: 3\udba0\udc20-CGG GAG UGUCCG AAG ACA A-5\udba0\udc20) targeting mouse Gfr\ud835\udefc1 sequence(GCC CTC ACA GGC TTC TGT T) were designed usingBLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) and synthesized byInvitrogen [24]. The Stealth RNAi negative control obtainedfrom Invitrogen was used as a control for monitoringnonsequence-specific effects. 50 pmol Stealth RNAi negativecontrol and Gfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNA were transfected into GC-1 spgcells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instruction. At 48 h after transfection, cellswere treated with 1mg/mL YC extract for 48 h and collectedfor proliferation assay, quantitative PCR, and western blot.For PI3K inhibition, GC-1 spg cells were exposed by 50 \ud835\udf07MLY294002 (targeting the ATP-binding site of the PI3K) forabrogating PI3K activation. 2 h later, 1mg/mL YC extractwas added and cells were collected for proliferation assay,quantitative PCR, and western blot.2.4. MTT Assay of Cell Proliferation. Cells were seeded in 96-well plate for 48 h treatment of 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YCextract, 20 ng/mLGdnf, 50\ud835\udf07MLY294002, and 50 pmolGfr\ud835\udefc1siRNA, respectively (\ud835\udc5b = 5). MTT (5mg/mL) was added with20\ud835\udf07L to each well and incubated for another 4 h before it wasdiscarded. Then the purple-blue MTT formazan precipitatewas dissolved in 100\ud835\udf07L dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Theabsorbance (OD) was measured at 490 nm.The proliferationratio was calculated by the following formula: proliferationratio (%) = (average ODtreatment group/average ODcontrol group \u22121) \u00d7 100%.2.5. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assay. Cells were incubated in6-well plates for 48 h treatment. Then cells were digestedand washed. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were measuredwith flow cytometer (BD, Franklin, NJ, USA) according tothe instructions of the Cycletest Plus DNA assay kit andAnnexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit, respectively.Thepercentages of cells in G0/G1 phase, S phase, andG2/M phasewere evaluated by the ModFit software (BD, Franklin, NJ,USA). The percentages of early stage and late stage apoptosiswere evaluated with CellQuest software (BD, Franklin, NJ,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3USA). Total apoptosis rate was equal to early stage apoptosisplus late stage apoptosis.2.6. RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR. Cells at a density of4\u00d7 105/well were plated in 6-well plates for 48 h treatment.The total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent, measuredby spectrometry at an OD260/280, and reverse transcribedinto cDNA in a total volume of 20\ud835\udf07L with PrimeScript RTMaster Mix. All of the RT-PCR reactions were performedwith a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,Hercules, CA) using SYBR Green chemistry (Bio-Rad Lab-oratories). GAPDH was selected as the control. The primersequenceswere as follows:GAPDH, sense: 5\udba0\udc20-AGGTTGTCTCCT GCG ACT TCA-3\udba0\udc20 and antisense: 5\udba0\udc20-GGG TGG TCCAGG GTT TCT TAC T-3\udba0\udc20; Plzf, sense: 5\udba0\udc20-CAC ACA GGCAGA CCC ATA CT-3\udba0\udc20 and antisense: 5\udba0\udc20-TTT GTG GCTCTT GAG TGT GC-3\udba0\udc20; OCT-4, sense: 5\udba0\udc20-CTT GCT GCAGAA GTG GGT GGA GGA A-3\udba0\udc20 and antisense: 5\udba0\udc20-CTGCAG TGT GGG TTT CGG GCA-3\udba0\udc20 [25, 26]. The reactionswere performed at 94\u2218C for 3min followed by 40 cycles at94\u2218C for 30 s, 55\u2218C for 30 s, and 72\u2218C for 30 s. The finalextension was carried out for 5min at 72\u2218C. A melting curveanalysis was performed to confirm the products. The relativeabundances of the target mRNAs were calculated using the2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method. The data were expressed as the percentage ofcontrol (100%).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis. Cells wereseeded in 60mm dishes at a density of 1 \u00d7 106/well for48 h treatment. The cells were harvested, washed three timeswith precooled PBS, and treated with cell lysis buffer forwestern blot analysis. After centrifugation at 12.000 g at 4\u2218Cfor 20min, the supernatants were collected and stored at\u221280\u2218C until analysis.The concentrations of protein were measured by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).The proteins were normalized to 50 \ud835\udf07g/lane, separated by 12%sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(SDS-PAGE), and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulosemembranes. After treatment with blocking solution (5%skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline) at 37\u2218C for 1 h,the membranes were incubated overnight with the primaryantibodies rabbit monoclonal anti-pAKT (1 : 5000), rabbitpolyclonal anti-Plzf (1 : 500), rabbit polyclonal anti-Oct-4(1 : 400), or mouse monoclonal anti-\ud835\udefd-actin (1 : 5000) at 4\u2218C.After washing with TBS three times, the membranes wereincubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) at 37\u2218C for 1 h and examined using enhanced chemi-luminescence. The relative protein levels in each samplewere normalized to the levels of \ud835\udefd-actin to standardize thevariations in loading. Densitometric analyses of the scannedimmunoblotting images were performed using a QuantityOne image system. The data are expressed as a percentage ofthe control (100%).2.8. Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed using a SPSS16.0 statistical package. All results were expressed as mean \u00b1standard deviation (S.D.).

Results3.1. Effects of YC Extract on Proliferation of GC-1 Spg Cells.The effects of YC extract on cell proliferation are shown inFigure 1. Gdnf, responsible for proliferation of SSCs, was usedas positive control. In the presence of 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mLYC extract for 48 h, OD values increased in a dose dependentmanner.The proliferation rates of GC-1 spg cells increased by13.38%, 32.47%, and 46.04%, respectively. In the presence of20 ng/mL Gdnf for 48 h, the proliferation rates of GC-1 spgcells significantly increased by 47.98%. There are no evidentchanges observed with the treatment of 50\ud835\udf07M LY294002 or50 pmol Gfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNA.3.2. Effects of YC Extract on Cell Cycle of GC-1 Spg Cells.Results of cell cycle assay of GC-1 spg cells are shown inFigure 2. The percentage of S phase in control group was30.52% (Figure 2(a)), and after 48 h treatment of differentdoses of YC extract, the percentage of S phase evidently roseto 37.45%, 41.47%, and 46.30%, respectively (Figures 2(b),2(c), and 2(d)). A decline of percentage of G0/G1 phase wasalso observed. These data suggested that YC extract couldadvance the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase andpromote proliferation of spg cells.3.3. Effects of YC Extract on Apoptosis of GC-1 Spg Cells. Asshown in Figure 3, total apoptosis rate was equal to early stageapoptosis (LR) plus late stage apoptosis (UR).

However, 0.1 and 1mg/mL YC extract notablyinhibited cell apoptosis.3.4. Effects of the YCExtract on the Expression ofOct-4 andPlzfmRNAs and Proteins. Oct-4 and Plzf were chosen as stemcell markers to confirm the undifferentiated status of GC-1spg cells. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) showed that the expressionof Oct-4 and Plzf mRNAs increased significantly by exposureof 0.1, 1mg/mL YC extract and 20 ng/mL Gdnf. Accordingly,Figure 4(c) showed that the expression of Oct-4 and Plzfproteins increased evidently at the same condition.The resultsuggested that YC extract could promote self-renewal of GC-1spg cells.3.5. Gfr\ud835\udefc1 Knockdown or PI3K Inhibition Blocks YC ExtractInduced Proliferation of GC-1 Spg Cells. To investigate themechanism of YC extract induced proliferation of GC-1 spgcells, Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown and PI3K inhibitionwere performed.As shown in Figure 5, YC extract significantly stimulated thecell proliferation.However, bothGfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNA and LY294002,an inhibitor of PI3K, could evidently abrogate the stimulativeeffect of YC extract.3.6. Gfr\ud835\udefc1 Knockdown or PI3K Inhibition Blocks YC ExtractInduced Upregulation of Oct-4 and Plzf Expression. Theresults of Figure 6 showed that both Gfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNA andLY294002 could abolish the upregulation of Oct-4 and Plzfexpression at levels of mRNA and protein induced by YCextract.Meanwhile, upregulation of pAKTprotein expressioninduced by YC extract, evidence for PI3K pathway activa-tion, was also suppressed by Gfr\ud835\udefc1 siRNA and LY294002.Combined with the results above, it could be inferred thatEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5PI104103102101100Annexin V FITC100101102103104QuadULURLLLRGated (%)0.135.7190.193.97(a)PI104103102101100Annexin V FITC100101102103104ULURLLLRQuad0.155.4190.913.54Gated (%)(b)PI104103102101100Annexin V FITC100101102103104ULURLLLRQuad0.141.6394.563.68Gated (%)(c)PI104103102101100Annexin V FITC100101102103104ULURLLLRQuad0.010.6697.611.72Gated (%)(d)Figure 3: Effects of YC extract on apoptosis of GC-1 spg cells.

The analysis was performed in triplicate and representative data was shown.Gfr\ud835\udefc1 and PI3K played crucial roles in the promotion of self-renewal induced by YC extract.4. DiscussionYC extract has been used for male infertility therapy inclinic for years, but the mechanisms still remain unclear. Ourresults suggested that YC extract could stimulate self-renewalof SSCs and protect SSCs from apoptosis, thus improvingspermatogenesis.Oct-4 is considered to be the master transcription factorresponsible for preserving the pluripotency and self-renewalof stem cells [11, 25]. It is downregulated during differentia-tion with loss of pluripotency [27\u201329] and generally acceptedas a stem cell marker. Plzf has also drawn wide attentiondue to its role of regulating differentiation. Plzf is claimedto be essential for maintaining pluripotent properties andself-renewal as its expression is confined to stem cells andearly progenitor cells [12, 30, 31]. While Plzf is expressedat high level in undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, itsexpression declined when differentiation started. Our resultsshowed that 48 h treatment of YC extract not only promotedthe proliferation of GC-1 spg cells but also promoted self-renewal of cells proved by enhanced expression of Oct-4 andPlzf mRNAs and proteins, which were quite similar to theeffect of Gdnf treatment (Figures 1 and 4). As a matter ofcourse, we deduced that YC extract probably functioned inthe similar ways as Gdnf.Gdnf, secreted by Sertoli cells, is so far the only knownparacrine factor specifically responsible for the maintenanceand self-renewal of SSCs in vivo [13, 14]. Lin et al. reportedthat Gdnf is a member of the transforming growth fac-tor beta (TGF-\ud835\udefd) superfamily [32]. Gdnf signals througha multicomponent receptor complex are composed of theRet receptor tyrosine kinase and Gfr\ud835\udefc1 [33, 34]. Gdnf cantrigger various downstream signal pathways to promote cellsurvival and self-renewal via GPI-linked protein Gfr\ud835\udefc1 [35,36].

To confirm our hypothesis,we used siRNA to knockdown Gfr\ud835\udefc1 expression in currentresearch. Figure 5 showed that Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown almostentirely abolished the proliferous effect of GC-1 cells inducedby YC extract. Corresponding with this, Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdownalso abrogated the elevated expression of Oct-4 and PlzfmRNAs and proteins induced by YC extract (Figure 6). Onthe basis of these results, we inferred that YC extract exertsbiological effects partly via Gfr\ud835\udefc1.To further investigate the mechanism of YC extract, wetreated GC-1 cells with 50\ud835\udf07M LY294002 to inhibit PI3Kpathway before the treatment of YC extract. PI3Kpathwayhasbeen demonstrated to play a central role in the Gdnf inducedself-renewal of SSCs [37, 38]. The binding of Gdnf to Gfr\ud835\udefc1triggers phosphorylation of SRC-kinase family proteins fol-lowed by activation of PI3K/AKT pathway and eventuallyleads to self-renewal of SSCs via expression ofN-myc gene [15,16]. As has been stated, likeGdnf, YC extract also induces self-renewal via Gfr\ud835\udefc1, and activation of PI3K pathway is mostlikely very crucial in YC extract\u2019s effects. As expected, pAKTprotein expression increased evidently after treatment of YCextract standing for PI3K pathway activation (Figure 6). PI3Kpathway inhibition evidently removed the proliferous effectof GC-1 spg cells induced by YC extract which was shownin Figure 5. Consistent with this, the upregulated Oct-4 andPlzf mRNAs and proteins also dropped down by LY294002treatment (Figure 6).In summary, YC extract could improve spermatogenesisby means of promoting self-renewal of SSCs and protectingSSCs from apoptosis, which were verified by cell proliferationand upregulation of OCT-4 and Plzf expression after theEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 702468101214Oct-4/GAPDH mRNA (fold of control)\u25b3\u25b3\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 ##ConYC extractYC extract+LY294002YC extract+Con siRNAYC extract+Gfra1siRNA(a)0246810121416Plzf/GAPDH mRNA (fold of control) \u25b3\u25b3\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 ##ConYC extractYC extract+LY294002YC extract+Con siRNAYC extract+Gfra1siRNA(b)pAKTOct-4Plzf\ud835\udefd-ActinConYC extractYC extract+LY294002YC extract+Con siRNAYC extract+Gfra1siRNA(c)Figure 6: Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown or PI3 K inhibition blocks YC extract induced upregulation ofOct-4 and Plzf expression.

To explore possible mechanism,we performed Gfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown and PI3K inhibition beforeapplication of YC extract. The results showed that bothGfr\ud835\udefc1 knockdown and PI3K inhibition were able to evidentlyremove the cell proliferation and upregulation of OCT-4and Plzf expression induced by YC extract. Therefore, weconcluded that, partly via Gfr\ud835\udefc1, YC extract could triggerthe activation of PI3K pathway and finally lead to self-renewal of SSCs. However, as YC extract is composed ofmultiple components, further studies are needed to identifythe primary effective component.Conflict of InterestsThere is no conflict of interests regarding the publication ofthis paper.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Chinese National NaturalScience Foundation (no. 81273760, no. 81302969) and aPostgraduate Innovation Program of the Jiangsu ProvinceEducationDepartment (no.
