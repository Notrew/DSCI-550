"Loss of plakoglobin promotes decreased cell-cell contact, increased invasion, and breast cancer cell dissemination in vivoRESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessLoss of plakoglobin promotes decreased cell-cellcontact, increased invasion, and breast cancercell dissemination in vivoIngunn Holen1, Jacob Whitworth1, Faith Nutter1, Alyson Evans1, Hannah K Brown1, Diane V Lefley1, Ivana Barbaric2,Mark Jones2 and Penelope D Ottewell1*AbstractIntroduction: The majority of deaths from breast cancer are a result of metastases; however, little is understoodabout the genetic alterations underlying their onset. Genetic profiling has identified the adhesion moleculeplakoglobin as being three-fold reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have metastasized comparedwith nonmetastatic tumors. In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for plakoglobin in the shedding oftumor cells from the primary site into the circulation.Methods: We investigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration,adhesion, and invasion in vitro and on tumor growth and intravasation in vivo. MCF7 and T47D cells were stablytransfected with miRNA sequences targeting the plakoglobin gene, or scramble vector. Gene and proteinexpression was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Cell proliferation,adhesion, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting, flow cytometry, and scratch and BoydenChamber assays. For in vivo experiments, plakoglobin knockdown and control cells were inoculated into mammaryfat pads of mice, and tumor growth, shedding of tumor cells into the bloodstream, and evidence of metastaticbone lesions were monitored with caliper measurement, flow cytometry, and microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT),respectively.Results: Plakoglobin and g-catenin expression were reduced by more than 80% in all knockdown cell lines usedbut were unaltered after transfection with the scrambled sequence. Reduced plakoglobin resulted in significantlyincreased in MCF7 and T47D cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, compared with control, with significantly moretumor cells being shed into the bloodstream of mice bearing plakoglobin knockdown tumors. In addition,plakoglobin knockdown cells showed a >250% increase in invasion through basement membrane and exhibitedreduced cell-to-cell adhesion compared with control cells.Conclusion: Decreased plakoglobin expression increases the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. This is the firstdemonstration of a functional role for plakoglobin/g-catenin in the metastatic process, indicating that this moleculemay represent a target for antimetastatic therapies.IntroductionBreast cancer is a highly metastatic disease, and oncemetastases are established, this condition becomesincurable. In 65% to 75% of patients with advancedbreast cancer, skeletal involvement is present, withmedian survival rates of approximately 2 years afterinitial diagnosis of bone metastasis [1]. However, little isunderstood about the genetic alterations that areresponsible for changing a nonmetastatic tumor into atumor with a metastatic phenotype. Identification ofthese genes and their functional significance is thereforeessential for the development of novel therapeuticregimens.* Correspondence: P.D.Ottewell@sheffield.ac.uk1Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, University of Sheffield, Medical School,Beech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX, UKFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleHolen et al.

Furthermore, expression ofplakoglobin is reduced on autocrine production ofhuman growth hormone, which is associated withincreased breast tumor cell invasion in vivo [3]. Plako-globin resides on the same locus as the BRCA1 gene,17q12-17q21, and patients showing loss of heterozygos-ity of BRCA1 also show loss of heterozygosity of plako-globin [4,5]. Patients with this mutation have an 80%chance of developing breast cancer, further suggesting arole for plakoglobin in the etiology of breast cancer [6].For metastases to develop, tumor cells must firstacquire a motile phenotype and migrate toward thebasement membrane. Breakdown of the extracellularmatrix then allows the cells to invade the surroundingtissue and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system.Once in the circulation, cells must evade the hostimmune system before exiting the vasculature byadhering to the endothelium of the target site. Finally,tumor cells implant at a secondary site, forming ametastases [7]. Therefore, genetic alterations that leadto disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactionsmay play a role in the initiation of cancer metastases,facilitating tumor-cell dissemination from the primarysite into the circulation.Plakoglobin encodes for the cell-adhesion protein g-catenin [8,9]. In conjunction with b-catenin, g-cateninlinks e-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, forming inter-cellular cadherin-catenin complexes, a key part of theextracellular matrix [10]. In this study, we aimed toestablish whether plakoglobin has a functional role inthe metastatic cascade in breast cancer. We investigatedthe effects of reducing plakoglobin expression on theinvasive properties of breast cancer cells by usingmiRNA technology. We have designed small ssRNAsequences of approximately 22 nucleotides in lengththat trigger gene silencing through specific cleavage andRNA degradation to target plakoglobin exclusively[11,12]. We compared the effects of reduced plakoglobinexpression in weakly metastatic MCF7 and nonmeta-static T47D breast cancer cells on growth, adhesion,migration, and invasion in vitro [13-16]. In addition, weanalyzed tumor growth and intravasation from themouse mammary fat pad into the circulation in vivo.Our data show that loss of plakoglobin promotes theprometastatic phenotype of breast cancer cells, indicat-ing that this molecule may be a potential prognostic fac-tor of increased risk of cancer progression as well as atherapeutic target.Materials and methodsGeneration of plakoglobin knockdown cell linesPre-miRNA expression cassettes were designed to targetthe plakoglobin gene by using the BLOCK-iT Pol II miRRNAi Expression vector kits and manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. In brief, complementary DNA oligos containingfour-nucleotide overhangs were designed by using theRNAi Designer online tool (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,USA) and synthesised by using the following primerpairs: 2 = Forward (5\u2019 to 3\u2019): TGC TGA TGA GATGCA CAA TGG CCG ACG TTT TGG CCA CTG ACTGAC GTC GGC CAG TGC ATC TCA T Reverse (5\u2019 to3\u2019): CCT GAT GAG ATG CAC TGG CCG ACG TCAGTC AGT GGC CAA AAC GTC GGC CAT TGTGCA TCT CAT C. 3 = Forward (5\u2019 to 3\u2019): TGC TGATTG CTG GGA CAC ACG GAT AGG TTT TGGCCA CTG ACT GAC CTA TCC GTG TCC CAG CAAT Reverse (5\u2019 to 3\u2019): CCT GAT TGC TGG GAC ACGGAT AGG TCA GTC AGT GGC CAA AAC CTATCC GTG TGT CCC AGC AAT C. Double-strandedoligos were then cloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR expression vectors by using T4 DNA Ligase beforebeing transformed into One Shot TOP10 CompetentEscherichia coli. Transformed E. coli was plated onto LBagar, Miller (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) containing 100\u03bcg/ml nucleoside antibiotic (Blasticidin; Invitrogen). Tocheck accuracy of cloning and transformation DNAfrom five individual Blasticidin-resistant colonies peroriginal double-stranded oligo was purified by usingPureLink HQ Mini Plasmid purification Kit (Invitrogen),sequenced in house by using the random shotgunmethod by the Genomics core facility, University ofSheffield, as previously described; data were analyzed byusing Finch TV software and data cross referenced tothe plakoglobin sequence on Genbank [Genbank:AC000149] [17,18]. To enable lentiviral transfection, thepre-miRNA expression cassettes were then transferredto pLenti6/V5-DST destination vector (as described inBLOCK-iT Lentiviral PolII miRNAi Expression Systemmanual, available online) [19]. Pre-miRNA cassettes andViraPower (Invitrogen) were co-transfected into a293FT donor cell line by using Lipofectamine 2000(Invitrogen) to produce a replication-incompetent lenti-virus. Lentivirus containing pre-miRNA cassettes orcontrol (scramble miRNA sequence) were used to trans-duce the human breast cancer cell lines T47D andMCF7 to produce three plakoglobin-knockdown andcontrol cell lines.Real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen), beforereverse transcription by using superscript III (Invitrogen);the resulting cDNA was used as a template for real-timeHolen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86Page 2 of 14quantitative PCR. Cells from three separate in vitroexperiments or five tumors per in vivo group were ana-lyzed separately. Relative mRNA expression of plakoglo-bin (Hs00984034_m1; Applied Biosystems), e-Cadherin(Hs1013953_m1), or NM23-H1 (Hs00264824_m1) werecompared with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Hs99999905_m1) byusing an ABI 7900 PCR system (Perkin-Elmer, AppliedBiosystems) and Taqman universal master mix (AppliedBiosystems). Relative mRNA was determined by usingthe formula 2-\u0394CT (CT; cycle threshold) where \u0394CT =CT (target gene) - CT (GAPDH).Western blottingProtein was extracted from pooled cells from threeseparate in vitro experiments and tumor samples fromindividual mice by using a Mammalian cell lysis kit(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). Ten micrograms of proteinwas run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferredonto an imibilon-P nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore).Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% casein (VectorLaboratories) before incubation with mouse monoclonalantibodies specific for gamma-catenin [15F11] (1:500),e-cadherin [HECD-1] (1:1,000), or GAPDH [6C5](1:1,000) for 16 hours at 4\u00b0C (all primary antibodieswere from AbCam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibodywas sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP;1:15,000), and HRP was detected with the Supersignalchemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Band quantifi-cation was carried out by using Quantity One software(Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and normalized toRNA polymerase.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry was performed on 4% formalin-fixed cells grown on chamber slides. Primary antibodiesrabbit anti-g catenin (2309s, 1:500 dilution; New EnglandBiolabs), rat anti-e-cadherin (DECMA-1, 1:50; AbCam),and rabbit anti- b-catenin (E247, 1:50; AbCam). Cells weresubsequently incubated with biotin anti-rabbit (for g-cate-nin and b-catenin at 1:100) and biotin anti-ray (for e-cad-herin at 1:100). Visualization followed incubation withfluorescence avidin (Vector A-2001) at 1:250.nalysis of prometastatic parameters in vitroAll cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemen-ted with 10% FCS (Gibco Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and50 mg/ml blasticidin, 24 hours before experimental proto-col cells were transferred to RMPI-1640 supplementedwith 10% FCS in the absence of blasticidin. All experi-ments were carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 times.Cell proliferation was monitored every 24 hours for96 hours by cell counting with a 1/400 mm2 hemocyt-ometer (Hawksley, Lancing, UK), and a sample of cellswas taken at each time point for Western blotting and rt-PCR to check the stability of the siRNA knockdown.Cell-cell adhesion was monitored by using two meth-ods: (a) the ability of cells to form three-dimensionalspheroids after seeding of 2,000 cells into a semisolidmedium. Medium consisted of 1.5% agarose (Invitrogen)in RPMI media supplemented with 1% fungizone(Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).The spheroid area was calculated 10 and 21 days afterseeding by using ImageJ software (ImageJ v1.44;National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA); and(b) the ability of cells to bind to a confluent monolayerof the corresponding cell type; cells were cultured toform a confluent monolayer, and 20,000 cells of thesame type (plakoglobin knockdown or control) werelabeled with 1 nM DiD (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes)for 30 minutes in serum-free media before being seededonto the equivalent confluent cells. Two hours after co-culture, media containing floating cells were discarded,and adherent cells were trypsinized. The number ofDiD-labeled cells that had adhered to nonlabeled cells ofthe same cell type was analyzed at 644 nM with flowcytometry.Tumor cell invasion was assessed by using 6-mmTranswell plates with an 8.0-\u03bcm pore size (Costar;Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) eitheruncoated or coated with basement membrane matrix(Matrigel; Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into the innerchamber at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 105 and 5 \u00d7 105 per assayin RPMI without FCS, and RPMI supplemented withFCS was added to the outer chamber. Twenty-fourhours after seeding, cells were removed from the topsurface of the membrane, and cells that had invadedthrough the pores were stained with hematoxylin andeosin. Invasion was calculated as the percentage of cellsthat invaded through basement membrane comparedwith cells that had moved to the underside of uncoatedplates. Numbers of cells were counted by using a DMRBmicroscope (Leitz, Germany) and OsteoMeasure XPv1.2.0.1 program (Osteometrics, Decatur, GA, USA).Migration of tumor cells was investigated by analyzingwound closure: Cells were seeded onto 0.2% gelatin;once confluent, 10 \u00b5g/ml mitomycin C was added, anda 50-\u03bcm scratch made across the monolayer. The per-centage of wound closure was measured at 24, 48, and72 hours. To monitor migration of individual tumorcells, a 50-\u03bcm scratch was made across the monolayerof confluent cells. Images were taken every hour for72 hours by time-lapse microscopy by using a CTR7000inverted microscope; images were captured by usingLAS-AF v2.1.1 software (Leica Applications Suite; LeicaMicrosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and analyzed by Ima-geJ software (ImageJ v1.44; National Institutes ofHealth).Holen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86Page 3 of 14Effects of altered reduced plakoglobin expression ontumor growth and metastases in vivoAnalysis of tumor growth in vivo17b estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America)were implanted subcutaneously into 50, 11-week-oldfemale balb/c nu/nu mice (Harlan, Shardlow, UK). Sevendays after the pellet had been implanted, 1 \u00d7 105 MCF73c-3 or control cells (n =15 per group) or 1 \u00d7 105 T47D2A-4 or control cells (n = 10 per group) in 20 \u03bcl (33%Matrigel: 66% PBS) were inoculated into the fifth and 10thmammary fat pads. Tumor volume was measured twiceper week by using calipers. For differences in tumorgrowth, 10 mice per group were culled by cervical disloca-tion 32 or 34 days after tumor cell implantation. For analy-sis of circulating tumor cells, five mice per group bearingMCF7 3c-3 or control cells were culled once tumors wereof equal size (1 cm3 ). Tumors were placed in cell-lysisbuffer (MCL-1KT mammalian cell-lysis kit (Sigma, Poole,UK)), and protein was extracted according to the manu-facturer\u2019s instructions. Experiments were carried out withUK Home Office approval under project license 40/2343.Isolation of circulating tumor cellsWhole blood was analyzed from five mice per group bear-ing 1-cm3 tumors from MCF7 3C-3 or control cells.Whole blood from three na\u00efve mice and parental MCF7cells were used for staining controls by using the protocoldescribed in Ottewell et al. [20], with the exception thatthe primary antibody used was anti-human EpCAM anti-body directly conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) (Clone1B7; 1:50; eBioscience, Hatfield, UK). PE-positive cellswere plated directly into a 96-well tissue-culture plate(one well per group) (Nunc, Rochester, UK) on a MoFlowHigh performance cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Cam-bridge, UK). PE fluorescence was detected with a 555LPdichroic long-pass and a 580/30-nm band-pass filter.Acquisition and analysis of cells was performed by usingSummit 4.3 software. After sorting, cells were cultured inRPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS.Microcomputed tomography imagingMicrocomputed tomography analysis of tibiae and femurswere carried out by using a Skyscan 1172 x-ray-computedmicrotomograph (Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium) equippedwith an x-ray tube (voltage, 49 kV; current, 200 \u03bcA) and a0.5-mm aluminum filter. Pixel size was set to 4.37 \u03bcm, andscanning was initiated from the top of the proximal tibiaor the distal femur. For each sample, 275 cross-sectionalimages were reconstructed with NRecon software (version1.4.3, Skyscan). After reconstruction, the volume of inter-est was defined on the two-dimensional acquisition imagesby using a hand-drawing tool. Trabecular bone volumefraction (BV/TV), the ratio of the volume of bone present(BV) to the volume of the cancellous space (TV), wascalculated for 1 mm of the bone, starting 0.2 mm from thegrowth plate. 3D modeling and analysis were performedby using CTAn (version 1.5.0.2) and CTvol (version1.9.4.1) software (Skyscan).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out by using analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett two-sidedmultiple comparison test. All P values are two-sided.ResultsPlakoglobin expression in parental cell linesThe main aim of this study was to investigate whetherexpression of the cell-adhesion molecule plakoglobinplays a role in the dissemination of breast cancer cellsinto the circulation. We first compared the expression ofplakoglobin in weakly metastatic MCF7, nonmetastaticT47D, and highly metastatic HeLa, MDA-MB-436, andMDA-MB-231 cell lines [13-16,21-24]. Real-time PCRanalysis showed significantly higher levels of plakoglobinin MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells compared withHeLa, MDA-MB-231, or MDA-MB-426 (P < 0.0001 forT47D cells and P < 0.005 for MCF7 cells compared withHeLa, MDA-MB-231, or MDA-436) (Figure 1A).Furthermore, significantly higher levels of plakoglobinwere detected in T47D cells compared with MCF7 (P <0.005). In all cell lines tested, plakoglobin gene expressioncorrelated with g-catenin protein expression (Figure 1C).The protein product of plakoglobin, g-catenin, com-plexes with e-cadherin to form intercellular bonds; wetherefore examined the gene and protein expression of e-cadherin in the highly metastatic versus weakly and non-metastatic cell lines. Real-time PCR and Western blotanalysis showed high levels of e-cadherin in T47D andMCF7 cells, whereas this gene was undetectable in HeLa,MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-436 cells (Figure 1B).Similar to plakoglobin expression, significantly less e-cad-herin was detected in MCF7 cells compared with T47D(P < 0.005). As both plakoglobin and e-cadherin weredetectable in MCF7 and T47D cells, these cell lines wereselected as models for investigating the effects of reducedplakoglobin on parameters associated with metastasesafter targeted miRNA knockdown.Effects of miRNA transfection on plakoglobin expressionTo produce T47D and MCF7 cells with reduced levelsof plakoglobin, pre-miRNA expression cassettes weredesigned to target the plakoglobin gene, and controlcells were produced by using scramble sequence. Pre-miRNA cassettes were transfected into MCF7 and T47Dcells, and six clones from each transfection were testedfor plakoglobin expression. Transfection with scramblesequence had no effect on plakoglobin expression;Holen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86Page 4 of 14however, transfection with miRNA 2 resulted in a 58%to 81% reduction in plakoglobin expression in MCF7cells (Figure 2A) and a 0 to 90% reduction in expressionin T47D cells (Figure 2C). Transfection miRNA cassette3 resulted in a 55% to 83% reduction in plakoglobinexpression in MCF7 cells (Figure 2B). MCF7 clone 2A-1from cassette 2 and clone 3C-3 from cassette 3 showeda >80% reduction in plakoglobin, and T47D clone 2A-1showed a 90% reduction in plakoglobin compared withscramble sequence; therefore, these clones were selectedfor use in the subsequent experiments. In all cases, thereduction in plakoglobin expression was translated intoreduced g-catenin levels (Figure 1D), with high levels ofg-catenin detected on the cell membrane of controlMCF7 and T47D cells and reduced staining detected onthe cell membranes of plakoglobin-knockdown cell lines(T47D cells shown in Figure 1E).Real-time PCR analysis showed that knockdown of pla-koglobin had no effect on total e-cadherin (Figure 2A, B,C). However, protein levels were decreased by 6% inMCF7 2A-1 and 6.5% in 3C-3 cells, whereas e-cadherinwas increased by 13% in T47D 2A-4 cells, when normal-ized to RNA polymerase, compared with control (Figure2D). Importantly, knockdown of plakoglobin resulted inthe translocation of the cell-cell adhesion proteins e-cad-herin and b-catenin from the cell membrane into thenucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2E).Reduced expression of plakoglobin increases proliferationReduced expression of plakoglobin resulted in a signifi-cant increase in proliferation of both MCF7 and T47Dcells. In MCF7 cells a >80% reduction in plakoglobin ledto a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation at 72 hours and athreefold increase at 96 hours compared with scramblesequence, with no significant difference between miRNAclones detected (P < 0.005 at 72 hours and P < 0.001 at96 hours for 2A-1 and 3C-3) (Figure 3A). In T47D cellsin which plakoglobin expression was reduced by 90%,proliferation was further increased with a twofoldincrease in numbers of cells at 48 hours (P < 0.005), athreefold increase at 72 hours (P < 0.005) and a fourfoldincrease at 96 hours (P < 0.0001) compared with control(Figure 3B). Furthermore, T47D 2A-4 cells showed sig-nificantly increased proliferation compared with controlthan did MCF7 2A-1 or 3C-3 clones (P < 0.005).To ensure that miRNA knockdown was stable overtime, the levels of plakoglobin in tumor cells were ana-lyzed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours for each cell-prolifera-tion study. Figure 1C and 1D show that plakoglobin isconstitutively reduced in MCF7 and T47D miRNAknockdown cells compared with control, and these cellswere used in the subsequent experiments.MCF7T47DHeLaMDA-231Gamma cateninE-cadherinRNA polymeraseA)B)C)Figure 1 Comparative expression of adhesion molecules .Relative expression of (A) plakoglobin and (B) e-cadherin comparedwith GAPDH \u00b1 SEM for T47D, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, andMCF7 cells, as assessed with real-time PCR.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86Page 7 of 14Reduced plakoglobin reduces cell-cell adhesionA key early step in the metastatic process is the break-ing away and dissemination of cells from the primarytumor mass. To investigate the effect of plakoglobinexpression on cell-cell adhesion, we analyzed the abilityof control and knockdown cell lines to form three-dimensional spheroid structures in agar. Figure 3Eshows control MCF7 cells growing as spheroids on agar,demonstrating that these cells were able to form exten-sive bonds with surrounding cells. Control T47D, whichexpressed sixfold more plakoglobin than did controlMCF7 cells (see Figure 1A), grew as a much tighterspheroid. Reducing plakoglobin levels resulted in a com-plete loss of spheroid formation in MCF7 cells; both2A-1 and 3C-3 cells grew as monolayers across the sur-face of the agar, indicating that these cell lines no longerform strong intercellular bonds. Similarly, reducing pla-koglobin in T47D cells resulted in decreased cell-celladhesion, with 2A-4 cells growing in a less-compactspheroid formation than control cells and cells at theedge of the spheroid growing in a monolayer. Thereduced cell-cell adhesion after loss of plakoglobin wasconfirmed by measuring the ability of DiD-labeled con-trol and knockdown cells to adhere to a confluent cellmonolayer of the corresponding cell type. Measurementof the percentage of cells binding to a monolayer after 2hours (Figure 3F) showed that 19.23% \u00b1 2.6% of DiD-labeled MCF7 control cells bound to unlabeled controlcells, compared with 2.71% \u00b1 0.30% MCF7 2A-1 cellsbinding to unlabeled 2A-1 cells and 2.54% \u00b1 0.26% 3C-3cells binding to unlabeled cells. In addition, T47D con-trol cells were significantly more adhesive than T47D2A-4 cells; 19.01% \u00b1 2.79% of control cells adhered to amonolayer of the same cell type compared with 4.21% \u00b11.06% of 2A-4 cells (P < 0.005), demonstrating thatreduced expression of plakoglobin significantly reducescell-cell adhesion.Effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cell invasionand migrationAs invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding tissueand vasculature is an essential step for initiation ofmetastasis, we next investigated whether altering plako-globin levels affects invasion through a basement mem-brane. Reducing expression of plakoglobin significantlyincreased MCF7 and T47D tumor-cell invasion through8-\u00b5m pores in a Matrigel-coated membrane at 24 hours:89.8% of MCF7 2A-1 cells and 86.5% of MCF7 3C-3cells that migrated trough an uncoated membrane alsoinvaded through Matrigel compared with 36.6% ofMCF7 control cells (P < 0.001 for both knockdown celllines compared with control). Similar proinvasive effectswere also observed in plakoglobin-knockdown T47Dcells: 63.6% of T47D 2A-4 cells invaded throughMatrigel compared with just 1.3% of T47D control cells(P < 0.001; 2A-4 versus control) (Figure 4B). In theabsence of a basement membrane, plakoglobin-knock-down cells were significantly more migratory than werecontrol cells (250 \u00b1 50.4 MCF7 2A-1 cells and 248 \u00b154.2 MCF7 3C-3 cells migrated through 8-\u00b5m porescompared with 1.3 \u00b1 2.1 MCF7 control cells) over a 24-hour period. These data imply that reduced expressionof plakoglobin promotes cell migration toward a chemo-tactic agent.As knockdown cells had increased ability to invadethrough an artificial basement membrane compared withcontrol, we used a wound-healing assay to investigatewhether plakoglobin expression altered cell motility in theabsence of a chemotactic agent. No significant differencesin cell motility were observed between MCF7 control andplakoglobin-knockdown cells over a period of 72 hours(Figure 4D), with cell tracking showing individual cellsmoving at an average of (23 \u00b1 9 \u03bcm/h) for control; (27 \u00b1 8\u03bcm/h) for 2A-1 and (29 \u00b1 9 \u03bcm/h) for 3C-3. In contrast,significantly increased cellular movement was observed inT47D 2A-4 cells compared with control; after 24 hours,29.6% \u00b1 3.2% of the wound was closed in 2A-4 cells com-pared with 3.3% \u00b1 2.4% for control (P < 0.0001), increasingto 57.8% \u00b1 4.2% in 2A-4 and 16.7% \u00b1 3.5% in control cellsafter 48 hours (P < 0.0001; Figure 4E). Average cell move-ment measured by individual cell tracking was (11.5 \u00b1 4.8\u03bcm/h) for control and (18.6 \u00b1 8.4 \u03bcm/h) for 2A-4 cells,clearly demonstrating that loss of plakoglobin expressionis associated with a significant increase in cell motility,potentially leading to increased tumor cell spread.Effects of plakoglobin on expression of the tumor-suppressor molecule NM23-H1Reduced expression of NM23-H1 has been shown todisrupt cell-cell adhesion mediated by e-cadherin, result-ing in b-catenin nuclear translocation [25]. Furthermore,silencing of this gene promotes cellular scattering, moti-lity, and extracellular matrix invasion [26]. We thereforeinvestigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown onexpression of NM23-H1. As shown in Figure 4E redu-cing expression of plakoglobin by >80% resulted in a sig-nificant decrease of NM23-H1 in MCF7 2A-1 cells (P <0.005) and T47D 2A-4 (P < 0.005) cells. In contrast,expression of NM23-H1 was not significantly decreasedin MCF7 3C-3 cells (P = 0.08 compared with control),implying that prometastatic effects seen after plakoglo-bin knockdown may not be due to reduced expressionof MN23-H1.Effects of plakoglobin on tumor cell growth anddissemination in vivoAs the in vitro data showed that reduced plakoglobinexpression increased the prometastatic phenotype ofHolen et al.

At 32 days afterinoculation of tumor cells, MCF7 3C-3 tumors mea-sured 281.43 \u00b1 54.31 mm3, and control tumors mea-sured 184.21 \u00b1 34.93 mm3 (P < 0.001), with plakoglobinexpression accounting for 30.7% of the total variance.Furthermore, mammary fat pad inoculation of T47Dcells resulted in a 55-fold increase in growth of T47D2A-4 cells compared with control cells (Figure 5C).Real-time PCR analysis of tumors after extractionconfirmed that plakoglobin expression remained sup-pressed in knockdown cells in vivo (Figure 5B and 5C).MCF7 cells have previously been shown to home toand grow in mouse long bones when inoculated directlyinto the bloodstream [27]. We therefore analyzed thelong bones of tumor-bearing mice for evidence of meta-static tumor growth. Microcomputed tomography analy-sis of tibiae and femurs from mice bearing MCF7 cellsconfirmed that no evidence existed of osteolytic lesionsor tumor-induced bone loss in any mice bearing mam-mary fat pad tumors. In the absence of late-stage metas-tases (tumor in bone), we measured the effects ofaltered plakoglobin expression on an early metastaticevent by comparing the number of tumor cells in theFigure 5 Effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor growth in vivo. Ten Balb/c nude mice per group were inoculated with 1 \u00d7 105 MCF7control or MCF7 3C-3 cells (A) or 1 \u00d7 105 T47D control or T47D 2A-4 (B) into the fifth and tenth mammary fat pads.

Blood from tumor-free animals wasused as a negative control. Mice bearing 1 cc MCF7 3C-3 tumors had >2.5 times more tumor cells per millilitreof blood than did mice with 1-cc MCF7 control tumors,implying that reduced plakoglobin increases tumor cellshedding from the primary site into the circulation. Nocolonies formed by day 7 after plating of the 165EpCAM-positive cells isolated from MCF7 control sam-ples or tumor-free controls (Figure 6B). In contrast, 19colonies grew from a total of 522 cells isolated fromMCF7 3C-3 blood samples, showing that the EpCAM-positive population isolated from animals with plakoglo-bin knockdown tumors contains increased numbers ofviable tumor cells.DiscussionIn this study, we established that loss of plakoglobinleads to significant changes in breast cancer cell pheno-types, indicative of increased capacity for invasivegrowth. Accumulating evidence suggests that adhesiveinteractions are critical in the process of metastatictumor dissemination and that adhesion molecules canact as both positive and negative modulators of themetastatic process [reviewed in [28]]. The g-catenin-e-cadherin complex promotes homotypic tumor cell adhe-sion, maintaining intercellular contacts that confine cellsto the primary tumor site. Many studies have shown acorrelation between reduced e-cadherin expression andincreased metastasis both in laboratory models and inclinical samples; however, a direct functional role ofg-catenin in this process has not been shown [29-33].Evidence from clinical studies suggests that reducedexpression of plakoglobin in human breast cancers isassociated with increased tumor progression and adverseclinical outcome [34-36]. Additionally, translocation ofg-catenin from the membrane to the cytoplasm hasbeen shown in breast cancers with a more-aggressivephenotype [37]. Fitting with our hypothesis that reducedplakoglobin expression increases the metastatic pheno-type of cancer cells, we observed very low levels of pla-koglobin in the highly metastatic cancer cell lines:MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and HeLa, higher levelsof plakoglobin in weakly metastatic MCF7 cells, andvery high levels in nonmetastatic T47D cells. In accor-dance with previously published studies of human breastcancer biopsies, we found that cells with low levels ofplakoglobin expressed low levels of e-cadherin, and sig-nificantly more e-cadherin was detectable in nonmeta-static cell lines. Interestingly, levels of plakoglobin ande-cadherin not only correlated with each other, but alsoappeared to correlate with the metastatic potential ofthe cell lines tested, implying that loss of this catenin-cadherin complex is directly involved in the metastaticprocess.In the current study, we investigated the specificeffects of reduced plakoglobin expression on tumor cellmetastasis. Breast cancer metastasis is initiated by thetransition of epithelial cancer cells to a mesenchymalphenotype. We demonstrated that miRNA silencing ofFigure 6 Effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cellshedding into the bloodstream. (A) Numbers of circulating tumorcells per milliliter of blood isolated from five mice bearing controlMCF7 cells and five mice with MCF7 3C3 tumors.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86Page 11 of 14plakoglobin causes translocation of intercellular adhesionproteins e-cadherin and b-catenin from the cell mem-brane to the nucleus and the cytoplasm; these processesare strongly associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition [26,38,39]. These prometastatic changes havebeen linked with downregulation of the tumor suppres-sor NM23-H1 [25]. In the current study, NM23-H1expression was reduced in T47D 2A-3 and MCF7 2A-1cells; however, NM23-H1 was unaltered in MCF7 3C-3cells, which were significantly more migratory and inva-sive than MCF-7 2A-1 cells. Therefore, it appears thatalthough altering intercellular adhesion molecules candownregulate NM23-H1, other interacting factors maybe necessary for silencing of this gene. Key events ininitiation of metastasis include tumor cell proliferation,detachment of cells from the primary tumor, migrationtoward the vasculature, and invasion into the blood andlymphatic systems. Knocking down plakoglobin expres-sion substantially increased the prometastatic potentialof both cell lines, increasing proliferation, reducingintercellular adhesion, and increasing invasion. Tumorcell migration was also increased in T47D knockdowncells compared with control. Interestingly, alterations inmetastatic phenotype were more pronounced in T47Dthan in MCF7 cells. These observations may be due tothe differences in plakoglobin expression between thetwo cell lines: T47D miRNA knockdown cells expressbetween 19- and 21-fold lower plakoglobin levels com-pared with control, whereas plakoglobin expression inMCF7-knockdown cells is six- to eightfold lower com-pared with MCF7 control. MCF7 2A-1 cells that show asixfold reduction in plakoglobin compared with controlare less invasive and migratory than MCF7 3C-3 cells,whose plakoglobin expression is reduced eightfold com-pared with control. These data strongly indicate that thelevel of plakoglobin expression within a breast cancercell specifically correlates with its ability to undergoevents involved in escape of tumor cells from the pri-mary site.For a metastatic tumor to grow at a distal site, tumorcells must be able to invade the circulatory system, sur-vive in the bloodstream, and home to and colonize aspecific metastatic site [23,28,40]. In accordance withour in vitro findings, plakoglobin-knockdown cells grewsignificantly faster than control cells when inoculatedinto the mammary fat pads of balb/c nude mice. Inaddition, increased numbers of EpCAM-positive tumorcells were isolated from whole blood in mice withMCF7 3C-3 tumors compared with controls, and thecells were viable and able to form colonies when grownin culture. These data indicate a higher degree of tumorcell dissemination into the circulation from mammarytumors with low levels of plakoglobin than from tumorsexpressing high levels of this gene. Despite high levels ofcirculating EpCAM-positive cells in mice with MCF73C-3 tumors, metastatic tumor growth was not detectedin the bones of any animals. This finding may be due toMCF7 cells being unable to undergo the late stages ofmetastases (bone homing and colonization), althoughMCF7 cells have previously been used to induce breastcancer growth in bone after intracardiac inoculation[41]. The most likely explanation for this finding is thatmice used in the current study were 10 to 12 weeks oldwhen tumors were inoculated, and we and others haveshown tumors do not take if animals that are older than8 weeks. It is hypothesized that high bone turnover, asseen in young animals, is critical for human tumormetastasis to mouse bone [41,42]. We were unable totest this hypothesis in the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old animals, as the fat pads were too small to inoculate.It is also possible that any tumor metastases present inbone were undetectable because of the short period ofthese experiments (~5 weeks compared with 12 weeksrequired for metastatic lesions to develop in mousebones after intracardiac inoculation of MCF7 cells) [42].The effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cellhoming and colonization of distal organs clearly warrantfurther investigation and will form part of our futureresearch strategy.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study is the first to show thatreduced plakoglobin expression results in translocationof intercellular adhesion proteins e-cadherin and b-cate-nin from the cell membrane to the nucleus and cyto-plasm, as well as increasing cell-cell detachment,invasion, and intravascular dissemination of breast can-cer cells. Taken together, our results show that plakoglo-bin has a functional role in the metastatic process; itmay therefore be a suitable prognostic marker for breastcancer metastasis and be considered a potential thera-peutic target.AbbreviationsE. coli: Escherichia coli; FCS: fetal calf serum; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; miRNA:microribonucleic acid; \u03bcCT: microcomputed tomography; PE: phycoerythrin;RNAi: interfering ribonucleic acid; ssRNA: single-stranded ribonucleic acid.AcknowledgementsWork was funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research.Author details1Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, University of Sheffield, Medical School,Beech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX, UK. 2Centre for Stem Cell Research,University of Sheffield, Alfred Denny Building, Western Bank, Sheffield, S102TN, UK.Authors\u2019 contributionsIH was co-applicant on the grant providing the funds for this research,helped prepare the manuscript, and had significant academic input into thisproject.
