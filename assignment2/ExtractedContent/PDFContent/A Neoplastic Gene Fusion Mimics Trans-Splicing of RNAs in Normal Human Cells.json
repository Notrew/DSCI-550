"A Neoplastic Gene Fusion Mimics Trans-Splicing of RNAs in Normal Human Cells1.36 ng mm\u20132 and a kd of 0.081 s\u22121 (Fig. 4B).When the two proteins were mixed, a Geq of5.95 ng mm\u20132 was reached. An apparent kd >0.0008 s\u22121 was determined by fitting a mono-exponential function to the dissociation phase,which is 3 and 2 orders of magnitude lower ascompared with the single proteins (fig. S7). BothSOPC and DOPS:SOPC bilayers showed no in-teraction with the control protein MBP (Fig. 4,A and B). Dissociation of bound CHMP2ADC andCHMP3DC in Hepes buffered saline (HBS) con-taining 1 M NaCl revealed a kd \u2265 1 s\u22121, which wasmuch faster than dissociation in HBS alone. Incontrast, the CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC polymer didnot dissociate with a higher rate (kd \u2264 0.00046 s\u22121)in the presence of 1 M NaCl (fig. S7), indi-cating resistance to change in ionic strength.Once assembled on membranes, CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC did not exchange with soluble ormembrane-bound CHMP3DC (fig. S8). Thus,CHMP2A-3 complexes assembled on membranesin vitro in the absence of CHMP4-6 subcomplexes,even though yeast Snf7-Vps20 (CHMP4-6) com-plexes may recruit Vps2-Vps24 (CHMP2A-3)complexes to membranes in vivo (7).To assess the influence of CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC tubes on membrane shapes, weused large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) com-posed of DOPS:SOPC. LUV incubation witheither CHMP2ADC or CHMP3DC had no ef-fect on their floatation in sucrose gradients (fig.S9, A and B), whereas preformed CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC tubes restricted LUV floatation tothe middle of the gradient (fig. S9, C and D).Negative staining EM confirmed CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC tube membrane interaction via theirouter surfaces (Fig. 4, C and D). However, nosystematic remodeling of the LUV membraneswas observed. Potential membrane remodelingby the CHMP copolymer or vice versa was fur-ther explored by assembling the polymer inthe presence of LUVs. Although CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC assembly in the presence of SOPCLUVs had no effect on tube morphology (Fig. 4E),the presence of DOPS:SOPC LUVs producedshorter tubes (Fig. 4F), displaying loose helicalcoils (Fig. 4G) and cone-shaped tubes that ap-peared closed at the narrower end (Fig. 4H). Thus,this suggests a mechanism where lipid interac-tion affects CHMP polymerization.Because modified VPS4 and CHMP3 exertdominant negative effects on HIV-1 budding(8, 9, 17, 25) and cytokinesis (6, 18), CHMP2A-CHMP3-VPS4 complexes may catalyze a commonstep such as membrane fission. The CHMP2A-CHMP3 polymer presents a membrane bindingtopology that is inverse to that of dynamin mem-brane complexes (26), which catalyze endocytot-ic vesicle abscission (27). ESCRT-III coupled toVPS4 may exert a similar role in budding pro-cesses directed away from the cytosol. Thus, wepropose that a helical CHMP2A-CHMP3 poly-mer assembles on the inside of a membrane bud,which may induce membrane deformation, lead-ing to constriction and eventually abscission whencoupled to VPS4 activity, the only energy-providingcandidate in the pathway (2, 15) (fig. S10).References and Notes1. R. L. Williams, S. Urbe, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 8, 355(2007).2. S. Saksena, J. Sun, T. Chu, S. D. Emr, Trends Biochem.Sci. 32, 561 (2007).3. J. H. Hurley, Curr. Opin.

We showthat normal endometrial stromal cells contain a specific chimeric RNA joining 5\u2032 exons of theJAZF1 gene on chromosome 7p15 to 3\u2032 exons of the Polycomb group gene JJAZ1/SUZ12 onchromosome 17q11 and that this RNA is translated into JAZF1-JJAZ1, a protein with anti-apoptoticactivity. The JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA appears to arise from physiologically regulated trans-splicingbetween precursor messenger RNAs for JAZF1 and JJAZ1. The chimeric RNA and protein areidentical to those produced from a gene fusion found in human endometrial stromal tumors.These observations suggest that certain gene fusions may be pro-neoplastic owing to constitutiveexpression of chimeric gene products normally generated by trans-splicing of RNAs indeveloping tissues.Recurrent, specific gene fusions arisingfrom chromosomal rearrangements arecharacteristic features of many neoplasms,especially those having hematopoietic and mes-enchymal origins (1\u20136). In most fusions, recom-bination occurs within introns that interrupt thecoding sequences, giving rise to the expression ofchimeric proteins (2). The prevailing view is thatthe chimeric proteins resulting from chromosom-al rearrangements are entirely abnormal and haveneoplastic effects leading to the growth and/orsurvival advantage of cells containing them.An observation that seems at odds with thisview is that chimeric mRNAs identical to thosederived from fusion genes can often be detectedin low abundance by reverse transcription\u20131Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine,New Haven, CT 06520, USA. 2Department of Obstetrics andGynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, NewHaven, CT06520, USA.*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The explanation generallyoffered for this finding is that specific chromosom-al rearrangements occur within small numbers ofcells in healthy tissues but that the chimeric pro-teins generated by them are alone insufficient todrive substantial clonal expansion.We have previously described a gene fusiondue to a (7;17)(p15;q21) chromosomal trans-location found in about 50% of human endome-trial stromal sarcomas (ESSs) (8, 9). The fusionjoins the first three exons (from a total of five) inthe gene JAZF1 to the last 15 (from 16) in thePolycomb group gene JJAZ1/SUZ12. Expressionof the chimeric JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein in culturedhuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells con-fers resistance to apoptosis and, when accom-panied by suppression of the unrearranged JJAZ1allele, increased rates of proliferation (9).We examined normal human endometrialtissues for possible chimeric JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA, beginning with endometrial stromal celllines. RNA extracted from the immortalized,normal human endometrial stromal cell line(HESC) (10) was analyzed for the presence ofJAZF1-JJAZ1 chimeric RNA by RT-PCR withprimers containing sense and antisense sequenceflanking the site of joining between JAZF1 andJJAZ1 (11). A single amplification productgenerated by this reaction was identical in size tothat amplified from human ESSs carrying aJAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion due to the presenceof a t(7;17)(p15;q21) (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR forthe JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in two additional, non-immortalized primary cell lines derived fromthe normal endometrial stroma of two other pa-tients amplified similarly sized products. Nucleo-tide sequence analysis of the RT-PCR productsfrom each cell line yielded the same sequence ofnucleotides at the JAZF1-JJAZ1 junction as wasfound in RNA of tumors with the gene fusion.RT-PCR for JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA failed to am-plify products from the RNA extracted from avariety of other epithelial and mesenchymal celllines, all of which contained JAZF1 and JJAZ1RNA (fig. S1).To investigate the specificity of the junctionbetween JAZF1 and JJAZ1 RNA sequences inthe HESC cell line, we carried out detailed RT-PCR studies on RNA from the HESC cell lineusing antisense primers for JJAZ1 exon 3 se-quence paired with six different sense primers forfive exons of JAZF1. With primers for the firstthree exons of JAZF1, single products were ob-tained matching the sizes predicted for the join-ing of JAZF1 exon 3 to JJAZ1 exon 2 (Fig. 1B).Similar results were achieved when the senseprimer for JAZF1 exon 3 was paired with sixdifferent antisense primers distributed among the16 exons of JJAZ1. These results are consistentwith the JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA joined at exon 3 andexon 2 of the respective genes being the onlyabundant JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in HESC cells.To determine whether the JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA is translated into protein, we performedWestern blot analysis with JJAZ1-specific anti-body on protein extracts prepared from HESCcells. This analysis detected a protein identical insize to JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein detected in ESSs(Fig. 1C and supporting online text).The detection of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in en-dometrial stromal cell lines was duplicated byRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from normalhuman uteri. JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA was detectedprimarily in endometrium from late secretory andearly proliferative phases of the menstrual cycle(Fig. 2A). No JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA sequences wereamplified from normal myometrium at any phaseof the cycle (fig. S2).Because of the general association of theJAZF1-JJAZ1 RNAwith endometrium from par-ticular phases of the menstrual cycle, we inves-tigated the effects of steroid hormones on theproduction of the chimeric transcript in HESCcells. Low concentrations of progesterone seemedto slightly increase amounts of the JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA seen in the absence of added hormone,whereas both estrogen and, at higher concen-trations, progesterone suppressed detection of thechimeric RNA (Fig. 2B). These findings areconsistent with the results of analyses on endo-metrial tissue, showing that JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNAis present predominantly at the beginning andend of the menstrual cycle, when hormone con-centrations are low.Because normal endometrium is subjected tohypoxia and undergoes apoptosis during the latesecretory phase of the menstrual cycle, we in-vestigated whether hypoxia can induce produc-tion of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in HESC cells bytreatment with desferroximine (DFO), whichsimulates hypoxic conditions. HESC cells treatedwith 250 mMDFO for 8 hours showed increasedamounts of JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA(Fig. 2C).Another,ESS-RTdH2OMarkersHESCAJAZF1-JJAZ1JAZF1-JJAZ1BC300 bp  JAZF1-JJAZ1JAZF1-JJAZ1JJAZ1JJAZ1ESSESSTumorTumor HESCHESC 29329381 kD107 kD1   2   3   42 kb1.6 kb1 kb0.5 kb0.3 kbJAZF1JJAZ185   6   7 9  10 11 121 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 12110.2 kb0.1 kb3 kbFig. 1.

Analysis of theRNA in DFO-treated HESC cells by a nucleaseprotection assay (fig. S3) indicated that some-what less chimeric RNA was produced in thesecells than in tumor cells containing the JAZF1-JJAZ1 fusion, consistent with relative amounts of10 to 35% detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Thenuclease protection assay also confirmed thatdetection of chimeric RNA was not a methodo-logic artifact associated with RT-PCR. Quantita-tive RT-PCR revealed that treatment of HESCcells with DFO did not appreciably change theamount of either JAZF1 or JJAZ1 RNA (fig. S4),suggesting that DFO raises the levels of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA by a mechanism independent ofincreased transcription of the two genes.To investigate whether JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA isproduced from a t(7;17)(p15;q21) in HESC cells,we first showed that this cell line, which had notintentionally been cloned, had in fact originatedfrom a single cell immortalized in culture (fig.S5). We then performed Southern blot analysesof HESC DNA by using probes that had pre-viously detected t(7;17)(p15;q21) rearrangementsin ESSs. No rearranged bands were detected. Cy-togenetic analysis of numerous metaphase spreadsfrom HESC cells revealed no abnormalities inchromosomes 7, 17, or any other chromosome(Fig. 3A). Similarly, analysis by fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) with pairs of bacterialartificial chromosome (BAC) probes for DNAflanking on either side the chromosome 7p15breakpoint and separately the 17q21 breakpointdetected no breakage in these regions of thegenome (fig. S5). Additionally, a probe consist-ing of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) thatcontains DNA spanning the 7p15 breakpointshowed no splitting of the fluorescent signal (Fig.3B). Finally, no superimposition of signals wasobserved when probes for chromosomes 7p15and 17q21 were used together in FISH studies.To investigate the possibility that (7; 17)(p15;q21)translocations or their equivalents arose in cells inculture at some point after immortalization, wesubcloned HESC cells by limiting dilution.Thirty-seven subclones derived on average fromhalf a cell per culture were tested for the pro-duction of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA. RT-PCR of RNAfrom these subclones detected JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA in all clones examined, and for most sub-clones, the amount of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in-creased when DFO was added to the culture (Fig.3C). Furthermore, analyses of all clones ex-amined were negative for rearrangements at thechromosome 7p15 site by FISH with flankingprobes (Fig. 3D). Ten of these subclones werealso tested for rearrangements at the 17q12 site byFISH, and none of these showed abnormalities.Given the evidence against DNA recombina-tion in HESC cells and the precise joining ofsequences at exon boundaries in JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA, we reasoned that the mechanism mostlikely responsible for production of this RNA istrans-splicing of pre-mRNAs for the JAZF1 andJJAZ1 genes. To test this hypothesis, we preparedin vitro splicing extracts from the nuclei of HESCcells. Samples of this extract were mixed withsamples of a nuclear extract from a primaryrhesus fibroblast cell line RF (12). RT-PCR ofJJAZ1 intron 1 RNA sequence revealed that un-spliced pre-mRNAwas present in the HESC andRF nuclear extracts (fig. S7). Nucleotide se-quence analysis of exon 3 in the JAZF1 gene ofRF cells showed two single base-pair sequencedifferences from the human JAZF1 gene thatpermitted both selective RT-PCR of any RNAcontaining either rhesus or human exon 3 and theability to distinguish between the products am-plified from these RNAs. With selective primersand conditions, amplification of RNA after incu-bation of mixed extracts yielded products inwhich RF JAZF1 exon 3 was joined to exon 2 ofJJAZ1 (Fig. 4B). Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products confirmed that the amplifiedJAZF1-JJAZ1 sequences contained exon 3 ofRF JAZF1 (Fig. 4C). The amount of productgenerally increased when the HESC extract wasprepared from cells cultured with DFO, althoughthe extent of increase varied considerably amongexperiments. No product was obtained from ex-tracts of HESC cells or RF cells alone, or whenadenosine 5\u00b4-triphosphate (ATP), an obligatecofactor for splicing, was omitted from the splic-ing reaction. Similar results were obtained withextracts from the nonimmortalized endometrialstromal cell line, HESC-597 (Fig. 4D).To study the mechanism further and to ruleout the possibility of polymerase switching dur-ing transcription, we carried out the in vitro trans-splicing assay with HESC nuclear extract mixedwith purified RF RNA.

Trans-splicing of noncoding, leader exonsto separately transcribed pre-mRNAs is commonin certain lower eukaryotes, such as protozoa andnematodes (13\u201316). However, in vertebrates, onlya few examples of trans-splicing have been de-scribed (17\u201325), and most of these involve splic-ing between pre-mRNAs of the same gene togenerate mRNAs with duplicated exons (17\u201320).For these reasons, trans-splicing in vertebrateshas sometimes been regarded as a nonfunctionalby-product of a somewhat sloppy splicing sys-tem (26). This conclusion seems inapplicable toJAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA because the JAZF1-JJAZ1fusion gene is a recurrent finding in a high frac-tion of endometrial stromal tissues, and fusiongenes associated with chromosomal transloca-tions in cancer have repeatedly been shown tocontribute to the neoplastic phenotype of thetumors containing them (27, 28). Additionally,the expression of the JAZF1-JJAZ1 coding se-quences in cultured cells has demonstrated ef-fects on cell survival and proliferation (9).Whether JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein in tissues pro-vides protection from hypoxia, to which endo-metrium is subjected during the late secretoryphase and possibly the early proliferative phaseof the menstrual cycle, remains to be determined.The mechanisms involved in the trans-splicing of RNAs and the regulation of this pro-cess are unclear. Juxtaposition of the loci encodingthe RNAs that participate in trans-splicing wouldnot seem essential because in vitro splicing innuclear extracts of RNAs at physiological con-centrations was found to be efficient. These re-sults also indicate that cotranscriptional splicingis not an absolute requirement for trans-splicing.Whether in vivo trans-splicing of RNA tran-scribed from loci that participate in chromosomalrearrangements predisposes DNA at those sites torecombination with or without prior intranuclearcolocalization of the loci will require furtherinvestigation.In view of the regulated trans-splicing be-tween JAZF1 and JJAZ1 pre-mRNAs in normalendometrium, the t(7;17)(p15;q21) found inESSs might be considered a mutation that leadsto constitutive production of the JAZF1-JJAZ1mRNA and its protein product. This relation issimilar to that seen in other oncogenic mutationsassociated with tumor development, namely, thatmutations lead to overproduction or irreversibleactivation of gene products rather than to creationof \u201cnew\u201d genes, as the fusion genes resulting frommany chromosomal translocations and other DNArearrangements have generally been thought to be.If RNA products of fusion genes other thanJAZF1-JJAZ1 also mimic normal products re-sulting from trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs, itwould explain the ability to frequently amplifyfrom healthy tissues chimeric RNAs associatedwith chromosomal rearrangements in tumors.Considering the large number of recurrent genefusions found in tumors, it would further sug-gest that trans-spliced RNAs may be relativelycommon in normal cells and tissues (support-ing online text). At a minimum, the finding of thetrans-spliced JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in normal cellsimplies a risk to inferring the presence of chro-mosomal rearrangements in tissue specimens forthe diagnosis and detection of cancer, especiallyin the context of minimal disease. Additionally, itis possible that drugs designed to target chimericproteins produced by neoplastic gene fusionsmay have toxicities due to inhibited function ofsimilar proteins in normal cells.References and Notes1.

Pennison,2Maureen Sadim,2 Boris Pasche,2* Stephan M. Tanner,1* Albert de la Chapelle1*Much of the genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans is unexplained.Studying a Caucasian-dominated population in the United States, we showed that germlineallele-specific expression (ASE) of the gene encoding transforming growth factor\u2013b (TGF-b)type I receptor, TGFBR1, is a quantitative trait that occurs in 10 to 20% of CRC patients and1 to 3% of controls. ASE results in reduced expression of the gene, is dominantly inherited,segregates in families, and occurs in sporadic CRC cases. Although subtle, the reduction inconstitutive TGFBR1 expression alters SMAD-mediated TGF-b signaling. Two major TGFBR1haplotypes are predominant among ASE cases, which suggests ancestral mutations, but causativegermline changes have not been identified. Conservative estimates suggest that ASE confers asubstantially increased risk of CRC (odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 29.1), butthese estimates require confirmation and will probably show ethnic differences.The annual worldwide incidence of colo-rectal cancer (CRC) exceeds 1 million,being the second to fourth most commoncancer in industrialized countries (1). Althoughdiet and lifestyle are thought to have a strongimpact on CRC risk, genes have a key role in thepredisposition to this cancer. A positive familyhistory of CRC occurs in 20 to 30% of all pro-bands. Highly penetrant autosomal dominantand recessive hereditary forms of CRC accountfor at most 5% of all CRC cases (2). Althoughadditional high- and low-penetrance alleles havebeen proposed, much of the remaining predis-position to CRC remains unexplained (3).www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 321 5 SEPTEMBER 2008 1361REPORTSCorrected 18 September 2015; see full text.Downloaded from https://www.science.org at University of Southern California on March 26, 2022Use of this article is subject to the Terms of serviceScience (ISSN 1095-9203) is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 1200 New York Avenue NW,Washington, DC 20005.
