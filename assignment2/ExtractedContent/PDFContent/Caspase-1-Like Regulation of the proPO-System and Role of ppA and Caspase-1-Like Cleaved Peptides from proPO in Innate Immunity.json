One of the important innateimmune responses in arthropods is the activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) by a proteolytic cascade finalized by theproPO-activating enzyme (ppA), which leads to melanization and the elimination of pathogens. Proteolytic cascades play acrucial role in innate immune reactions because they can be triggered more quickly than immune responses that requirealtered gene expression. Caspases are intracellular proteases involved in tightly regulated limited proteolysis of downstreamprocesses and are also involved in inflammatory responses to infections for example by activation of interleukin 1\u00df. Here weshow for the first time a link between caspase cleavage of proPO and release of this protein and the biological function ofthese fragments in response to bacterial infection in crayfish. Different fragments from the cleavage of proPO were studiedto determine their roles in bacterial clearance and antimicrobial activity. These fragments include proPO-ppA, the N-terminal part of proPO cleaved by ppA, and proPO-casp1 and proPO-casp2, the fragments from the N-terminus aftercleavage by caspase-1. The recombinant proteins corresponding to all three of these peptide fragments exhibited bacterialclearance activity in vivo, and proPO-ppA had antimicrobial activity, as evidenced by a drastic decrease in the number ofEscherichia coli in vitro. The bacteria incubated with the proPO-ppA fragment were agglutinated and their cell morphologywas altered. Our findings show an evolutionary conserved role for caspase cleavage in inflammation, and for the first timeshow a link between caspase induced inflammation and melanization. Further we give a more detailed understanding ofhow the proPO system is regulated in time and place and a role for the peptide generated by activation of proPO as well asfor the peptides resulting from Caspase 1 proteolysis.Citation: Jearaphunt M, Noonin C, Jiravanichpaisal P, Nakamura S, Tassanakajon A, et al.

Intruding microorganisms are frequently melanized ininvertebrates, and during this process, low-molecular-weightphenolic substances are converted into polymeric melanin in amulti-step chain of reactions. The initiation steps of this reactionare catalyzed by the prophenoloxidase activating system (proPOsystem), and other steps occur spontaneously. The proPO system isa proteolytic enzyme cascade and its primary function is torecognize minuscule amounts (picograms per liter) of cell wallproducts from microorganisms (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pepti-doglycan (PGN) and glucans) and respond to the microorganismby activation of the system and the subsequent generation ofimmune factors. This cascade requires careful regulation toachieve spatial and temporal control to avoid dangerous sideeffects [1]. A number of regulatory factors are involved incontrolling the activation of the proPO system, includingproteinase inhibitors [2] and the melanization-inhibiting protein(in insects, crayfish and shrimp) [3], [4], [5].The importance of melanization (proPO system) in controlling anumber of specific host\u2013pathogen encounters has been demon-strated over the past few years. One example of this is thebracovirus protein Egf1.0, which inhibits the prophenoloxidasePLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004059&domain=pdf(proPO)-activating proteinase in the insect Manduca sexta [6]. Twoother recent examples are found in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilinaboulardi, which targets the Drosophila phenoloxidase cascade byproducing a specific serpin inhibitor [7], and in the bacteriumPhotorhabdus luminescens, which secretes a small organic moleculethat acts as a negative regulator of PO activity [8]. In addition, apathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila strain becomes highly virulent tocrayfish when the PO transcript levels are experimentally reduced[9]. The proPO activation system, or melanization cascade, bearsfunctional resemblance to the complement system, although thefinal reaction, melanization, is different. Intriguingly, recently wesucceeded in showing that all of the steps in the proPO-cascade inTenebrio molitor are shared with the proteinase cascade that leads tothe activation of the Toll pathway for the production ofantimicrobial peptides [10]. This shared cascade has beenconfirmed in several other insects [11], [12]. In the present study,we found that caspases are very important for the rapiddegradation of proPO, which prevents oxidation in places whereit is not appropriate.Caspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases, are a family of thecysteine proteases that are known for their function in apoptosis[13]. Some caspases are involved in the inflammatory system via theregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and these caspases arenecessary regulators of the unconventional secretion of leaderlessproteins [14], [15]. In humans, caspase-1 is not only required for theactivation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1b and pro-IL-18, but alsofunctions as an activator of nuclear factor of the kappa-enhancerin B-cells (NF-kB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) [16]. Interleukin-1b is produced as a cytosolic precursorand is dependent on caspase-1 cleavage for its activation andsecretion [15], [17]. The proPO is also produced as a leaderlessprotein, most likely in the cytosol, and is secreted by an unknownmechanism. We, therefore, searched the sequence for caspase-1cleavage sites and found two in the middle of the Cu-binding region.Therefore, we asked whether caspase-1-like cleavage of proPO isinvolved in the regulation of PO activity. We also asked whether thecaspase-cleaved fragments have biological functions and whetherthese fragments are involved in immune functions even in theabsence of PO activity. We also studied whether the peptidefragments generated by the cleavage of proPO into active PO by theprophenoloxidase activating enzyme (ppA), which gives a peptide ofapproximately 20 kD, might have some immune function during orimmediately prior to melanization.Our studies provide new information about the function ofcaspase-1-like activity in freshwater crayfish, in which it acts as anegative regulator of the proPO system. For the first time, weprovide results showing that the fragments resulting from caspaseor ppA cleavage have important biological functions.ResultsLocalization of proPO and detection of caspase-1-likeprotein in crayfishProPO, the inactive form of PO, is present in crayfishhemocytes, especially in the granular cells (GC). GCs are denselyfilled with granules, as indicated by their name. Upon activationby different environmental challenges such as microbes, exocytosisis induced, which causes the release of several proteins from thegranules of the GCs and the release of proPO into the externalmilieu [18]. Immunostaining of proPO in GCs revealed thatproPO is present in the cytoplasm but not in the granules, and notall GC cells express proPO (Figures 1A\u2013C). ProPO is cleavedextracellularly to produce active PO upon activation by ppA.However, the mechanism by which proPO is released is stillunknown. In beet armyworm and Drosophila, prostaglandins andJNK can stimulate cell lysis and subsequent proPO release [19],[20]. In mammal, there are many reports showing that inflamma-somes and caspase-1 activation are involved in the secretion ofproteins without signal peptides [21], [22]. Thus, we askedwhether caspase-1 plays a role in proPO release and/orregulation. To answer this question, the presence of caspase-1 inthe crayfish was examined. The transcriptome analysis of thefreshwater crayfish P. leniusculus (unpublished data) revealed thepresence of a translated amino acid sequence that has 36%identity to Drosophila caspase interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme(GenBank: NP524551). Additionally, by using an antibody againsthuman caspase-1, two bands with sizes about 40 and 50 kDa weredetected from crayfish hemocyte lysate (Figure 1D). These bandsare probably two isoforms of the crayfish procaspase-1 likeproteins. In comparison, in human six different isoforms ofcaspase-1 have been found. The 50 kDa procaspase-1 like proteinwas also detected in crayfish plasma and the level of this protein inplasma was decreased 1 h after an injection of E. coli or A.hydrophila compared to the control (0.15 M NaCl) (Figure 1E).Notably, when the 50 kDa band decreased, a 20 kDa bandappeared in the plasma (Figure 1E). The 20 kDa band is similar insize to the p20 subunit of mammalian caspase-1, which is theactive subunit of this protein. The active caspase-1 could only bedetected in the supernatant and not in human keratinocyte lysates[15]. This is probably because it is rapidly degraded or released tothe outside of cells and is therefore not present in cell lysates.Another explanation may be that active caspase-1 has a very shorthalf-life, and therefore, its concentration under physiologicalconditions is very low [22], [23]. Caspase-1 activity was alsofound to be slightly increased in plasma at 1 h after injection withE.coli but no statistically significant difference could be observed(Figure 1F) and this activity could be decreased by incubation ofthe caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK.Caspase-1 cleavage site of crayfish proPOOur results suggest that caspase-1-like activity is present incrayfish and that this activity can be activated during infection. Asmentioned above, the activation of caspase-1 in vertebrates isinvolved in the secretion of several proteins, such as IL-1 b, but todate, no such mechanism has been identified in invertebrates,although the secretion of leaderless proteins such as proPO [18]and Pl-b-thymosins [24] has been observed. Therefore, the aminoAuthor SummaryMelanization is an important reaction in most multicellularorganisms, both animals and plants. The initiation steps ofthis reaction in invertebrates are catalyzed by theprophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system a proteolyticenzyme cascade, which primary function is to recognizecell wall products from microorganisms and respond byactivation of the system and generation of immuneeffector molecules. This cascade requires careful regulationto achieve spatial and temporal control to avoid danger-ous side effects. We here show that a Caspase1-likeenzyme can inactivate proPO when ppA is not activatingthe proPO to avoid deleterious effects and further weshow for the first time that the N-terminal peptide fromppA cleavage of proPO (activation of proPO) has animportant biological function as also the Caspase1 cleavedfragments. Our results also show that Caspase 1-inducedinflammatory response is evolutionarily conserved and islinked to melanization.Caspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-SystemPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059acid sequence of proPO was analyzed to determine whether thereis a potential caspase-1 cleavage site in the proPO sequence. Twocaspase-1 cleavage sites were found, after amino acids 363 and389, which would give rise to two N-terminal proPO fragmentswith predicted sizes of approximately 42 kDa (proPO-casp1) and45 kDa (proPO-casp2), respectively (Figure 2A). These twocleavage sites are located downstream of the cleavage site forppA and would give rise to a small N-terminal fragment (20 kDaof proPO-ppA) and a C-terminal active PO [25]. Therefore,cleavage as the result of caspase-1-like activity has the potential toreduce the PO activity and act as a negative regulator of theproPO system.The presence of proPO-caspase fragments in the plasmaand plasma PO activity after bacterial infection in vivoTo investigate whether any proPO-caspase fragment (proPO-casp) is released from hemocytes, plasma proteins from bacteria-infected crayfish were subjected to western blotting. The results inFigure 2B show that two caspase-cleaved proPO fragments werepresent in the plasma after bacterial infection and that the levels ofFigure 1.

Western blot showing the presence of procaspase-1-like proteins (40 and 50 kDa) in the hemocytes of untreated crayfish (D). The 50 kDa bandwas detected in crayfish plasma and the level of this band was decreased in bacteria injected crayfish (E). In addition, the active subunit of caspase,p20, was detected in plasma (E). Plasma caspase-1 activity was determined, and the activity was reduced by the addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK (F). The values shown are mean of five samples and the bars indicate SEM. The statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004059.g001Caspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-SystemPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059both proPO-casps increased with time, whereas the plasma proPOlevel decreased. Moreover, the level of proPO-casp1 was higherthan that of proPO-casp2 at all time points. This result suggeststhat proPO-casp2 may be degraded faster than proPO-casp1 invivo. When non-virulent E. coli was injected, the released proPOwas rapidly cleaved by a caspase, and high levels of the fragmentswere detected at 1 and 3 hours post injection. In contrast, theinjection of a virulent A. hydrophila strain resulted in slower caspasecleavage, and a high level was reached after 3 hours (Figure 2B).Interestingly, when the levels of the C-terminal fragments ofproPO in the samples were analyzed, neither active PO, norproPO-casps could be detected, and only inactive proPO wasfound in the plasma. This result suggests that the C-terminalfragments of proPO produced by caspase-1-like cleavage, as wellas ppA cleavage, are degraded rapidly.Because cleavage by caspase-1 may reduce PO activity, theenzyme activity in the plasma was measured after bacterialinfection (Figure 2C). The PO activity decreased after E. coliinfection, but there was no significant difference, and interestingly,the plasma PO activity was significantly higher at 1 h after A.hydrophila infection, at time at which the plasma proPO-casp levelswere low, and the enzyme activity markedly decreased by 3 h,when the levels of these fragments were higher. Notably, allanimals died 4\u20136 hours after A. hydrophila infection.Ca2+-dependence of proPO-casps release in vitroCa2+has been reported to induce exocytosis in crayfishhemocytes [18] and regulates inflammasome activation and thuscaspase-1 activation [17], [26]. Therefore, we investigated theeffect of Ca2+on proPO-casp release in in vitro experiments withisolated GCs. As shown in Figure 3A, the release of proPO andboth proPO-casp fragments was Ca2+and time dependent. Whenthe antibody against the C-terminus of proPO was used, proPObut not active PO or proPO-casps could be detected. Again, thisresult suggests that the C-terminal fragments of proPO are rapidlydegraded.To confirm that the proPO-casp fragments are the result of acaspase-1-like cleavage, the effect of the caspase-1 inhibitors Z-YVAD-FMK or Ac-WEHD-FMK on the release of proPO-caspfragments was examined. The results presented in Figure 3Bclearly show that the production of proPO-casps was markedlydecreased in the presence of Z-YVAD (Figure 3B) or Z-WEHD-FMK (Figure S1). The amount of released proPO into themedium was also decreased in the presence of Z-YVAD-FMK,and a higher level of proPO in granular cell lysate was observedwhen the cells were incubated with caspase-1 inhibitors (FigureS1).Furthermore, dsRNA caspase-1 treatment of granular hemo-cytes caused a complete reduction of the caspase-1 like transcript(Figure 3C), but no obvious reduction in protein level could beobserved (data not shown). However, when the cells were treatedwith Ca2+for 3 h to induce release of caspase-1 at 65 h of dsRNAtreatment, the caspase-1 knockdown cells fail to produce newprocaspase-1 like protein after another 24 h culture in L-15(Figure 3D). The lower level of caspase-1 like protein resulted in areduction of the levels of proPO-casp fragments both in cell lysateand medium. No change in total proPO protein could be observedafter the RNAi treatment of granular cells (Figure 3D).Recombinant protein expression and purificationBecause putative caspase-1 cleavage products were clearlydetected outside GCs in vitro and in vivo, we decided to determine ifthese fragments possess biological functions. The N-terminal partsof proPO produced by cleavage at the putative caspase-1 cleavagesite between Asp363 and Ala364 (proPO-casp1), and the fragmentproduced by cleavage between Asp389 and Asn390 (proPO-casp2)were produced as recombinant proteins with estimated sizes of 43and 47 kDa, respectively. In addition, the N-terminal peptidefragment of proPO generated by cleavage by ppA between Arg176and Thr177 [25] was produced (proPO-ppA).To determine whether any of the proPO fragments are involvedin the immune system, the bacterial clearance activities of theseproteins were assessed. The fragments were mixed with bacteriaand then injected into crayfish. Bacterial number in hemolymphwas examined at 40 min and 3 h post injection. After 40 min, theE. coli titer was already significantly decreased in the proPO-ppA,proPO-casp1, and GFP treatment groups, whereas the injection ofFigure 2. Cleavage site of caspase-1-like protein and thepresence of proPO-casp fragments in plasma and the plasmaPO activity after bacterial injection. Schematic figure of the proPOprotein indicating the cleavage site for ppA and the putative cleavagesites for a caspase-1-like enzyme (A). Recombinant proPO-casp1 andproPO-casp2 fragments were expressed with a hexahistidine-tag at theN-terminus, and proPO-ppA was expressed with a thioredoxin tag atthe N-terminus. Crayfish (N = 5) were injected with E. coli or A.hydrophila B1. Hemolymph was collected at 0, 1, and 3 h after injection.The proPO level in the plasma decreased over time, whereas the levelsof proPO-casps increased (A). There was no significant difference in POactivity in the plasma from E. coli-infected crayfish. In contrast, the POactivity significantly increased at 1 h and markedly decreased at 3 hafter A. hydrophila B1 infection, in correlation with the appearance ofproPO-casp fragments (B). The statistical analysis was performed usingone-way ANOVA. * P,0.05, significant difference compared with the0 h time point,##P,0.01, significant difference compared with the 3 htime point.

Because GFP also caused reduction of bacterial numberat this time point, this might be a general protein effect. However, at3 h post injection, the numbers of E. coli in the proPO-ppA, proPO-casp1, and proPO-casp2 injection groups were significantly lowerthan that in the non-protein injection groups and the GFP group(Figure 4B).The antimicrobial activities of all three fragments werethen tested in vitro to determine if the bacterial clearance was causedby the proteins themselves or if other components were involved inthe clearance process. The titer of E. coli decreased significantly afterproPO-ppA treatment compared with the non-protein treatment,whereas the other fragments had no significant effect and did notexhibit any antibacterial activity (Figure 5A). When the treatedbacteria were observed under the microscope, very strongagglutination was detected after treatment with the proPO-ppApeptide, whereas no signs of agglutination occurred with the proPO-casp fragments or GFP (Figure 5B). The minimal agglutinatingconcentration for proPO-ppA was the lowest for E. coli andStaphylococcus aureus, and the proPO-ppA fragment appeared to havethe ability to agglutinate all of the tested bacterial species (Table 1).When the bacteria were observed by SEM after 15 and 40 min ofincubation, we could see that proPO-ppA disrupted the E. coli cellmorphology, causing the cell walls to shrink. After 15 min ofincubation, the E. coli treated with proPO-ppA started to show signsof cell wall disruption, and a longitudinal line was observed(Figure 5C), in contrast to the GFP-treated bacteria (Figure 5D).After 40 min of incubation, the E. coli treated with proPO-ppAclearly formed clumps (Figure 5F), and the cells were flat (Figures 5Hand 5I).Then, a bacteria viability assay was performed to determine ifthe strong agglutination killed the bacteria. Fluorescence micros-copy clearly revealed that the proPO-ppA fragment greatlydecreased the cell viability compared with the control treatmentsas measured by the red staining of dead bacteria (Figure 6). A fewagglutinated bacteria were stained with only SYTO9 andappeared green in the merged picture (live cells).DiscussionThe proPO system is an important innate immune response andis composed of a cascade of proteinases that terminates with theactivation of the proenzyme proPO. After proteolytic cleavage,proPO becomes an active redox enzyme, PO, which formsmelanin and other antimicrobial products in the non-catalyticpathway from quinone to melanin [1], [27], [28]. Because theproduct of PO is highly toxic, it is necessary to keep the proPOsystem under strict control to avoid deleterious effects of anactivated proPO system, principally the redox enzyme PO. Severalfactors that can control this system have been described, includinga multitude of proteinase inhibitors [1], [28], [29]. Moreover, ifPO is generated, the melanization inhibition protein (MIPs) caninhibit melanin formation [4], [5]. Another way to protect againstthe inappropriate activation of proPO is to keep this proenzymeand its activation cascade in separate subcellular compartments.Thus, all arthropod proPOs are produced as leaderless proteinsand are presumably located in the cytoplasm, whereas theactivation system (proPO-AS) is located in secretory granules incrustaceans. This arrangement is similar to that of IL-1b, which isformed as a precursor in the cytoplasm and is then released to theoutside of the cell during or after activation. Because caspase-1cleavage is necessary for this activation and release steps andbecause such cleavage has been shown to be of importance for thesecretion of several leaderless proteins [5], we looked for caspase-1cleavage sites in proPO. We identified a new important regulatorof the proPO system, caspase-1-like activity, which can efficientlycleave proPO at two cleavage sites and make the enzymecatalytically inactive. Moreover, we found that the N-terminalproducts of this cleavage have effects on bacterial clearance. Thereare no previous reports of inflammasomes in invertebrates, andNOD-like receptors (NLRs), which are part of the vertebratecaspase-1-activating inflammasome complex, have not been foundin invertebrate genomes except that of the sea urchin [17].However, both vertebrates and invertebrates express severalpattern recognition receptors, and there might be other stillundiscovered inflammasome sensor molecules responsible for theactivation of invertebrate caspase-1-like activity. Recently, thestructure of a Drosophila apoptosome composed of the Apaf-1-likeprotein Dark was reported. After binding to Dark, the initiatorcaspase Dronc cleaves the caspase DrICE and initiates an intrinsiccell death pathway [30]. The NLR-inflammasome and differentapoptosomes are all examples of the oligomerization of CARDdomain proteins involved in caspase activation, and their roles incell death and immune responses are only beginning to beFigure 3. Ca2+dependence of proPO-casp release and theinhibitory effect of a caspase-1 inhibitor and caspase-1knockdown in vitro. Granular cells (GC) were incubated in buffercontaining different concentrations of Ca2+. The presence of proPO-casps outside the cells was examined in medium at 30 and 60 min. Therelease of proPO-casps was Ca2+and time dependent (A) and wasinhibited when the cells were preincubated for 30 min with thecaspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK prior to Ca2+addition (B). The caspase-1-like transcript was completely decreased after 65 h of caspase-1dsRNA (dsCaspase-1) treatment when compared to the dsGFP control(C). The level of proPO-casp fragments were decreased in both celllysate and medium in dsCaspase-1 treated group when compared todsGFP (D).doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004059.g003Caspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-SystemPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059understood. Our discovery may add the proPO system to the list ofimmune responses balanced by such caspase regulation.The activation of proPO by ppA occurs via proteolytic cleavagenear the N-terminal, and a peptide of approximately 20 kDa isreleased during this process. Once activated, the PO activity mustbe strictly localized to where melanization is needed. In analogywith the complement system in vertebrates, we asked whether thecleaved activation peptide also has biological activities, as C3-cleaved peptides do.To study whether this peptide (proPO-ppA) and the fragmentsresulting from caspase cleavage are involved in bacterial clearance,we injected E. coli together with these different fragmentsseparately into crayfish and measured the number of bacteria inthe hemolymph after the injection. Interestingly, all three peptideshad the ability to decrease the bacterial number in the hemolymphcompared to the injection of a control protein. To furtherinvestigate the mechanisms of action of these three peptides, weincubated each peptide directly with E. coli to identify any putativeFigure 4. Bacterial clearance.

Thefollowing were mixed with E. coli and injected separately: Tris-HCl (buffer control), proPO-ppA, proPO-casp1, proPO-casp2 and GFP (protein control).The relative number of E. coli in units of CFU/ml was calculated as the number for the specific fragments compared with the number for Tris-HCl.

The observation of antibacterialactivity in vitro suggests that the observed antimicrobial activitywas a result of this peptide itself, whereas the proPO-casp1 andproPO-casp2 seem to require other components in crayfish topromote bacterial clearance. After incubation with the proPO-ppA fragment, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteriawere found to be heavily agglutinated. Moreover, live/deadstaining of proPO-ppA-incubated E. coli revealed that theagglutinated bacteria contained a high percentage of dead cells.The generation of a highly antibacterial peptide after cleavage issimilar to the case of hemocyanin, for which proteolytic cleavagein the crayfish plasma produces astacidin 1 [31]. These findingscorrespond to the antimicrobial function of human eosinophilcationic protein (ECP). Incubation with ECP can cause bacterialagglutination and decreased viability. One further example is theC-terminal region of human extracellular superoxide dismutase(SOD), which also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [32], [33].The SEM study showed that the antibacterial effect of proPO-ppA seemed to be on the bacterial cell wall. The cell wall appearedto shrink in the presence of proPO-ppA and then the E. coli cellswere flattened. This antimicrobial activity is similar to the activityof funnel web spider venom on Shigella sp. [34].We present new findings that may explain how the proPOsystem is regulated and how its activity is localized (Figure 7). AfterppA cleavage, the small N-terminal proPO-ppA peptide causes theagglutination of bacteria at the site of infection, and PO activitythen may localize melanization to these bacterial aggregates. Wealso provide evidence that the release of proPO, a leaderlessprotein, from cells may involve caspase-1-like activity, similar tothat regulating IL-1brelease. Furthermore, caspase-1-like cleavageof proPO inactivates the enzyme and generates two N-terminalfragments with bacterial clearing activity. These findings show thatproPO is a multifunctional protein, with a phenoloxidase in the C-terminal region and an agglutinating and antimicrobial peptide inthe N-terminal region, as well as N-terminal proPO-casps peptideswith distinct biological activities.Materials and MethodsAnimalsFreshwater crayfish (P. leniusculus) was purchased and reared in aclosed system at 10uC. Only healthy animals were used for theexperiments.AntibodiesThe antibody against human procaspase-1 and p20 subunit waspurchased from Invitrogen. The antibody against kazal proteaseinhibitor (KPI) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-46652).The ECL peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (species-specific whole Ab) was purchased from GE Healthcare. Theperoxidase-linked anti-goat IgG antibody (whole molecule) waspurchased from Sigma. The FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbitIgG (whole molecule, affinity isolated antigen-specific antibody)was purchased from Sigma.ProPO antibodiesTo produce antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminalpeptides of proPO, proPO-N 1\u201376 and proPO-C 621\u2013694 werecloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (GEHealthcare). Then, these plasmids were subsequently transformedinto Escherichia coli cells (BL21), and a single colony was grown inLB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin to OD600 = 0.5 andinduced with 0.2 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 6 hat 20uC. Recombinant GST-fusion proteins were purified usingTable 1.

Then, the free recombinantpeptides were eluted with PBS from the column. Two milligramsof recombinant proPO-N or proPO-C was used for the productionof rabbit antiserum. The anti-proPO-N and anti-proPO-Cantibodies were purified from the rabbit antiserum usingGammaBind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) following the manu-facturer\u2019s instructions.Immunostaining for proPO in granular cells (GCs)GCs were separated using a 70% Percoll gradient in 0.15 MNaCl. The separated cells were resuspended in 0.15 M NaCl,seeded on coverslips, fixed and treated as described previously[35]. The immunostaining was performed using an antibodyagainst the N-terminus of proPO (5 ng/ml, 1:160) and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:300). In addition, an antibodyagainst a crayfish kazal protease inhibitor (KPI) was also used tocounter stain hemocyte granules. The slides were mounted withVECTASHIELD mounting medium containing DAPI (VectorLaboratories). The stained cells were then observed under afluorescence microscope.Hemocyte lysate and protein sample preparationThe hemolymph was centrifuged at 10006g for 5 min at 4uC,and the hemocyte pellet was collected and washed two times withPBS. Then, hemocytes were lysed in PBS containing 2% TritonX-100 [15] and 16 protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Mini,EDTA-free, Roche). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,0006 gfor 15 min at 4uC, and the supernatant was collected. The proteinconcentration was determined, and 20 mg of protein was mixedwith Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8).Detection of caspase-1-like protein in crayfishThe presence of caspase-1-like protein was first examined incrayfish hemocyte lysate (20 mg protein) by western blotting usingan antibody against human caspase-1. The hemocyte lysate wasprepared as described above. In addition, the amount of thecaspase-1-like protein in crayfish plasma was also determined inFigure 7. Hypothetical model of caspase-1 regulation of the proPO-AS. The proPO-AS is known to be localized to granules of the hemocytesand released by exocytosis after activation by microbial polysaccharides, while the final component proPO lacks a signal peptide and is located to thecytoplasm. In this paper we show that a caspase-1 like enzyme is involved in a Ca2+ -dependent release of proPO from the hemocytes and if proPO isnot cleaved by the ppA then Caspase1-like enzyme will cleave proPO into two fragments that exhibit bacterial clearance activity and at the same timeinactivate the melanin producing enzyme PO. Moreover we show that the peptide that is produced upon activation of proPO to PO by ppA possesshigh antibacterial and agglutinating activity. In summary this figure shows a putative mechanism for how the ProPO-system is localized to specificsites and is rapidly inactivated to prevent the spread of this dangerous enzyme.

To perform this experiment, crayfish (N = 3 for each group)were injected with 0.15 M NaCl, non-virulent E. coli or highlyvirulent A. hydrophila B1 [38], and hemolymph was collected at 1 hafter injection. Hemocytes were removed from the hemolymph bycentrifugation at 10006 g for 5 min at 4uC. Then, 200 mg ofplasma protein was loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels andsubjected to western blotting as previously described [35]. Thepresence of caspase was detected using a rabbit anti-caspaseantibody (1:3000) and ECL peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbitIgG (GE Healthcare) (1:7500). The detection of actin was alsoperformed as a loading control using a goat anti-actin antibody(1:5000) and an anti-goat secondary antibody (1:5000).Caspase-1 activity assayTo determine caspase-1 activity, Ac-YVAD-pNA (Santa Cruz),a synthetic peptide and substrate for caspase-1, was used.Hemolymph was collected at 1 h after injection of 0.15 M NaCl,E. coli or A. hydrophila B1. Cell-free plasma samples were preparedas described above. Then 50 ml of plasma was mixed with 200 nMof Ac-YVAN-pNA in the presence or absence of the caspase-1inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK (50 mM). The mixtures were incubatedat 37uC for 1.5 h, and the absorbance was determined at 405 nM.The plasma without substrate was used as a negative control foreach sample. The caspase-1 activity was reported as OD405/gplasma protein.Caspase-1 cleavage site predictionTo determine if there are any potential caspase-1 cleavage sitesin P. leniusculus proPO, the amino acid sequence of proPO(GenBank: CAA58471) was analyzed using the bioinformatics toolPeptideCutter (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/).PO activity assay and detection of proPO-casp fragmentsin crayfish plasmaE. coli and A. hydrophila B1 were used to induce PO activity invivo. Bacteria (1\u201336107 CFU/100 ml) suspended in 0.15 M NaClwere injected into the crayfish (N = 5). The hemolymph was thencollected before and 1 and 3 h after injection and centrifuged at10006 g for 5 min to remove the hemocytes. Then, 30 ml of thecell-free plasma was used in a PO activity assay. The plasma wasincubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) with 20 ml of3 mg/ml L-DOPA and 50 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).The PO activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at490 nm, and a reaction mixture without substrate served as thebaseline.Cell-free plasma (250 ml) was centrifuged at 110,0006g at 4uCfor 1.5 h to remove hemocyanin and 180 ml of the supernatantwas subjected to acetone precipitation. Then, 1.6 mg of proteinfrom each sample was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, and theproPO-casps were detected by western blotting as described aboveusing antibodies against the N-terminus or C-terminus of proPO.Detection of proPO-casp release in vitroBecause proPO is highly expressed in GCs, separated GCs wereused in these experiments. The GCs were resuspended in 0.15 MNaCl and seeded into 96-well plates. After attachment for 10 min,the cells were incubated at RT in 10 mM HEPES-0.2 M NaClbuffer (pH 6.8) containing different concentrations of CaCl2 (0, 1,or 10 mM). Then, 50 ml of buffer was collected from each wellafter 30 and 60 min and subjected to TCA precipitation. Theprotein pellets were dissolved in the same volume of Laemmlisample buffer and analyzed by western blotting using antibodiesagainst the N-terminus (1:3000) or C-terminus (1:3000) of proPOas described above.To investigate the effect of the caspase-1 inhibitors, Z-YVAD-FMK (Tocris Bioscience) and Ac-WEHD-FMK (Santa Cruz) onproPO-casp release, GCs were incubated with 75 ml of HEPES-NaCl containing the inhibitor (0, 1, 10, or 50 mM) for 30 minbefore the addition of 75 ml of HEPES-NaCl containing 2 mMCaCl2. Then, the buffer was collected at 30 and 60 min, and thesamples were prepared and analyzed as described above.Knockdown of Caspase-1-like protein in vitroTo knockdown crayfish caspase-1, double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) was synthesized with MEGAScript Kit (Ambion) andthe template was amplified using the following primers (T7promoter sequence is in italic); for dsCaspase-1 59-TAATACGACT-CACTATAGGGACCTGTGGACCGACCTAGTGC-39 and 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTCGGGCCTTTAGTTGGAC-ACC-39, dsGFP: 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACGTA-AACGGCCACAAGT-39 and 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-GTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-39. The purified dsRNAs(1 mg/well) were then added to granular cells and maintained in25% L-15 medium in 0.15 M NaCl at 16uC for 65 h (50% ofmedium was changed once at 48 h). The cells were then treatedwith 10 mM Ca2+for 3 h to induce caspase-1 release. Next thecells were washed with 25% L-15 medium four times and thenmaintained in the medium for another 24 h to allow the cells toproduce new caspase-1. Later, the cells were treated with 10 mMCa2+again, and same volume of medium was collected from eachwell at 60 min after incubation. In addition the granular celllysate was also prepared from the 60-min Ca2+treated cells. Thesamples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the proPO-caspfragments and caspase-1 like protein were detected by westernblotting.Cloning and recombinant protein expressionProPO-ppA was amplified from P. leniusculus hemocyte cDNAusing the following primers: proPO32EcoRI-F, (59 TTTTT-TGAATTCCAGGTGACCCAGAAGTTGCTGAGGA 39) andproPOppA-R, (59 CGCCTCGAGCTACCTGTTCACTTCAA-CCTGCATGCTT 39). The PCR product was visualized byagarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel and purifiedbefore being ligated into the pET32a expression vector betweenthe EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The protein was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. After the IPTG induction, theproteins, which were expressed in inclusion bodies, were refoldedand purified with Ni-affinity chromatography.Further, proPO-casp1 and proPO-casp2 were amplified usingproPO-F (59 CATGCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCA-TCAGGTGACCCAGAAGTTGCTGAGGA 39) and proPO-casp-R1 (59 CGCCTCGAGCTAATCTGCCTCAAACGCGT-CTCCTAAG 39) for proPO-casp1 and proPOcasp-R2 (59CGCCTCGAGCTAGTCGTGACAGAATGCCAGCAGCACA39) for proPO-casp2. Both PCR products were ligated into thepET28b expression vector between the NcoI and XhoI restrictionsites and expressed in the E. coli expression system as describedabove. Bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication, and therecombinant proteins were purified with Ni-affinity chromatogra-phy and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4uC.In vivo bacterial clearanceBacterial and protein injections were performed as follows.Briefly, wild-type E. coli were harvested at the mid-log phase,washed six times with 150 mM NaCl at 12006g for 5 min andCaspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-SystemPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/resuspended in 150 mM NaCl at 16109 CFU/ml. Bacterialsuspensions (100 ml) were mixed with 20 mg of recombinantprotein or 20 mM Tris-HCl and injected into the crayfish at thebase of a walking leg. At 40 min and 3 h after injection,hemolymph was collected, serially diluted with 150 mM NaCland plated on LB agar. The plates were incubated at 37uCovernight. The number of bacterial colonies was counted, and thenumber of CFU per ml was calculated for each treatment.In vitro bacterial clearanceTo investigate whether the bacterial clearance activity was adirect effect of the protein fragments, we performed an in vitrobacterial clearance assay as follows. E. coli were prepared asdescribed above, and 100 ml of resuspended E. coli was mixed with20 mg of recombinant protein. Then, the volume was adjusted to1 ml with 150 mM NaCl. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hourat room temperature with mild agitation, serially diluted andplated onto LB agar to calculate the CFU per ml. The plates wereobserved under a microscope.Agglutination assayThe minimum protein concentration for bacterial agglutinationwas tested as previously described [39]. The bacteria used in theexperiment were Staphylococcus aureus Cowan, Micrococcus luteus MIII, E. coli D21, A. hydrophila B1, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa OT97.Overnight cultures of bacteria were collected and washed threetimes in 150 mM NaCl. Each bacterial species was resuspended,and the optical density was adjusted to 2. The recombinantproteins were twofold serially diluted, and 50 ml of each dilutionwas mixed with 50 ml of bacterial suspension and incubated atroom temperature for 1 hour.Bacteria viability assayE. coli and protein mixtures were prepared as described for thein vitro bacterial clearance assay. After 5 min of incubation,SYTO9 (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 50 nM,and propidium iodide (PI) was added to a final concentration of1 mg/ml. Then, the samples were visualized with a fluorescencemicroscope.SEM analysisE. coli at O.D. 0.5 (100 ml) was incubated with 20 mg of theproPO-ppA peptide for 40 min at room temperature with mildagitation. After incubation, the bacteria were harvested and fixedwith glutaraldehyde following standard procedures for SEM.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Inhibitory effect of Ac-WEHD-FMK, a cas-pase-1 inhibitor. Granular cells (GC) were incubated in buffercontaining different concentrations of Ca2+. The presence ofreleased proPO-casps was examined at 60 min. The release ofproPO-casps was inhibited when the cells were preincubated for30 min with the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-FMK prior toCa2+addition. In addition, the proPO level inside the cell wasincreased in the presence of the inhibitor.(TIF)Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: MJ CN SN PJ IS KS.
