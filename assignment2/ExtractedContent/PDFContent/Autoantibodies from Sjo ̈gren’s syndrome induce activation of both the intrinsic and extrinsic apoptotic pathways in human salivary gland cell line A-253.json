It is known that autoantibodies can enter viable cells and thisphenomenon has functional consequences including activation of apoptotic process. The objective of this work was to explore whether autoan-tibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptotic process in an experimental model represented by the human salivary glandcell line A-253. To define if the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways are activated, we examined which caspases are critical for inducing cell death.The results have demonstrated that morphological changes and DNA laddering, consistent with apoptotic cell death, occurred in A-253 cellstreated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren sera. Sjo\u0308gren IgG induced cleavage and activation of the effector caspase-3 and degradation of the caspase-3substrate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9cleavages occurred. In conclusion, autoantibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of the A-253 cell line in acaspase-dependent manner.\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

S syndrome is an autoimmune rheumatic diseasethat targets salivary and lachrymal glands, leading to glandu-lar atrophy characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca andxerostomia [7e9]. SS may occur alone, defined as primarySS, or in association with other autoimmune diseases, suchas rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)or scleroderma, when it is defined as secondary SS [10].Although there is a high correlation between the pres-ence of serum autoantibodies and the development of SS,it is still unclear why cellular components, participatingmailto:m.sisto@anatomia.uniba.ithttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/0896841139M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49in important biosynthetic and structural functions, are tar-geted for autoimmune reactions, and the exact role of theseantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain.The association of apoptosis with autoantibodies produc-tion is of recent interest, in fact numerous diseases of definiteor possible autoimmune aetiology have lately been shown todisplay abnormalities in apoptosis [11]. Apoptosis or pro-grammed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process that as-sures cellular exchange; this natural machinery eliminates theapoptotic material present in blebs and apoptotic bodies [12].Studies performed over the last years have demonstrated thatthe caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-directed proteases, play a critical role in the initiation andexecution of apoptosis [13]. Caspases are synthesized asinactive zymogens that become activated by cleavage viaupstream proteases and, once activated, lead to cell deathvia two distinct caspase-dependent pathways. The firstinvolves the death receptor, or extrinsic pathway, which isinitiated by TNF-receptor family members and involves theactivation of initiator caspase-8 and/or caspase-10. The alter-native intrinsic pathway, dependent on Fas and various cellstress stimuli, triggers the cell death process via mitochon-drial release of Cytochrome c and the activation of initiatorcaspase-9. The active forms of caspase-8 and caspase-9cleave and activate the downstream effectors caspase-3,caspase-6, and caspase-7 [14e16]. Once activated, caspasescleave a variety of intracellular polypeptides of cytoplasmicand nuclear localization, such as poly(ADP-ribose)polymer-ase (PARP) and these scissions disrupt survival pathwaysand disassemble architectural components of the cell, contrib-uting to the morphological and biochemical changes thatcharacterize apoptotic cell death. Data in literature have dem-onstrated that in autoimmune conditions the caspases are overactivated [17] and the tolerance is broken by different factors,including an inappropriate removal of apoptotic material.This impairment promotes an antigen-driven response againstintracellular antigens [18]. In the past few years, the expres-sion of the apoptosis-regulating protein in the salivary glandsof SS patients has been reported, suggesting a role for apo-ptotic cell death in the pathogenesis of glandular damage inthis autoimmune disease [19]. Several authors have demon-strated that in SS there is an increased apoptosis of salivarygland epithelium, together with the expression of Fas andFasL, suggesting the induction of PCD through a classicFaseFasL interaction [17]. In addition, in SS the glandularepithelium is increasingly sensitive to apoptosis, in contrastto the resistance to PCD exhibited by the infiltrating glandu-lar lymphocytes [17,20]. At present, the mechanisms underly-ing the glandular tissue destruction observed in SS patientsare not fully understood. Our goal in this research was todemonstrate that, in an experimental model represented bythe human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoantibodies con-tained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera directed against cel-lular antigens trigger the apoptotic process. In addition, byexamining which caspases are critical for inducing cell death,we show that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic path-ways are activated.2. Materials and methods2.1. A-253 cell cultureA-253 cells from human epidermoid carcinoma of the sub-maxillary gland (American Type Culture Collection, number:HTB-41) were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5a modified medium(GIBCO, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bo-vine serum (FBS; SIGMA, MO, USA), 1% (v/v) antibiotic so-lution (100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin)(SIGMA), 2 mM L-glutamine (SIGMA) and incubated in ahumidified 5% CO2e95% air incubator at 37\ufffdC.2.2. Patients and controlsSera were obtained from nine healthy volunteers and ninepatients with primary Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, all fulfilling theAmericaneEuropean Consensus Group Classification criteriafor SS [1]. None of the patients examined met the clinical orserological criteria for additional connective tissue disease.None of the patients suffered from acute viral or bacterial in-fections at the time of the study. Informed consent for studiesinvolving human subjects was obtained and the studies wereconducted according to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki.2.3. Preparation and purification of human IgGIgG was obtained from Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera by precip-itation with ammonium sulphate at 50% (w/v), followed bythree washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and repreci-pitation with 33% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The resultingprecipitate was submitted to dialysis against phosphate buffer,pH 7.4, at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Subsequently, IgG was purified onprotein G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden)as recommended by the manufacturer. The IgG containingeluates, spectrophotometrically evaluated (l\u00bc 280), wereconcentrated to 20 mg/ml.2.4. ELISA autoantibodies\u2019 testsThe nine Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera, processed to obtain IgGfractions, were chosen submitting them to indirect solid phaseenzyme immunoassays to detect autoantibodies against nu-clear protein SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (ENA combi, ELISAkit, DIAMEDIX, FL, USA), autoantibodies against nuclearantigens SSA-52 (Ro 52), SSA-60 (Ro 60), SSB (La), RNP/Sm, RNP-70 Kd, RNP-A, RNP-C, Sm-BB0, Sm-D, Sm-E,Sm-F, Sm-G, Scl-70, Jo-1, dsDNA, ssDNA, poly-nucleosome,mono-nucleosome, histone-complex, Histone H1, HistoneH2A, Histone H2B, Histone H3, Histone H4, PM-Scl-100,Centromere B (ANA Detect ELISA kit, DIAMEDIX, FL,USA), and autoantibodies directed against the cytoskeletalprotein a-fodrin (Anti-Alpha Fodrin detection kit, DIAME-DIX). Briefly, prediluted controls and patient samples wereplaced in microtiter plates precoated with the above-mentioned antigens. After 30 min incubation at room40 M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49temperature, an HRP-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulinG was added to each well to detect specific autoantibodies con-tained in the control and patient sera. The same bioassay wasused for the detection of autoantibodies in the control and patientIgG fractions. The colorimetric reaction was performed usingtetramethylbenzidine, a chromogenic substrate oxidised byHRP. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, theoptical density was measured at 450 nm with an automatedmicroplate reader. The amount of colour was directly propor-tional to the concentration of autoantibodies present in samples.2.5. Internalization of autoantibody byimmunofluorescenceThe internalization of SS IgG by A-253 cells was studiedby fluorescence microscopy. The A-253 cells (1\ufffd 106 cells/well) were distributed in well microculture plates (Nunc, Den-mark) in which a 175-mm cellocate glass (Eppendorf, Ger-many) had been previously placed. The cells were incubatedwith SS IgG (200 mg/ml) at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h. After washingwith PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformalde-hyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v)Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The fixed cells were then in-cubated with goat anti-human IgG-FITC antibody (sc-2456;1:200; from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) at roomtemperature for 40 min. Intracellular IgG were observed undera fluorescence microscope. To confirm the internalization ofautoantibodies cells were pretreated for 2 h with cytochalasinD (15 mg/ml) and then treated with SS IgG for 2 h at 37 \ufffdC.Healthy IgG were used as control.2.6. A-253 cell treatmentTo evaluate the apoptosis, cell cultures were subjected todifferent treatments as follows: (1) treatment with IgG fractions(200 mg/ml) purified from healthy sera (H IgG) for 48 h; (2)treatment with IgG fractions (200 mg/ml) purified from Sjo\u0308grensera (SS IgG) for 48 h; (3) treatment with IgG (200 mg/ml) pu-rified from healthy sera for 48 h after pre-incubation for 2 hwith cytochalasin D (SIGMA) (15 mg/ml) an agent disruptingcytoskeletal filaments; and (4) treatment for 48 h with IgG pu-rified from Sjo\u0308gren sera (200 mg/ml) after pre-incubation for2 h with cytochalasin D (15 mg/ml). Controls included both un-treated cells and cells incubated for 48 h with the pro-apoptoticagent actinomycin D (SIGMA) (5 mg/ml).2.7. Determination of apoptosis2.7.1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of A-253cell apoptosisTo detect apoptotic cells, the Vibrant Apoptosis assay kit(Molecular Probes, Inc., OR, USA) was employed. This assayuses the green fluorescent non-permeant nuclear dye YO-PRO-1 that is able to enter apoptotic cells and propidiumiodide (PI), that stains necrotic cells. After incubation on icefor 20 min, the cells were immediately observed under fluores-cence microscopy using a green reference filter (l\u00bc 490 nm)for YO-PRO-1 and a red reference filter (l\u00bc 530 nm) for PI.Apoptotic cells appear green-stained, necrotic cells appearred-stained, viable cells show little or no fluorescence. To de-termine the optimum concentration of Sjo\u0308gren IgG to employin the experimental procedure, the same YO-PRO-1 assay wasused. The A-253 cells were treated with growing concentra-tions of SS IgG (10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/ml) for 48 h. TheA-253 cells treated with the same concentrations of healthyIgG were used as control. The percentage of apoptotic cellswas determined by counting at least 100 cells.2.7.2. DNA fragmentation of A-253 cell lineDegradation of the A-253 cell line DNA was used as an in-dex of apoptosis. A-253 (107) cells from each treatment werewashed in PBS and lysed in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA,1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Then 1 ml of DNA-zol (Molecular Research Center Inc., OH, USA) was added tocells in the presence of proteinase K (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at37 \ufffdC. After centrifugation at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min at 10 \ufffdC,the supernatant was collected and RNAse A (20 mg/ml) wasadded for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC, in order to eliminate contaminatingRNA. The DNA extracted was precipitated in 100% (v/v) eth-anol and centrifuged at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min. Purified DNAwas dissolved in 8 mM NaOH, separated by electrophoresisin a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromidestaining.2.7.3. Caspase-3 activation analysisActive caspase-3 enzyme is a heterodimer composed of two17 kDa and two 11 kDa subunits derived from a 32-kDa pro-enzyme (pro-caspase-3) by cleavage at multiple aspartic acidsites. The caspase-3 precursor is firstly cleaved to producethe p11 subunit and the 20 kDa (p20) peptide. Subsequently,the p20 peptide is cleaved to generate the mature p17 subunit[21]. We adopted two different approaches to visualize theintracellular activation of caspase-3 during the apoptoticprocess, immunofluorescence and enzymatic assays. In theimmunofluorescence assay, treated A-253 cells were fixedfor 10 min in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde diluted in PBS plus0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. After treatment with 0.2% (w/v) bo-vine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min to minimizenon-specific absorption of antibodies, the coverslips were in-cubated, for 45 min at room temperature, with the rabbitanti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (pAb; 80806E; 1:1500;Pharmingen, Germany), specific for the 17 kDa subunit, andfor 30 min with the bovine anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (sc-2365;1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the slides weremounted and examined under a fluorescence microscope.The enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in lysates of A-253cells was evaluated using the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assaysystem (Promega Corporation, WI, USA). This assay is basedon the recognition of specific amino acid sequences bycaspase-3 and the proteolytic cleavage of DEVD-pNA bycaspase-3 into the chromophore p-nitroanline ( p-NA). Briefly,A-253 cells, treated as described in Section 2.6, were har-vested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysedwith a cell lysis buffer, according to the manufacturer\u2019s41M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49instructions. The amount of total proteins extracted was quan-tified by Bradford\u2019s method [22] and equal amounts (50 mg) ofproteins from the total cell lysate were used in the assay. Pro-tein lysates were transferred to a flat-bottomed microtitre plateand the reaction buffer plus the caspase-3 substrate DEVD (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde)-pNA were added. After 4 hof incubation at 37 \ufffdC, the caspase-3 activity was detected bymeasurement of the free p-nitroaniline ( p-Na), released bycleavage of the substrate, in an absorbance spectrophotometerat 405 nm. To assess the specificity of the reaction, the com-petitive inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK [valylalanylas-partic acid (VAD) fluoromethyl ketone (FMK), 20 mM] wasadded to the samples. The results are expressed as mean\ufffd SEof nine experiments performed in duplicate.2.7.4. Determination of caspases-8 and caspase-9enzymatic activityTo distinguish between the two major pathways of caspaseactivation possibly induced by autoantibodies from Sjo\u0308grensera, we evaluated caspases-8 and caspase-9 activity in A-253 cells submitted to the treatments as indicated above.The caspase-8 and caspase-9 colorimetric protease assay kits(BioSource International Inc., CA, USA) were used.Caspase-8, involved in the extrinsic pathway of caspaseactivation, exists in cells as a 55-kDa proprotein which isactivated to produce p18/p17 subunits. The caspase-8 precur-sor is firstly cleaved to produce the p17 subunit and the p20peptide. Subsequently, the p20 peptide is cleaved to generatethe mature p18 subunit. Caspase-9, activated in the intrinsicpathway of programmed cell death, exists in cells as an inac-tive 46 kDa proenzyme which is cleaved to active 35 and10 kDa subunits [21]. The kits are able to assay the amountof active caspase-8, that recognizes the IETD (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp) amino acid sequence, and the amount of active cas-pase-9 that recognizes the LEHD (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) aminoacid sequence. These amino acid sequences correspond tocleavage sites of the inactive 32 kDa caspase-3 precursor.The tests include a substrate for active caspase-8, IETD-pNA, composed of the chromophore p-nitroaniline ( p-NA)and a synthetic tetrapeptide IETD, and a substrate for activecaspase-9, LEHD-pNA, composed of the chromophore p-ni-troaniline ( p-NA) and a synthetic tetrapeptide LEHD. Briefly,treated cells (5\ufffd 106) were lysed with 50 ml of the cell lysisbuffer, followed by freezing and thawing cycles. For the assay,100 mg of protein lysates was mixed with caspase assaybuffers in a 96-well microtiter plate. Then, IETD-pNA orLEHD-pNA substrates were added to the wells and the micro-plate was incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h in the dark. Upon cleav-age of the substrate by active caspase-8 or caspase-9, free p-NA light absorbance was quantified using a microplate readerat l\u00bc 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of p-NA fromapoptotic samples or control samples allowed the determina-tion of caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity.2.7.5. Western blot analysisThe total cellular content of active caspase-3, caspase-8,caspase-9 and of the substrate of active caspase-3, PARP,was analysed by western blot. A-253 cells, treated as in Sec-tion 2.6, were washed twice, detached with ice-cold PBS, col-lected and centrifuged at 600\ufffd g for 10 min. The supernatantwas removed and the pellet was incubated with lysis buffer[1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mM TriseHCl, 137 mM NaCl,10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mM leupeptin hemisulfate salt,and 0.2 U/ml aprotinin] for 30 min on ice. After incubation,the obtained lysate was vortexed and then centrifuged at12 800\ufffd g for 10 min; the protein concentration in the super-natant was spectrophotometrically determined by Bradford\u2019sprotein assay, and the lysate was subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Pro-tein samples were diluted with sample buffer (0.5 M TriseHClpH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 5%(v/v) b2-mer-captoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and thenboiled for 3 min. Proteins (25 mg/lane) and prestained stan-dards (BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) were loaded on 10%(PARP) or 15% (all proteins except PARP) SDS-polyacryl-amide precast gels. All the experiments were carried out in du-plicate. After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins weretransferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membranes. A blotbuffer [20 mM Tris/150 mM glycine, pH 8, 20% (v/v) metha-nol] was used for gel and membrane saturation and blot. Theblot conditions were the following: 200 mA (constant amper-age), 200 V for 110 min. After the transfer to nitrocellulose,equal loading of each lane was confirmed by Ponceau S stain-ing. Blots were then blocked by PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.1% (v/v)Tween-20, 5% w/v non-fat dried milk for 1 h and washedthree times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20ePBS 1\ufffd (TePBS).Membranes were then incubated for 90 min with goat anti-caspase-3 pAb (sc-1225; 1:500), rabbit anti-PARP pAb(sc-7150; 1:500), rabbit anti-caspase-9 (sc-8355; 1:200), rabbitanti-caspase-8 (sc-7890; 1:500); all pAbs from Santa CruzBiotechnology. Bound Ab were visualized with bovine anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2370; 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)or rabbit anti-goat IgG-HRP (sc-2768; 1:5000; Santa CruzBiotechnology). Bands were visualized by 3,30-diaminobenzi-dine tetrahydrochloride (Fast DAB, SIGMA). The beta (b)-actin protein level was determined by western blot and usedas a protein loading control.2.8. StatisticsThe data were analysed for normality using the WilksShapiro Test. Differences in means for paired observationswere analysed by Student\u2019s t-test. In all instances values ofp< 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.3. Results3.1.

By contrast, A-253 untreated control cells(Fig. 5A) and cells treated with IgG purified from healthysera (Fig. 5C) did not show intracellular caspase-3 activation.Moreover, pretreatment with cytochalasin D preventedcaspase-3 activation induced by SS IgG cell treatment (datanot shown).Fig. 6 shows the active caspase-3 proteolytic activity mea-sured by the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assay system. A signif-icantly higher ( p< 0.01) caspase-3 enzymatic activity wasobserved in A-253 cells treated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren serain comparison with untreated control cells. No significant dif-ferences in caspase-3 activity were observed between A-253cells treated with IgG from healthy sera and untreated controlsera ( p> 0.05). A significant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-3 enzymatic activity was observed when A-253 cells werepretreated with cytochalasin D and then with SS IgG in com-parison with cells treated with SS IgG alone. The specificityof the reaction, assessed using the competitive inhibitor ofcaspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK was reliable because treatment withthis substance blocked DEVD-pNA cleavage (data notshown).3.7.

A-253cells treatment with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera led tothe activation of both of these caspases, involved in differentapoptotic pathways. In fact, a significantly higher ( p< 0.01)caspase-8 enzymatic activity was observed in IgG fromSjo\u0308gren sera-treated A-253 cells in comparison with untreatedcontrol cells. No significant differences in caspase-8 activitywere observed between A-253 cells treated with IgG fromhealthy sera and untreated control sera ( p> 0.05). A signifi-cant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-8 enzymatic activitywas observed when A-253 cells were treated with cytochalasinD plus SS IgG, in comparison with cells treated with SS IgGalone. The same results were observed for caspase-9 activa-tion, in fact, SS IgG treatment of A-253 cell line led to the ac-tivation of caspase-9, and the enzymatic activity of caspase-9was significantly higher ( p< 0.01) than in untreated controlcells and cells treated with H IgG. Moreover, caspase-945M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49activation following SS IgG treatment was significantly( p< 0.01) reduced when cytochalasin D was used.3.8. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce proteolyticcleavage of initiator and executor caspasesCleavage of the initiator caspases-8 and caspase-9 and ofthe effector caspase-3 and active caspase-3 substrate, PARP,was analysed by western blot. Western blot analysis ofcaspase-3 protein activation was performed using the anti-caspase-3 antibody, specific for peptide mapping at theC-terminus of the caspase-3 subunit p20, as a probe. Theantibody recognizes both the caspase-3 precursor andthe active caspase-3 subunit p20. The presence of the20 kDa band was evaluated in A-253 untreated control cellsand in cells treated with actinomycin D, IgG purified fromSjo\u0308gren sera, and IgG purified from healthy sera. The bandcorresponding to the p20 subunit detected in actinomycinD-treated cells was evident in SS IgG-treated cells as well.Only the caspase-3 precursor was detectable in untreated con-trol cells and in cells treated with H IgG (Fig. 8 panel A). Toconfirm caspase-3 activation, the expression of the 89 kDafragment of PARP, resulting from cleavage of endogenous116 kDa PARP by active caspase-3, was analysed. In A-253control cells and in cells treated with IgG from healthy do-nors, the full length 116 kDa PARP was expressed. Treatmentof A-253 with actinomycin D and with IgG from Sjo\u0308grenpatients induced the cleavage of the full length PARP in the89 kDa subunit (Fig. 8 panel B). Western blot analysis ofthe caspase-8 protein activation was performed using theanti-caspase-8 antibody, specific for the p20 subunit, whichis able to recognize both the inactive pro-caspase-8 and theactive p20 fragment. Pro-caspase-9 cleavage was revealedusing the anti-caspase-9 antibody, specific for the p35 activesubunit.

No proteolytic cleavage of the initiator caspaseswas observed following A-253 cells treatment with IgG puri-fied from healthy sera.4. DiscussionThis study was undertaken to determine whether autoanti-bodies against several antigens contained in IgG purifiedfrom Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptosis in human salivary glandcell line A-253. Our findings demonstrate that in A-253 cellsautoantibodies induce (1) the activation of both the intrinsicand the extrinsic apoptotic pathways; (2) then the cleavageand activation of effector caspase-3; and, finally, (3) morpho-logical changes typical of apoptosis. On the contrary, IgGpurified from healthy sera have no effects on A-253 cells.The ability of some autoantibodies to enter viable cells andreact with cellular antigens is accepted from several authors.In varying experimental models, both in vitro and in vivo, itABcaspase-8 assay0,00,20,40,60,81,01,21,4C Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+Cyt DSS IgG+Cyt Dcaspase-8 activitycaspase-9 assay0,00,20,40,60,81,01,21,4C Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+Cyt DSS IgG+Cyt Dcaspase-9 activityFig. 7.

Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49has been proven that antibodies to intracellular constituentscan enter living cell types from many tissues, causing variousfunctional alterations [23e36]. Autoantibodies that penetratelive cells include polyclonal and monoclonal anti-DNA[24,37e39], anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [23,40], anti-Ro[41,42], anti-La [43], anti-proteinase 3 [44], anti-synaptosomal[45], anti-neuronal [46,47], anti-ribosomal protein P [48], andanti-a-fodrin [49], a gene protein product of recent identifica-tion. In particular, it has been reported that polyclonal IgGanti-RNP isolated from autoimmune patients penetrate live hu-man peripheral blood mononuclear cells [40,23], keratinocytes[50] and epithelial cells [38]. Furthermore, human polyclonalanti-DNA IgG isolated from systemic lupus erythematosusserum penetrate and localize in the cell nucleus of peripheralblood T lymphocytes [28,51,52], human and murine renaltubular cells [53].Several mechanisms have been investigated for the penetra-tion of autoantibodies [23,53e55]; it has been proposed thatdifferent antibodies may preferentially use distinct penetrationpathways [27,53], including the engagement of Fc receptorson cells, originally described by Alarco\u0301n-Segovia et al. [23],or the cross-reaction of antibodies with proteins located onor near the cell surface such as myosin 1, a 110-kDa cell sur-face receptor, in the case of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies[56e58].Several findings suggest that there is a relationship betweenthe binding and penetration of autoantibodies into differentcell types and the initiation of events leading to various func-tional cellular alterations. Autoantibodies can thereby modifycell functions, arrest the progression of the cell cycle and ab-rogate the expression of some genes [33]. One of the most in-teresting effects of autoantibody penetration is the induction ofprogrammed cell death [24,28,35,46,47].Fig. 8. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in A-253 cells. Cell lysatesof A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15% for caspase-3and 10% for PARP) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for west-ern blot analysis. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies for caspase-3(panel A), PARP (panel B) and b-actin (panel C). Act, actinomycin D-treatedcells; C, untreated control cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified fromhealthy sera; SS IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.Growing evidence suggests that the deregulation of apopto-sis is involved in autoimmunity. Autoimmune diseases arecharacterized by aberrations in the repertoire of lymphocytesthat infiltrate target organs in response to autoantigens arisingfrom inappropriate apoptosis of target cells [59]. Often, thepresence of autoreactive lymphocytes is involved in the pro-gression of the autoimmune diseases triggered by autoanti-bodies\u2019 penetration [60e62]. Numerous investigations havefocused on the role of CD95/Fas in organ-specific autoimmu-nity as shown in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis [63], Grave\u2019s disease[64], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [65] and systemiclupus erythematosus [66]. In SLE there is evidence of anincrease of the soluble Fas mediator, that would inhibit theapoptotic process, but this feedback is not absolutely decisivefor autoimmune cell survival, because a high level of lympho-cyte apoptosis was concurrently found [67].Recently, research advances have supported the idea that,once they have penetrated cells, autoantibodies can be directlypathogenic and directly trigger the apoptotic pathway, depend-ing on their antigen specificity [68]. Shiraga and Adamusshowed that anti-retinal autoantibodies of the paraneoplasticretinopathy syndrome, specific to recoverin and to enolase,but not normal antibodies, can induce activation of the apopto-tic process via the intrinsic pathway in living retinal cells [69].Furthermore, DNA-specific autoantibodies can enter culturedmesangial cells [70], endothelial cells [71], and lymphoid cells[33], causing apoptosis.Apoptosis also seems to play a central role in the pathogen-esis of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome. S syndrome has been demon-strated to proceed along two pathological phases: an earlyphase in which the salivary and lachrymal tissues undergo in-appropriate PCD and a later phase of lymphocyte infiltrationand autoimmune aggression, in which further progressiveglandular destruction and functional disability occur [72].Fig. 9. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in A-253 cells. Celllysates of A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) andtransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot analysis. Blotswere probed with polyclonal antibodies for caspase-8 (panel A), caspase-9(panel B) and b-actin (panel C). Act, actinomycin D-treated cells; C, untreatedcontrol cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from healthy sera; SSIgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.47M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49Apoptotic death in SS may be mediated through the tumor ne-crosis factor-alpha receptor [73], CD95 [74,75] or the perforinpathway [3]. Recent observations have detected increased pro-teolytic activity in salivary epithelial cells, including that ofthe caspases, enzymes involved in the intracellular PCD, sup-porting the concept that excessive cell death contributes to thepathogenesis of this disease [76].At present, in Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, there are no evidencesof any correlation between autoantibody penetration of sali-vary epithelial cells and a direct role in causing apoptosis. Inthis report, we demonstrate that, in our experimental modelrepresented by a human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoan-tibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera, oncepenetrated into cells, are able to trigger cell death throughapoptotic mechanisms.Using YO-PRO-1 staining, we observed morphologicalchanges consistent with apoptotic cell death in A-253 cellstreated with SS IgG. DNA fragmentation into variable lengtholigonucleosomal fragments is one of the typical features ofapoptosis. Characteristic DNA laddering, observed in A-253cells treated with SS IgG, confirmed cellular apoptosis. Inhibi-tion of autoantibody internalization, by blocking endocytosisusing cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts cytoskeletal fila-ments, conserved the DNA integrity. In addition, to distinguishbetween the two major pathways of caspase activation, weevaluated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 proteolyticcleavage and activation in A-253 cells treated with SS IgG.In A-253 cells, the treatment with SS IgG-induced cleavageand activation of effector caspase-3, a key and pivotal execu-tioner protease, confirmed by cleavage of caspase-3 substratepoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) that is cleaved and inac-tivated when caspase-3 is activated. Colorimetric and westernblot analyses demonstrated that both the intrinsic and extrinsicpathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9cleavage occurred. Pretreatment of A-253 cells with cytocha-lasin D inhibited caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 cleavageand activation, confirming that this effect was caused by auto-antibody penetration. In the same experimental condition, IgGpurified from sera of healthy donors did not have the apoptoticeffect that SS IgG had.In conclusion, we have shown that autoantibodies containedin IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of a sali-vary gland cell line in a caspase-dependent manner, in whichboth the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways play a role. This maybe an important step towards finding more appropriate mea-sures for the treatment of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome. A better under-standing of the events responsible for the glandular damageoccurring in this autoimmune disease may allow new thera-peutic strategies to be instituted to prevent epithelial cell deathand the consequent impairment of the secretory function.AcknowledgementsWe thank Dr. Vincenzo Montinaro (Department ofNephrology, University of Bari, Italy) for his expert technicalassistance.
