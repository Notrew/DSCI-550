In a previous study, it wasdemonstrated that EHEC-induced IL-8 secretion is due to the involvement of the mitogen-activated proteinkinase (MAPK), AP-1, and NF-\ufffdB pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect of the yeast Saccharomycesboulardii on EHEC infection in T84 cells. For this purpose, cells were (i) incubated with bacteria and yeast atthe same time or (ii) incubated overnight with yeast cells that were maintained during infection or eliminatedby several washes before infection. Coincubation is sufficient to maintain the transmonolayer electricalresistance (TER) of EHEC-infected cells, whereas the preincubation of cells with the yeast without eliminationof the yeast during infection is necessary to significantly decrease IL-8 secretion. We thus analyzed themechanisms of S. boulardii action. We showed that S. boulardii has no effect on EHEC growth or on EHECadhesion. Kinetics studies revealed that EHEC-induced myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation precedesthe decrease of TER. ML-7, an MLC kinase inhibitor, abolishes the EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation anddecrease of TER. Studies show that S. boulardii also abolishes EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation. Wedemonstrated that the preincubation of cells with S. boulardii without washes before EHEC infection inhibitsNF-\ufffdB DNA binding activity, phosphorylation and degradation of I\ufffdB-\ufffd, and activation of the three membersof a MAPK group (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, p38, and c-jun N-terminal kinase).These findings demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts a preventive effect on EHEC infection by (i) interfering withone of the transduction pathways implicated in the control of tight-junction structure and (ii) decreasing IL-8proinflammatory secretion via inhibition of the NF-\ufffdB and MAPK signaling pathways in infected T84 cells.The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)-related bac-terium called enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a patho-genic bacterium that causes acute gastroenteritis and hemor-rhagic colitis that may lead to severe complications, includinghemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (15). EHEC infection ofintestinal cells triggers two major functional effects: inflamma-tion and disruption of barrier function.The in vivo study done by Westerholt et al. (29) correlatedinflammatory parameters in serum with a high risk of devel-oping typical HUS during the prodromal phase of diarrhea,caused by EHEC; low neopterin and interleukin-10 (IL-10)levels and high IL-8 levels are indicators of a high risk fordeveloping HUS in EHEC-infected children. A previous study(6) linked this in vivo study and an in vitro model and dem-onstrated that EHEC could induce a potent proinflammatoryresponse in vitro by IL-8 secretion in infected T84 cells. IL-8appears to be one of the major products secreted by infectedepithelial cells (10). This proinflammatory and chemoattrac-tant cytokine can recruit the polymorphonuclear cells into theinfected site and promote their infiltration of the epitheliallayer infected by invasive or noninvasive bacteria (18, 28).IL-8 gene expression is regulated by several pathways. TheIL-8 gene promoter region contains binding sequences forvarious transcription factors, including NF\u2013IL-6, NF-\ufffdB, andAP-1 (20). Elewaut et al. (11) found that NF-\ufffdB is a centralregulator of the epithelial-cell innate immune response to in-fection with enteroinvasive bacteria. Moreover, immune andinflammatory responses in the gut often involve the transcrip-tion factor NF-\ufffdB (22). In most cell types, NF-\ufffdB is inactive inthe cytoplasm through its binding to an inhibitory protein,called I\ufffdB, which masks the nuclear localization signal onNF-\ufffdB and thus prevents its nuclear translocation. The trans-location of NF-\ufffdB requires the phosphorylation of I\ufffdB-\ufffd; oncephosphorylated, I\ufffdB-\ufffd is ubiquitinylated and then degraded bythe 26S subunit of the proteasome (2). AP-1 activation isdependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) thatare central in many host responses, including the regulation ofcytokine responses, stress responses, and cytoskeletal reorga-nization (7, 8). MAPK form a group of three pathways, includ-ing those for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases(ERK1/2) and two stress-activated protein kinases named p38and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Most eukaryotic surfacereceptors use at least one of these highly conserved MAPKcascades for signaling inside the cell (26).In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the EHECability to elicit a proinflammatory response in infected T84cells was due to the involvement of the NF-\ufffdB, AP-1, andMAPK signaling pathways (6).EHEC infection can also alter intestinal permeability (25).Studies using T84 cells have demonstrated that increased my-osin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation is implicated in the* Corresponding author.

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and in-creased levels of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and cytosolic freecalcium have been reported in EHEC-infected epithelial cells(23, 33). By using the specific inhibitor of PKC, the link be-tween PKC activation and the decrease of TER was demon-strated in EHEC-infected T84 cells (25). The presence ofML-9, an inhibitor of MLCK (27), inhibits EPEC-inducedMLC phosphorylation and the TER decrease (33) and partiallyrestores TER in the case of EHEC infection (25). However,the effect of EHEC infection on MLC phosphorylation has notbeen yet investigated.Saccharomyces boulardii is a thermophilic, nonpathogenicyeast administered in western Europe for the prevention andtreatment of a variety of diarrheal diseases (19). Recently, itwas reported that S. boulardii prevented the EPEC-induceddisruption of barrier function in T84 cells (5). In this study, weshow that the yeast decrease the EPEC-induced activation ofthe ERK1/2 pathway. However, by the use of a pharmacolog-ical inhibitor, inhibition of ERK1/2 does not prevent theEPEC-induced decrease of TER, though this pathway is im-plicated in EPEC-induced IL-8 secretion (4). We thus hypoth-esized that S. boulardii may be able to attenuate differentsignaling pathways elicited by proinflammatory enteric patho-gens.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect ofS. boulardii on the different signaling pathways induced inEHEC-infected T84 cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines, media, and bacterial and yeast strains. The T84 human colonic cellline was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salis-bury, England). The T84 culture medium contained a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle medium and Ham\u2019s F12 medium (DMEM/F12) supple-mented with 50 \ufffdg of penicillin/ml, 50 \ufffdg of streptomycin (Sigma, Saint QuentinFallavier, France)/ml, and 4% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Bezons, France).The O157:H7 EHEC bacterial strain used in this study, EDL931, which producesShiga toxins 1 and 2 (14), was kindly provided by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France).Bacteria were stored in Luria-Bertani medium plus 15% glycerol at \ufffd80\u00b0C andgrown in Luria broth overnight at 37\u00b0C without shaking. The yeast S. boulardii(Laboratoires Biocodex, Paris, France) was grown at 37\u00b0C, with shaking, inHalvorston minimal medium with 2% glucose.Inhibitor. MLCK inhibitor ML-7 (Calbiochem, Meudon, France) was storedin 50% ethanol at 4\u00b0C.Electrical resistance measurements. T84 cells were grown on 4.6-cm2porousfilter membranes (0.4-mm pores; Nunc, Poly Labo Paul Block & Cie, Strasbourg,France). TER was measured with the Millicell-ERS apparatus purchased fromMillipore (Molsheim, France). Under these conditions, high TER values(\ufffd1,000 \ufffd \ufffd cm2) were consistently obtained in monolayers 14 days postseeding.Infection procedure. Bacteria, grown overnight in Luria broth medium, werepelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline(PBS), and added to cells (100 bacteria/cell) with or without the presence of yeast(10 yeast organisms/cell). The yeast-to-bacterium ratio did not modify intestinalcell viability (5). For infection of filter-grown cells, bacteria and yeast were addedto the apical compartment.IL-8 assay. IL-8 assays were performed at 70 to 90% confluence of T84monolayers grown in 60-mm-diameter petri dishes. Prior to any treatment, cellswere washed and incubated for at least 2 h in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM/F12 medium. After infection, the culture supernatants were centrifuged for 10min at 10,000 \ufffd g to pellet residual bacteria. The IL-8 concentration was deter-mined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the Quantikinehuman IL-8 immunoassay (R&D System, Abington, United Kingdom).Adhesion and growth assays. T84 cells were seeded in six-well plates. At 70 to90% confluence, cells were washed and infected in 2.5 ml of serum- and antibi-otic-free DMEM/F12 medium. Bacterial adhesion to T84 cells was quantified bythe plate dilution method as described previously (5). Briefly, bacteria present inthe culture medium were eliminated by extensive washes with sterile PBS. Cellswere then trypsinized and lysed in water containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin(Sigma). The cell lysates were serially diluted in sterile PBS and the appropriatedilution was plated in duplicate onto MacConkey sorbitol agar plates. Afterovernight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the number of CFU was counted. For growth assay,the culture supernatants were collected, and cells were lysed without the exten-sive washes with PBS. The cell lysates and the culture supernatants were thenpooled, for estimation of CFU.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). T84 cells were seeded in six-wellplates. At 70 to 90% confluence, cells were washed and infected in serum- andantibiotic-free DMEM-F12 medium. At the indicated times, the infected cellswere washed with PBS. AP-1 and NF-\ufffdB DNA binding activities were analyzedin total cleared cellular extracts prepared in totex buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH7.9], 350 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg ofaprotinin/ml). Samples (10 \ufffdg) were incubated for 25 min at 25\u00b0C with a radio-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 site (5\t-TTCGTGACTCAGCGG-3\t) or the \ufffdB site (5\t-GATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATG-3\t).The specificity of the complexes was analyzed by incubation with an excess ofunlabeled AP-1 or \ufffdB oligonucleotides. Complexes were separated by electro-phoresis on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5\ufffd Tris-borate-EDTA.The dried gels were autoradiographed (Amersham Hyperfilms, Orsay, France).Western blotting. T84 cells were seeded in 100-mm-diameter petri tissueculture dishes. At 70 to 90% confluence, cells were depleted overnight in serum-and antibiotic-free DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serumalbumin (Sigma). Infections were carried out in this medium. For phospho-MLCdetection, infections were performed on filter-grown cells. When indicated, cellswere pretreated for 1 h with ML-7 (5 \ufffdM) and then infected in the presence ofinhibitor. At the indicated times, the infected cells were washed with PBS andscraped at 4\u00b0C in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1%NP-40, 2 mM Na3Vo4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 \ufffdM aprotinin, 25 \ufffdM leupeptin, 1 \ufffdMpepstatin, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 5 mMNaPPi, 10 mM -glycerophosphate). The lysate was sonicated and solubilized for30 min at 4\u00b0C and then centrifuged at 14,000 \ufffd g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The proteinconcentration of the supernatant was determined by using Bio-Rad DetergentCompatible reagents.Equal amounts (50 \ufffdg) of whole-cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)\u201310% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were trans-ferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham) andincubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38,anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-phospho-I\ufffdB-\ufffd antibodies (New England Biolabs);anti-ERK2, anti-p38, anti-JNK, or anti- I\ufffdB-\ufffd antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech-nology, Santa Cruz, Calif.); or anti-phospho-MLC, followed by incubation withthe appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (NewEngland Biolabs). The presence of antibodies was revealed with the enhancedchemiluminescence detection system (Amersham).Statistical analysis. Results are presented as the mean \ufffd the standard error ofthe mean (SEM). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variancewith the StatView program for MacIntosh, followed by post hoc comparison withthe Bonferroni and Dunn tests.Densitometric analysis. The changes in signal or band intensity were quanti-fied by densitometric analysis by the National Institutes of Health Image pro-gram for MacIntosh. All experiments were repeated at least four times, and arepresentative result is shown for each experiment.RESULTSS. boulardii prevents the EHEC-induced decrease of T84monolayer resistance. To determine the effect of S. boulardiion the EHEC-induced decrease in TER, T84 monolayers wereapically infected with EHEC strain EDL931 alone or in thepresence of S. boulardii and TER was monitored over 12 h(Fig. 1). In a previous study, it was reported that over a 12-hincubation period, yeasts have no effect on TER (5). In EHEC-infected cells, monolayer resistance was unchanged up untilVOL. 71, 2003 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF S. BOULARDII 7676 h; at 9 and 12 h, it had dropped to 946 \ufffd 46 and 710 \ufffd 46\ufffd \ufffd cm2, respectively (P \ufffd 0.02 versus that for control mono-layers). When infection was performed in the presence of S.boulardii, the TER remained at the level of uninfected mono-layers up until 12 h of infection, indicating that the barrierfunction of infected cells was preserved in the presence of theyeast.S. boulardii effect on IL-8 release by infected T84 cells. Aprevious study demonstrated that a 6-h EHEC infection leadsto the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in T84cells (6). This study was conducted to investigate the effect ofS. boulardii on IL-8 production. First, we tested the effect of S.boulardii alone on IL-8 production. For this purpose, T84 cellswere incubated for 6 h or overnight with the yeast cells and theIL-8 concentration was determined in culture supernatants byELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, columns 2 and 3, S. boulardii alonedid not induce significant IL-8 release (respectively, 9 \ufffd 0 and33 \ufffd 4 pg/ml versus 10 \ufffd 1 pg/ml in control cells). By contrast,as reported previously (6), a 6-h incubation with EHEC in-duced IL-8 production (1,205 \ufffd 74 versus 10 \ufffd 1 pg/ml inuninfected cells [column 4]). To examine the effect of S. bou-lardii on EHEC-infected T84 cells, cells were coincubated withbacteria and the yeast for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2, column 5, S.boulardii did not induce a significant decrease in IL-8 secretion(723 \ufffd 88 pg/ml versus that for uninfected cells). Then, westudied a putative preventive effect of S. boulardii by overnightpreincubation of the yeast, followed by EHEC infection. Whenbacteria were added in the presence of the yeast (column 6), asignificant decrease of IL-8 production was observed (212 \ufffd 31versus 10 \ufffd 1 pg/ml in control cells). However, if infection wasperformed after the washout of yeast (column 7), the decreaseof IL-8 secretion was no longer observed (1,545 \ufffd 64 pg/mlversus 10 \ufffd 1 pg/ml). We performed control studies with heat-killed S. boulardii cells which showed no protective effect onIL-8 secretion induced by EHEC infection (data not shown).These results demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts a preven-tive effect on the production of IL-8 during EHEC infection ofT84 cells. In contrast to the results reported above on TER, tobe effective, the yeast should be added before infection andpresent during the infection process.Effect of S. boulardii on bacterial growth. First, we hypoth-esized that S. boulardii modify the bacterial growth duringinfection. For this purpose, T84 cells were infected with EHECalone or in presence of yeast, and bacteria were counted byserial dilutions and plated onto MacConkey agar plates. Thedata presented in Table 1 show that the growth of EHEC wasnot affected by the presence of S. boulardii.Effect of S. boulardii on bacterial adhesion. As adhesion tointestinal cells is the first step in EHEC pathogenicity, weinvestigated if S. boulardii could modify the bacterial adhesion.For this purpose, T84 cells were infected with EHEC alone orin the presence of yeast as described above for the growthassay. The data presented in Table 1 show that S. boulardii didnot change the number of adherent bacteria. Therefore, theanti-inflammatory effect of the yeast is not due to a slowergrowth of EHEC or to an impaired attachment of EHEC toFIG. 1. S. boulardii prevents the EHEC-induced decrease of TERin T84 cells. Resistance progressively decreased in cells infected byEHEC (\ufffd) but remained comparable to that of control monolayers(F) in cells infected in the presence of S. boulardii (\u25a0).

We thus hypothesized that the yeast might modifythe host cell response to EHEC infection.S. boulardii alters EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation.MLC phosphorylation has been implicated and correlated withthe decrease of TER in T84 cells infected by EPEC (33). In thecase of infection by EHEC, the use of ML-9, an MLCK inhib-itor, partially restores the decrease of TER (25). However, todate, phosphorylation of MLC has not been demonstrated inEHEC-infected cells. For this purpose, we performed kineticsstudies to determine the time of appearance of the phosphor-ylated form of MLC in EHEC-infected T84 cells. Westernblotting with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylatedform of MLC revealed that MLC was not phosphorylated inuninfected polarized T84 cells (control lane) or in cells duringthe beginning (1 h) of infection (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylatedform of MLC appeared after 3 h of infection and increased at6 h of infection. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of 5 \ufffdMML-7 totally prevented MLC phosphorylation. The blot wasprobed with antibody recognizing the nonphosphorylated formof ERK2 to rule out a change between levels of whole-celllysates. These data indicate that MLCK is implicated in thephosphorylation of MLC. We thus attempted to correlateMLC phosphorylation and the decrease in TER. TER wasmeasured in cells infected in the presence of 5 \ufffdM ML-7. Datashown in Table 2 indicate that ML-7 abolishes the EHEC-induced decrease of TER, thus implicating MLC phosphory-lation in the control of TER. Since MLC phosphorylation wasimplicated in the TER decrease, we performed experiments todetermine the effect of S. boulardii on MLC phosphorylation.Data presented in Fig. 3B demonstrate that S. boulardii alonedid not induce phosphorylation of the protein. The presence ofyeast during the infection abolished the phosphorylation ofMLC early during the period of infection (3 h) as well as lateron, after 6 h of infection. These data indicate that the yeast canmodulate this signaling pathway implicated in tight-junctioncontrol.Effect of S. boulardii on the NF-\ufffdB signaling pathway. Aprevious study demonstrated that EHEC induces IL-8 secre-tion in infected T84 cells via activation of the NF-\ufffdB andMAPK pathways (6). To understand the mechanism involvedin S. boulardii protection, we investigated the effect of S. bou-lardii on NF-\ufffdB activation induced by EHEC in infected T84cells. As shown in Fig. 4, S. boulardii alone did not induce theDNA binding of NF-\ufffdB in T84 cells (lanes 3 and 4). Thecoincubation of EHEC with the yeast on cells (lane 6) and theovernight preincubation of cells with yeast followed by washesbefore EHEC infection (lane 8) did not inhibit the NF-\ufffdBFIG. 3.

The control lanes correspond to uninfectedcells. Identical results were obtained at least three times. The changesin signal intensity were quantified by densitometric analysis.TABLE 1.

However, the overnight pre-incubation of cells with S. boulardii followed by EHEC infec-tion in the presence of yeast (lane 7) diminished the NF-\ufffdBDNA binding induced by EHEC (shown by densitometric anal-ysis). Translocation of NF-\ufffdB requires the phosphorylation ofI\ufffdB-\ufffd and subsequent degradation of I\ufffdB-\ufffd by the 26S pro-teasome (2). Phosphorylation of I\ufffdB-\ufffd was analyzed by West-ern blotting with antibodies that recognize the phosphorylatedform of I\ufffdB-\ufffd. As shown in Fig. 5A, phosphorylation of I\ufffdB-\ufffdoccurs in the same conditions as NF-\ufffdB DNA binding and isalso inhibited by the overnight preincubation of cells with S.boulardii followed by the EHEC infection procedure in thepresence of yeast. We next studied the degradation of I\ufffdB-\ufffd byWestern blotting with antibodies against its whole form (Fig.5B). The overnight preincubation with S. boulardii followed byEHEC infection in the presence of yeast decreased by 40% theI\ufffdB-\ufffd degradation in infected T84 cells.Altogether, these results demonstrated that the yeast S. bou-lardii abolished the NF-\ufffdB pathway activation induced byEHEC in T84 cells by interfering with I\ufffdB-\ufffd phosphorylationand degradation.Effect of S. boulardii on the MAPK pathway. A previousstudy showed that IL-8 secretion induced by EHEC also de-pends on MAPK activation (6). Therefore, we performedWestern blot analysis with antibodies directed against thephosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6A), p38 (Fig. 6B), andJNK (Fig. 6C). Blots were probed with antibody recognizingthe nonphosphorylated form of ERK2, p38, and JNK to ruleout a change between levels of whole-cell lysates and amountsof specific protein during the treatment procedure. The activeforms of ERK1/2 (p42 and p44), p38, and JNK (p46 and p54)were undetectable in control cells and in cells treated with S.boulardii alone. The coincubation of bacteria with the yeast oncells did not modify the activation of the three groups ofMAPK. The preincubation of cells with the yeast followed byinfection in the presence of S. boulardii abolished the MAPKactivation. The preincubation of cells with the yeast followedby washes before bacterial infection partially inhibited theMAPK activation.All these results demonstrated that the yeast S. boulardiiprevents the MAPK activation induced by EHEC in T84 cells.FIG. 4.

IMMUN.DISCUSSIONTo date, T84 cells have been used as a model to study themechanism of EHEC infection for several reasons. These cellsresemble human colonic epithelial cells, the target cells forEHEC infection in vivo (15). These cells do not express de-tectable levels of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the receptorfor Stxs, and this model thus provides the opportunity to studyprimarily the effects related solely to the bacteria (24). More-over, it has been reported in the literature that EHEC inter-action (but not the interaction of toxin) with the apical cellsurface induces a decrease in TER (24). In this study, wedemonstrated that S. boulardii prevents the decrease of TER inEHEC-infected T84 cells. Additionally, when cells were pre-incubated overnight with yeast and then infected in the pres-ence of the yeast, S. boulardii decreased the IL-8 proinflam-matory secretion induced by EHEC in infected T84 cells.Altogether, these results demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts aprotective effect against EHEC infection and prompted us tounderstand this protective mechanism. We first hypothesizedthat S. boulardii could stop the bacterial growth. The growthassay showed that the presence of the yeast had no effect onEHEC viability. As EHEC is an enteroadherent bacterium andadhesion is an important step in this infection, our secondhypothesis was that S. boulardii inhibits EHEC adhesion.EHEC adhesion to T84 cells was reported to be strain depen-dent and related to the amount of piliation (31). EHEC pili arethought to be type I pili that are mannose sensitive. The cellwall of S. boulardii is rich in mannose and can thus compete forthe EHEC adhesion site on enterocytes. The data presented inthis study demonstrate that the number of adherent bacteriado not vary in the presence of the yeast. The fact that the yeastdid not modify the number of adherent bacteria can be ex-plained by the observation made by others (31) that mannosedecreases the adherence of some EHEC strains, has no effecton other strains, and appears to increase the adherence of stillothers.Since S. boulardii did not modify the number of adherentbacteria, we investigated the effect of the yeast on the next stepin EHEC infection, i.e., induction of host cell signal transduc-tion pathways. In a previous study, the protective effect of S.boulardii on EPEC infection was demonstrated and it wasreported that S. boulardii modulates the ERK1/2 signalingpathway induced by EPEC infection in T84 cells (5).Regulation of tight-junction permeability occurs at manysites within epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of the 20-kDaMLC on the serine or threonine residue is an important de-terminant of contractile tension in both smooth muscle andnonmuscle cells (9, 30, 32). In this study, we demonstrated thatEHEC infection induces time-dependent phosphorylation ofMLC. Time course experiments demonstrated that this processoccurs at 3 h of infection and precedes the drop in TER, whichbegins at 6 h of infection. MLC phosphorylation has previouslybeen reported after infection by EPEC (33). In that study, theauthors demonstrated a time-dependent process and corre-lated MLC phosphorylation with the decrease in TER. MLCmay be phosphorylated by either MLCK or PKC (23). Theinvolvement of MLCK and PKC in the EHEC-induced de-crease in the barrier function in T84 cells has previously beenreported (25). In that study, the authors demonstrated that theinhibition of MLCK by ML-9 (20 \ufffdM) only partially blockedthe EHEC-induced decrease in TER. The data presented inthis report show that ML-7, a more potent inhibitor of MLCK,abolishes MLC phosphorylation and the decrease of TER inEHEC-infected T84 cells. S. boulardii abolishes both theEHEC-induced drop of TER and concomitant MLC phos-phorylation, confirming the important role played by MLC inthe regulation of tight-junction permeability in EHEC infec-tion.In a recent study, by use of specific inhibitors of differentFIG. 6. Effect of S. boulardii on MAPK activation induced inEHEC-infected T84 cells. T84 cells were lysed at different times afterinfection. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by im-munoblotting with an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (A), an anti-phospho-p38(B), an anti-phospho-JNK (C), or an anti-ERK2 (D) antibody. Thecontrol lane corresponds to uninfected T84 cells. A 15-min stimulationby epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 nM was used as the positivecontrol.

BOULARDII 771signaling pathways, i.e., the MEK1/2 MAPK kinase inhibitorU0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the NF-\ufffdBinhibitor ALLN, a basal level of IL-8 production in infectedcells was restored (6). By this pharmacological approach, wedemonstrated that NF-\ufffdB and MAPK pathway activation isdirectly involved in IL-8 secretion by EHEC, i.e., in the potentproinflammatory response induced by EHEC infection.Data presented in this report show that the coincubation ofcells with S. boulardii and EHEC and preincubation of cellswith S. boulardii followed by washes before the infection pro-cedure had no effect on the NF-\ufffdB and MAPK pathway acti-vation induced by EHEC infection in T84 cells, whereas thepreincubation of cells with S. boulardii followed by EHECinfection in the presence of yeast inhibited NF-\ufffdB and MAPKpathway activation. Inactivation of these pathways is correlatedwith a S. boulardii-induced decrease of IL-8 production. In aprevious study, it was demonstrated that a 12-h yeast incuba-tion on T84 cells did not induce the cleavage of caspase 3,which allowed us to conclude that an overnight incubation withS. boulardii did not affect the T84 cell viability (5). We haveshown that the yeast was required to be viable and must bemaintained during infection to exert protection.These results prompted us to extrapolate several supposi-tions about S. boulardii\u2019s mechanisms of action. Previous stud-ies have demonstrated that S. boulardii secretes protease withactivities against Clostridium toxins (3). Such a protease mayalso affect EHEC virulence factors, for example, surface-lo-cated intimin. However, data reported in this study show thatS. boulardii cells do not modify the number of adherent bac-teria. For this reason, we studied cellular responses inducedafter intimate bacterial adhesion. We thus think that S. bou-lardii does not \u201cquench\u201d the virulence factor but rather modifyits expression. Transcriptional expression of the secreted pro-tein (EspA, EspB, and EspD) by environmental stimuli (i.e.,osmolarity) has been reported (1). Yeast can also act onEHEC protein synthesis involved in the type III secretionsystem, resulting in cellular rearrangement induction (12). Re-cently, the study of Kodama et al. (16) demonstrated thatEspB, a bacterial-secreted protein, recruits \ufffd-catenin at theEHEC adherence site by direct interaction and that the re-cruitment of \ufffd-catenin is essential for EHEC-induced A/Elesion formation. The complex E-cadherin-catenin not only isa cell-cell adhesion molecular complex and an actin-associatedcomplex but also contributes to a variety of functions, includingsignal transduction, inflammation, and immunological func-tions (13). This is the reason why the effect of S. boulardii onthe expression of EspB and other bacterial product will soonbe investigated by DNA array in our laboratory.The second hypothesis relates to the study of Neish et al.(21) regarding the cellular events leading to immune re-sponses. In that report, nonvirulent Salmonella strains whichinteracted directly with model human epithelia attenuated thesynthesis of the inflammatory effector molecules elicited bydiverse proinflammatory stimuli. This immunosuppressive ef-fect involves inhibition of the NF-\ufffdB pathway by blockade ofI\ufffdB-\ufffd degradation. Our study demonstrates that S. boulardiiexerts a preventive anti-inflammatory effect against pathogenicbacteria; this effect disappears when cells are washed beforeEHEC infection. Moreover, our findings reveal that the yeastcan interfere on different signaling pathways and, in particular,on the NF-\ufffdB pathway by blockade of both the phosphoryla-tion and degradation of I\ufffdB. S. boulardii seems to act at a leveldifferent from that at which the anti-inflammatory Salmonellastrain does. Neish et al. (21) suggest that prokaryotic determi-nants secreted by the anti-inflammatory Salmonella straincould be involved in the unresponsiveness of gastrointestinalmucosa to proinflammatory stimuli. This hypothesis could sug-gest that, in a normal situation, attenuation of acute inflam-matory responses by nonpathogenic organisms could contrib-ute to adaptation of the mucosal immune system, butdisruption of this equilibrium could contribute to the patho-genesis of enteric infections or inflammatory bowel disease.Moreover, it is relevant that nonpathogenic organisms are usednow as biotherapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease(17).In summary, we demonstrated that S. boulardii preserves thebarrier function of EHEC-infected cells and decreases theEHEC-induced IL-8 proinflammatory secretion. S. boulardiiacts via inhibition of the phosphorylation of MLC and inhibi-tion of the NF-\ufffdB and MAPK signaling pathways in T84-infected cells. These results open a new field for investigation,i.e., the study of the protective effect of S. boulardii in inflam-matory bowel disease.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by Laboratoires BIOCODEX, the Re\u0301gionProvence-Alpes Co\u0302te d\u2019Azur, the Conseil Ge\u0301ne\u0301ral des Alpes Mari-times, the Faculte\u0301 de Me\u0301decine de l\u2019Universite\u0301 de Nice-Sophia Anti-polis, and the Centre Hospitalier Re\u0301gional de Nice.We thank Naofumi Mukaida for assistance with EMSA.REFERENCES1.
