"Cyclin D1 cooperates with p21 to regulate TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and tumor local invasionRESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessCyclin D1 cooperates with p21 to regulateTGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migrationand tumor local invasionMeiou Dai1, Amal A Al-Odaini1,2, Nad\u00e8ge Fils-Aim\u00e91, Manuel A Villatoro1, Jimin Guo1, Ani Arakelian3,Shafaat A Rabbani3, Suhad Ali1 and Jean Jacques Lebrun1*AbstractIntroduction: Deregulation of the cell cycle machinery is often found in human cancers. Modulations in the cellcycle regulator function and expression result not only in proliferative advantages, but also lead to tumorprogression and invasiveness of the cancer. In particular, cyclin D1 and p21 are often over-expressed in humancancers, correlating with high tumor grade, poor prognosis and increased metastasis. This prompted us toinvestigate the role of the cyclin D1/p21 signaling axis downstream of transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) inbreast cancer progression.Methods: Cyclins mRNA and protein expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot intriple negative breast cancer cell lines. Co-localization and interaction between cyclin D1 and p21 were performedby immunocytochemistry and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Cell migration was assessed by wound healingand quantitative time-lapse imaging assays. In addition, the effects of cyclin D1 on cellular structure and actinorganization were examined by staining with F-actin marker phalloidin and mesenchymal intermediate filamentvimentin. Finally, a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess mammary tumor growth andlocal invasion.Results: We found TGFb to specifically up-regulate the expression of cyclin D1 in triple negative breast cancercells. Induction of cyclin D1 is also required for TGFb-mediated cell migration. Suppression of cyclin D1 expressionnot only resulted in a rounded and epithelial-like phenotype, but also prevented TGFb-induced vimentin andF-actin co-localization at the cell edge as well as invadopodia formation. Furthermore, TGFb promoted the nuclearco-localization and physical interaction between cyclin D1 and p21. The co-expression of cyclin D1 and p21proteins are required for the initial steps of tumor development, as double knockdown of these two moleculesprevented primary tumor formation in a Xenograft mouse model. Moreover, the in vivo studies indicated thatlocally advanced features of the invasive tumors, including skeletal muscle, mammary fat pad and lymphovascularinvasion, as well as ulcerated skin, were attenuated in the absence of cyclin D1 and p21.Conclusions: Thus, our findings highlight the cyclin D1/p21 signaling axis as a critical regulator of TGFb-mediatedtumor growth initiation and local tumor cell invasion, both in vitro and in vivo.Keywords: Cyclin D1, p21Cip1, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), Breast cancer, Migration, Invasion* Correspondence: jj.lebrun@mcgill.ca1Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill UniversityHealth Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, QC, CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleDai et al.

Todevelop metastasis in a distant organ, cancer cells mustinitially disseminate from the primary tumor and invadethrough the surrounding basement membrane andstroma into lymphatic or blood vessels, followed by sur-vival, extravasation and re-implantation at a secondarysite [2]. As cancer cell motility and invasiveness are cri-tical features in the initial development of metastasis,many molecules involved in these processes are becom-ing attractive therapeutic targets [3]. Understanding themolecular mechanisms that govern these early processesmay provide insightful strategies for the prevention ofcancer progression and metastasis.The transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) superfam-ily is comprised of many members, including activins,anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, bone morphogenetic proteins,growth and differentiation factors, inhibins and TGFbs [4].Among these family members, TGFb ligands and itsreceptors are widely expressed in all tissues and the regu-latory role played by these growth factors is of centralimportance to human cancer development and progres-sion. TGFb can be released from storage sites in the extra-cellular matix (ECM) and bone, as well as secreted in aparacrine and autocrine manner by platelet, myeloid,mesenchymal and cancer cells [5-7]. The increasingamount of TGFb1 is correlated with a high incidence ofdistant metastasis as TGFb acts on the tumor cells and thesurrounding stroma to promote epithelial to mesenchymaltransition (EMT), ECM degradation, cell migration, cellinvasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression and modifica-tion of the tumor microenvironment [8-11]. Intravital ima-ging of live tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated thatactive TGFb signaling is heterogeneously distributed in aminority of cancer cells within primary mammary tumors[12]. The activation of TGFb signaling promotes singletumor cell migration and metastatic spread into blood ves-sels and lymph nodes. However, not all cells with activeTGFb signaling are migratory, suggesting differentialTGFb signaling events and specific downstream targetsare required for this process.TGFb signal transduction begins with ligand bindingto the TGFb type II receptor, which recruits and acti-vates the type I receptor. The activated type I receptorthen phosphorylates intracellular mediators known asreceptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 andSmad3. This phosphorylation event allows for subse-quent heterotrimerization of two phosphorylated R-Smadsubunits with one common partner, Smad4 [13,14]. TheSmad heterotrimer then translocates to the nucleuswhere it can bind DNA, but with a very low affinity [15].In order to achieve high affinity binding, the Smadsassociate with various DNA binding partners [16]. It isthought that these partner proteins, which act as co-activators or co-repressors, are functionally expressed indifferent cell types, thus providing a basis for tissue andcell type-specific functions for TGFb ligands [17].Perturbations in the regulation of the cell cycle machin-ery often occur in human cancers, resulting in an imbal-ance between cell growth and cell death [18]. In addition,several reports have proposed that deregulation of cellcycle regulators results not only in proliferative advan-tages, but also in increased tumor progression and aggres-siveness traits [19]. Cell cycle progression is primarilymediated through interactions between the differentcyclins with their respective cyclin-dependent kinases(CDKs). Among the different cyclins, cyclin D1 and cyclinE are associated with the G1-S phase transition [20].Cyclin D1 interacts with CDK4 and 6, while cyclin E inter-acts more specifically with CDK2 [21-25]. The activity ofthe cyclin-CDK complexes is regulated by two classes ofsmall proteins referred to as cyclin-dependent kinasesinhibitors (CDKIs). The INK4 family, which includesp15INK4, p16INK4A, p18INK4C and p19INK4D, specifi-cally binds to CDK4 and 6, thereby preventing their asso-ciation with the D-type cyclins [26-29]. The KIP familyincludes p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21), p27KIP1 and p57KIP2[30-35]. While the KIP family members are usually asso-ciated with cyclin E-CDK and cyclin A-CDK complexes,many reports indicated that they also interact with cyclinD-CDK complexes [30,36-38].Many of these cell cycle regulators are primary targets ofTGFb signaling in human cancers [39-41]. Interestingly,some of these cell cycle regulators, in particular cyclin D1and p21, are often over-expressed in many human cancersand their levels are correlated with high tumor grade, poorprognosis, and increased metastasis in subsets of carcino-mas such as breast, prostate, cervical carcinomas andlymphomas [42,43]. We previously demonstrated that p21is a transcriptional co-regulator of Smad that mediatesTGFb-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion inmetastatic breast cancer cells [44]. This prompted us toexplore the roles of other cell cycle regulators in promotingtumor progression in breast cancer, aside from their well-established functions in cell cycle regulation. Thus, weinvestigated the effects of cyclins, in particular cyclinD1, downstream of TGFb-mediated tumor progression.Indeed, several studies have supported the notion thatthe oncogenic effects of cyclin D1 may not be simply dueto enhanced tumor cell growth or proliferation. Theseinclude reports showing a lack of correlation between cellproliferation and cyclin D1 expression in several largecohorts of 779 breast cancer patients [45,46] and the factthat elevated cyclin D1 expression is associated with a highincidence of metastasis and poor survival outcome [47,48],suggesting that cyclin D1 may play a role in promotinginvasiveness of established tumors.Dai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49Page 2 of 14In this study, we found that TGFb induced mRNA andprotein expression of cyclin D1 in breast cancer cells witha highly migratory phenotype. Moreover, we found TGFbto induce complex formation and nuclear co-localizationof cyclin D1 and p21, indicating that these two proteinsmay cooperate to mediate TGFb functions in aggressivehuman breast cancer cells. Furthermore, using gene silen-cing approaches, our results indicate that TGFb-mediatedcyclin D1 expression is a prerequisite for TGFb-inducedbreast cancer cell migration. Orthotopic injection of cyclinD1/p21 null human breast cancer cells in nude mice con-siderably reduced mammary tumor growth in vivo, com-pared to animals injected with parental tumor cells.Moreover, we found that following fat pad transplantation,parental breast cancer cells invaded into the surroundingmammary tissues, while these effects were blocked whencyclin D1 and p21 gene expression were silenced. Collec-tively, these data indicate that TGFb-mediated cyclin D1and p21 gene expression leads to increased breast cancermigration and invasion in vitro and that blocking expres-sion of these two cell cycle regulators in aggressive humanbreast tumors significantly reduced both tumor formationand local tumor invasion into the surrounding tissuesin vivo.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (hereafterreferred to as MDA) and SCP2 (provided by Dr. JoanMassagu\u00e9) were cultured in DMEM containing 10%fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine.SUM149PT, SUM159PT and SUM229PE (provided byDr. Stephen P. Ethier) were plated in F-12 HAM\u2019S nutri-ent mixture (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT,USA) containing 5% FBS, 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1 \u00b5g/ml hydrocorti-sone (Sigma). SUM1315MO2 were cultured in F-12HAM\u2019S nutrient mixture (HyClone) containing 5% FBS,5 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growthfactor (EGF) (Sigma). All cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0Cin 5% CO2. Before stimulation with 5 ng/ml TGFb1(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), cells were serum-starved overnight. For cell transfection, flag-tagged p21cDNA (Addgene plasmid 16240), HA-tagged cyclin D1cDNA (Addgene plasmid 11181), scrambled and cyclinD1 siRNAs (Sigma) were transfected using Lipofecta-mine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), accordingto the manufacturers\u2019 protocols.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationProtein extraction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyro-phosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mMphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydro-chloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A)were freshly prepared and kept at 4\u00b0C before cell lysis.After cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the concentration of total protein wasquantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scienti-fic, Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates were boiled with 6\u00d7sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer forfive minutes and subjected to immunoblot using mouseanti-p21 and rabbit anti-cyclin D1 antibodies (1:1,000 dilu-tion, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).p21 and cyclin D1 were immunoprecipitated overnight at4\u00b0C using their respective antibodies and followed by theaddition of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE HealthcareBio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for one hour at 4\u00b0C.The immunocomplexes were washed four times with coldlysis buffer and then subjected to Western blot.Real-Time PCRTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNAand reverse transcription of total RNA was carried outusing M-MLV reverse transcriptase and random primers(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00d2 Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,USA) was used for amplification of the cyclin D1 mRNAin a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI LabEquipment, Montreal Biotech Inc., Kirkland, QC, Canada).The conditions for PCR were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 59\u00b0C for 20 s). The primersequences were as follows: cyclin D1 forward primer,AGCTGTGCATCTACACCGAC; reverse primer, ACTC-CAGCAGGGCTTCGATCTG; GAPDH forward primer,GCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCCT; reverse primer,TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGAT.Kinetic cell migration assayCell migration was performed as previously described [44].Briefly, 50,000 cells per well were cultured in Essen Image-Lock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI,USA). The confluent cell layers were scratched to generatea wound using the Essen Wound maker. Cells were thentreated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml ofTGFb1. The images/videos of the wound were automati-cally taken at the exact same location using the IncuCy-te\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Wound width, woundconfluence or relative wound density were automaticallymeasured by the IncuCyte software.Transwell cell migration assayTransfected cell suspensions (40,000 cells/well) wereseeded in 24-well Cell Culture Inserts (8-\u00b5m pore size;BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). After 24hours incubation, the cells that migrated to the bottomof the membrane were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde forDai et al.

The fluorescence intensityof migrated cells was measured at 700 nm in a near-infrared fluorescence imager (Odyssey CLX, LI-CORBiosciences - Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE, USA) usingthe Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences -Biotechnology).Immunofluorescence microscopyFor the invadopodia formation assay, cells were grownon top of eight-well chamber slides coated with 100 \u00b5lgrowth factor-reduced Matrigel. After TGFb treatmentfor 24 hours, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehydefor 10 minutes, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for3 minutes, and blocked for 1 hour in 2% bovine serumalbumin (BSA). Fixed cells were incubated with primaryantibodies against p21, cyclin D1, F-actin and vimentinfor one hour and followed by the secondary antibodiesAlexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor\u00ae488 goat anti-rabbit (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) forone hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen).Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberko-chen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using the 63\u00d7objective.Mammary fat pad injection of nude miceThe animal study and SCP2 cells used in the mice modelwere approved by the McGill ethics committee (UniversityAnimal Care Committee, UACC) and all the experimentalanimal protocols were in accordance with the McGill Uni-versity Animal Care. Four- to six-week old female Balb/cnude mice (Charles River Laboratories International,Wilmington, MA, USA) were used as a model for asses-sing mammary tumor formation and local invasion.An anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine(5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) was injected intra-muscularly into mice (six per group). Fifty thousand par-ental SCP2 cells or p21 and cyclin D1 double knockdownSCP2 cells in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) were injectedinto the mice mammary fat pads using a 30-gauge needle.Tumor growth and size were measured using a caliper. Ateight weeks post-injection, mice were sacrificed and mam-mary tumors with surrounding skin and tissues were fixedin 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections ofmammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.(VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin andeosin to assess local advanced features, including skeletalmuscle, mammary fat pad, and lymphovascular invasion aswell as skin ulceration. Images of the tumors were photo-graphed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and p21/cyclin D1-depleted SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramus-cularly into the left tibia of two group mice (six pergroup). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor bur-den. Digital radiography of hind limbs of all animals wasused to monitor the development of skeletal lesions atfour, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron X-ray Corp.). On week8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken.Statistical analysesThe difference between groups was analyzed using Stu-dent\u2019s t-test, and *P <0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant.ResultsTGFb induces cyclin D1 expression in highly migratorybreast cancer cellsWe have previously shown that TGFb\u2019s pro-migratory andinvasive effects are mediated through the induction of p21in highly migratory triple negative breast cancer cells [44].Due to the fact that p21 is a universal regulator of cyclin/CDKs, this prompted us to investigate whether additionalcell cycle regulators downstream of TGFb are involved inthis process. Moreover, because multiple studies have sug-gested that the oncogenic effects of cyclins may not besimply due to enhanced tumor cell growth or proliferationbut may also involve tumor promoting functions [45-48],we examined the effect of TGFb on protein expressionlevels of cyclins A, B1, D1 and D2 in the human aggressivebreast cancer cell lines MDA and its metastatic sub-progeny SCP2 [49]. As shown in Figure 1A, we found thatTGFb significantly increased cyclin D1 protein expressionin a time-dependent fashion. The effect of TGFb on cyclinD1 expression was specific, as protein levels of G1 and Sphase regulators cyclin D2 and A remained unchanged inresponse to TGFb stimulation. The M phase cyclin B1 wasbarely detectable. As a positive control, we measured theexpression of p21, which we have previously shown to bepotently induced by TGFb in MDA cells [44]. TGFbinduced the expression of p21 in a similar temporalexpression pattern as cyclin D1 in these breast cancercells. To assess whether TGFb regulates cyclin D1 at thetranscriptional level, we measured mRNA levels of cyclinD1 by quantitative PCR in SCP2 cells stimulated withTGFb for 2, 6 and 24 hours. Induction of cyclin D1mRNA by TGFb was already detectable at 2 hours andwas sustained for up to 24 hours (Figure 1B). These resultshighlight cyclin D1 as a novel TGFb downstream targetgene in human breast cancer cells.To determine whether there was an association betweenTGFb induction of cyclin D1 and TGFb\u2019s pro-migratoryeffect, we measured the mRNA level of cyclin D1 in aDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49Page 4 of 14panel of triple negative breast cancer cell lines which areeither insensitive (SUM1315) or responsive (SUM149 andSUM159) to TGFb-mediated cell migration and invasion[44]. Interestingly, TGFb potently and persistently up-regu-lated cyclin D1 mRNA in the highly migratory cell linesSUM149 and SUM159, but not in the TGFb-insensitiveSUM1315 cell line (Figure 1C). Together, these resultsindicate that TGFb-induced cyclin D1 expression corre-lates with TGFb-induced p21 gene expression and cellmigration, thus, suggesting that cyclin D1 may be asso-ciated with p21 and participate in TGFb tumor-promotingfunctions in breast cancer cells.TGFb promotes cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation andco-localization with p21The intracellular localization of cyclin D1 is importantfor its function and is, therefore, tightly regulated [50].Constitutive accumulation of cyclin D1 in the nucleushas been shown to promote tumor transformation [51].To determine whether TGFb regulates cyclin D1 nuclearlocalization, we assessed the localization of cyclin D1 inMDA and SCP2 cells treated with or without TGFb for24 hours by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.Cyclin D1 was predominantly found in the cytosol inunstimulated cells, whereas it appeared to be primarilyretained within the nucleus after treatment with TGFb(Figure 2A).We have previously shown that TGFb induces proteinexpression and nuclear localization of p21 in triple nega-tive breast cancer cells [44]. The concurrent TGFb effecton p21 and cyclin D1 prompted us to determine whetherthese molecules co-localize within the nucleus in responseto TGFb. As shown in Figure 2B, TGFb facilitates nuclearco-localization of cyclin D1 and p21 in MDA cells. Thesimultaneous induction and co-localization in the nucleusof cyclin D1 and p21 by TGFb suggested that they may bephysically associated with each other. To address this, weperformed co-immunoprecipitation of p21 and cyclin D1in MDA and SCP2 cells treated with or without TGFb for6 or 24 hours.

Moreover, the induction ofcomplex formation between endogenous cyclin D1 andp21 was also observed in both SUM149 and SUM159 cells(Figure 2D, middle and right panels). Collectively, theseresults indicated that TGFb stimulates the formation of acomplex between cyclin D1 and p21 in triple negativebasal-like breast cancer cells.Cyclin D1 is required for TGFb-mediated cell migrationGiven that TGFb enhanced cyclin D1 and p21 expressionand complex formation in these human metastatic breastcancer cells, we investigated whether the TGFb pro-migratory effect is mediated through cyclin D1. Toaddress this, SCP2 cells were transfected with scrambled(Scr) siRNA or cyclin D1 siRNA. Cell migration inresponse to TGFb was assessed by the scratch/woundhealing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imagingfor up to 24 hours. As shown in Figure 3A, TGFb-induced cyclin D1 protein expression in the SCP2 cellstransfected with Scr siRNA was blocked in cells trans-fected with cyclin D1 siRNA. As shown in Figure 3B, C,while TGFb stimulated rapid wound closure in SCP2cells transfected with the Scr siRNA, this effect wasdelayed in SCP2 cells depleted of cyclin D1. TGFb-induced wound closure was not affected by the mitoticinhibitor mitomycin C, suggesting that the effect ofTGFb on cell migration was independent of cell prolifera-tion (Figure 3D). We further assessed the role of cyclinD1 downstream of TGFb-mediated cell migration, usinga Transwell migration assay. As shown in Figure 3E, F,knocking down cyclin D1 inhibited the TGFb pro-migratory effects, consistent with what observed with thewound healing assay (Figure 3B, C).To then address whether cyclin D1 and p21 have anysynergistic effect, p21 and cyclin D1 cDNAs were over-expressed alone or in combination and the TGFb effecton cell migration was examined using both the woundhealing and Transwell migration assays. As shown inFigure 3G, overexpression of cyclin D1 or p21 alone hadlittle or no potentiation effect on TGFb-induced cellmigration. However, overexpression of both proteinsclearly increased/potentiated the TGFb effect, suggestingthat these two proteins synergize their effect downstreamof TGFb. This is consistent with our main finding andconclusion, showing that the two proteins cooperate toregulate TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration andtumor local invasion. Together, these results demonstratethat cyclin D1 is required for TGFb-mediated migrationin breast cancer cells.Cyclin D1 is a downstream mediator in TGFb-regulatedactin reorganization and invadopodia formationCyclin D1 has previously been reported to regulate cellu-lar migration in primary bone macrophages, mouseembryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and breast cancer cells[52-54]. For instance, cyclin D1-deficient MEFs display amore spread phenotype, and an increased cell adhesionand actin stress fiber formation through inhibition ofthrombospondin 1 and ROCK signaling [53]. Therefore,we examined whether cyclin D1 effects on cellular struc-ture and actin organization contribute to TGFb-mediatedcancer cell migration. To this end, SCP2 cells transfectedwith either Scr or cyclin D1 siRNAs were stimulated withTGFb and the dynamics of actin organization wereassessed by staining with the fluorescently labeled F-actinmarker phalloidin and mesenchymal intermediate fila-ment vimentin. As shown in Figure 4A, vimentin fila-ments co-localized with F-actin at the leading edge ofaggressive SCP2 cells transfected with Scr siRNA, whichdisplayed an elongated phenotype in response to TGFb.Interestingly, cyclin D1-deficient cells were rounded andexhibited more epithelial-like phenotype. Furthermore,suppression of cyclin D1 expression not only preventedthe elongation of vimentin filaments, but also the co-localization with F-actin at the cell edge.Vimentin is required for the elongation of invadopodiasubcellular structures, which are three-dimensionalactin-rich protrusions [55]. Invadopodia are selectivelyfound in invasive cancer cells and are important for thedegradation of the ECM [56]. As cyclin D1 affects vimen-tin distribution, we investigated whether cyclin D1 couldregulate invadopodia formation. SCP2 cells transfectedwith either Scr or cyclin D1 siRNAs were seeded on topof growth factor-reduced Matrigel and treated with orwithout TGFb. Whereas Scr-transfected SCP2 cells sti-mulated with TGFb showed increased F-actin-bundledprotrusion and invaded into the Matrigel, this phenotypewas completely abolished by knocking down cyclin D1expression (Figure 4B). All together, these results definednovel functions for cyclin D1 as a TGFb downstream tar-get that is required for this growth factor to mediatevimentin elongation, induction of a migratory morpholo-gical phenotype, and the formation of invasive subcellularstructures in metastatic breast cancer cells.Depletion of cyclin D1 and p21 prevents mammary tumorgrowth and local invasionOverexpression of p21 and cyclin D1 is correlated withpoor prognosis and aggressiveness in breast cancer. Toaddress the importance of p21 and cyclin D1 on breastcancer development in vivo, we injected either SCP2 con-trol or double p21 and cyclin D1 knockdown cells intothe mammary fat pads of female Balb/c nude mice tomonitor primary tumor growth and local invasiveness.Dai et al.

As depletion of p21 alonedid not affect tumor formation in a Xenograft transplan-tation in vivo model [55], it is likely that the observedphenotype on tumor formation in the double knockdownis mediated by cyclin D1. This is in agreement withprevious studies showing that depletion of cyclin D1 pre-vented tumor development in oncogenic HER2 overex-pressing transgenic mice [57-59]. Importantly, three outof six mice in the control group had tumors ulceratingthrough the overlaying skin, while all the mice in thedouble knockdown group had intact skin.

All tumors were taken with theoverlaying skin and surrounding tissues and subjected tohematoxylin and eosin staining. As shown in Figure 5B,the deep tumor margins in the control group were lessdistinct, invading nearby structures, including skeletalmuscles and the mammary fat pad, and showed frequentlymphovascular invasion. However, the tumor margins inthe knockdown group were well encapsulated with anon-invasive nature. In addition, we performed immuno-histochemistry on primary mammary tumor derivedfrom animals injected with parental and p21/cyclin D1-depleted SCP2 cells. We assessed the expression of theTGFb-regulated gene PTGS2, which we have previouslyshown to be involved in mediating the TGFb effect oncell migration and invasion [44]. As shown in Figure 5C,using tumors from four different mice in each group, wefound expression of PTGS2 to be clearly higher in paren-tal tumors compared to p21/cyclin D1-depleted tumors,further confirming that the p21/cyclin D1-depletedtumors displayed less invasive features.To investigate the role of p21 and cyclin D1 on thedevelopment of bone osteolytic lesions, parental and dou-ble knockdown SCP2 cells were injected intramuscularlyinto the left tibia of two groups of nude mice. As shown inFigure 5D, following X-ray examination of the bones, bothgroup of mice developed secondary tumors that causedsevere osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21/cyclinD1 do not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Col-lectively, these results indicate that while p21 and cyclinD1 are required for breast cancer cells to acquire an inva-sive phenotype, their effects are primarily occurring at theearlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction oflocal cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tis-sues. This is also consistent with previous work, showingthat depletion of p21 alone did not affect the developmentof bone osteolytic lesions [44].DiscussionCyclin D1 is a well-characterized oncogene that is fre-quently overexpressed in human breast, lung, colon, pros-tate and hematopoietic carcinomas [60-62]. This is aunique feature among the three closely related D type G1cyclins (D1, D2 and D3), as amplification of cyclin D2 andD3 copy-number is rarely observed in human cancer. Infact, methylation of cyclin D2 resulting in loss of itsexpression has been reported in breast, pancreatic andprostate cancer [63-65]. In addition to the associationbetween cyclin D1 expression and human cancer, overex-pression of cyclin D1 is tumorigenic, as supported by evi-dence that MMTV-driven cyclin D1 is sufficient formammary hyperplasia and carcinoma development intransgenic mice [66]. Furthermore, cyclin D1 is requiredfor many oncogenes, such as HER2 or Ras, to inducemammary tumor growth in mice [57-59]. The function ofcyclin D1 in mammary oncogenesis in mice is mediatedthrough the activation of its regulatory partner CDK4, asmice lacking CDK4 or expressing the CDK4/CDK6-speci-fic inhibitor INK4A are resistant to HER2-induced mam-mary tumor formation [58,67-69]. While these studiesaddressed the importance of cyclin D1 on breast tumorinitiation, its contribution to the development and pro-gression of established tumors remains unclear.Several studies support the notion that the oncogeniceffects of cyclin D1 may not be simply due to enhancedtumor cell growth or proliferation. For instance, cyclin D1expression did not correlate with Ki67 expression in acohort of 779 breast cancer patients [45]. In another studyof 1,740 breast cancer patients, cyclin D1 expression wasnot tightly associated with proliferative genes that areregulated by the inactivation of CDK4 substrate RB [46].In addition, high expression of cyclin D1 is associated withhigh incidence of metastasis and poor survival outcome[47,48]. Therefore, cyclin D1 is potentially required forcontinual development and progression of establishedtumors.In this study, we investigated the function of cyclin D1on breast tumor progression induced by TGFb, a potenttumor-promoting factor, in metastatic breast cancer celllines. Our results showed that the effect of TGFb on cyclinD1 expression was specific, as protein levels of othercyclins in G1, S and M phase are unresponsive to TGFbstimulation. Furthermore, using a panel of tumorigenic tri-ple negative breast cancer cell lines, which exhibit differen-tial responses to TGFb in terms of cellular migration, wefound cyclin D1 expression to correlate with p21 expres-sion and to be required for TGFb-induced cell migration.Furthermore, up-regulation of the cyclin D1 gene byTGFb is more potent and persistent in highly migratorycell lines compared with less motile cells. This is consis-tent with a previous study using intravital imaging of livetumor-bearing nude mice, showing that although TGFbsignaling promotes single tumor cell migration and meta-static spread into blood vessels and lymph nodes, not allcells with active TGFb signaling are migratory [12]. Ourresults suggest that cyclin D1 is a specific downstream tar-get for TGFb-mediated cell migration.Subcellular localization and stabilization of cyclin D1play an important role in human cancers [70]. We showeda TGFb-induced nuclear localization of cyclin D1 in thesemetastatic breast cancer cell lines. It has been demon-strated that oncogenic actions of cyclin D1 are predomi-nantly nuclear in many cancers, as carcinogenic mutationsand deletions often occur at the T286 site, which controlscyclin D1 protein turnover and nuclear export [71,72].Mutated cyclin D1 with constitutive nuclear localizationand impaired degradation not only enhanced cyclin D1transformation efficiency in vitro, but also promotedtumor formation in vivo [73]. Our study further revealedDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49Page 11 of 14that TGFb-induced nuclear cyclin D1 promotes cellmigration by altering cell morphology and the formationof invasive subcellular structures in metastatic breast can-cer cells.Cyclin D1 has been recognized as a multifunctional pro-tein, which regulates angiogenesis, lipogenesis, mitochon-drial function and cell migration [53,54,74-78]. A recentstudy identified that more than 100 cyclin D1-interactingproteins are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, tran-scription, DNA repair, RNA metabolism, protein foldingand cell structure [79], suggesting that these interactorsmight influence various biological functions of cyclin D1.It has been shown that p21 interacts with cyclin D1 topromote nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 [80]. In addi-tion, cyclin D1 associates with p21 to facilitate DNArepair, and this function of cyclin D1 is independent ofCDK4 activation [81,82]. We demonstrated that in thecontext of TGFb signaling, cyclin D1 associates with p21in metastatic breast cancer cells. Furthermore, depletion ofcyclin D1 and p21 prevented mammary tumor formationand subsequent local invasion into surrounding tissues.Our previous study showed that p21 is required forTGFb-mediated cell migration and invasion; therefore,these results not only highlight cyclin D1 as a novel TGFbdownstream target, but also indicate that cyclin D1 coop-erates with p21 to mediate the effect of TGFb on breastcancer progression.ConclusionsIn this study, we showed that TGFb significantly inducedcyclin D1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells.TGFb-induced cyclin D1 and p21 proteins remain mostlyco-localized in the nucleus and physically interact witheach other. Importantly, we found that up-regulated p21and cyclin D1 play an important role in TGFb regulationof cellular migration and invasion by actin remodeling.These results suggest that cyclin D1 and p21 may coop-erate with each other to mediate the tumor-promotingeffects of TGFb in aggressive breast cancer cells.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; CDKs: cyclin-dependent kinases; CDKIs: cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors; DMEM: Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium;DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; EGF: epidermal growthfactor; EMT: epithelial to mesenchymal transition; FBS: fetal bovine serum;MEF: mouse embryo fibroblast; p21: p21CIP1/WAF1; R-Smads: receptor-regulated Smads; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; TGF\u03b2: transforming growthfactor betaCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors\u2019 contributionsMD and JJL were involved in designing all experiments, and analyzing andinterpreting data.
