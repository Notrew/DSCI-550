The mechanism by which quiescent TECs re-obtain a potential to regenerate remains unknown. In this study,we observed a transient re-expression of embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) in adult rat TECs in vivo during ischemia-reperfusion induced AKI and most Pax2 positive TECs co-expressed kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker.The re-expression of Pax2 was accompanied by increased levels of intrarenal Angiotensin II, which is a crucial injury factor ofAKI. Furthermore, we also found a temporary re-expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells under the stimulation of Angiotensin II.This stimulatory effect could be blocked by PD123319 (Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibitor) and AG490 (JanusKinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor). As Pax2 is essential for the phenotypic conversion from mesenchymal stem cells to TECs duringkidney development, we proposed that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be an indicator of \u2018\u2018atavistic\u2019\u2019transition which mimics but reverses the processes of development of TECs. This could be proved by that a progenitormarker, CD24, was also found to be transiently expressed shortly after the expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulatedwith Angiotensin II. The expression of CD24 was also suppressed by PD123319 and AG490. Moreover, knockdown of Pax2by RNA interference could significantly reduce the expression of CD24 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotension II.Those findings suggest that mature TECs can trans-differentiate into progenitor-like cells by \u2018\u2018atavistic transition\u2019\u2019, which mayparticipate in the recovery of tissue structure and Pax2 may play a pivotal role in this process. That might have importantimplications for further understanding of tubular regeneration after injury.Citation: Jiang Y, Jiang T, Ouyang J, Zhou Q, Liang Y, et al.

The recovery of renal function after AKI depends on therecovery of renal tubular epithelium[1], but the mechanism oftubular epithelial reconstruction remains unclear. It has beenproposed that surviving tubular epithelial cells (TECs) re-enter cellcycle and replace damaged TECs by proliferating, but themechanism by which quiescent TECs regain the potential toregenerate is still unknown. Meanwhile, this model has beenchallenged by recent studies which suggest a role for stem/progenitor cells in kidney repair. Nevertheless, the origin of thesestem/progenitor cells remains unclear [2,3,4,5].Our previous study demonstrated that TECs could be inducedto temporarily re-express embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2)during chronic kidney injury, which indicated that TECs couldtransform into an immature cell phenotype and participate inkidney repair during chronic kidney injury [6]. We then proposedthat a similar \"atavistic\" phenotype transition might also occurduring AKI [7]. This notion is supported by the finding that amesenchymal cell marker, vimentin, could be expressed in tubularepithelium during the recovery stage of AKI [8].The transition of TECs from one phenotype to another is not anew concept. During the embryonic stage of the kidney, themesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) which mesenchymalstem cells (MSCs) are converted into a polarized tubular epithelialphenotype is a pivotal event for the differentiation of TECs. Pax2is expressed during MET and essential for this phenotypetransition [9]. During chronic kidney injury, epithelial tomesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proven to occur inmature TECs. Pax2 is also expressed during EMT and essentialfor this phenotype transition [6]. Those findings suggest that theexpression of Pax2 controls the phenotype transition betweenstem/progenitor cells and epithelial cells. Therefore, we believethat the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be a sign ofcell atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic andcellular processes of tubular development. This atavistic transitionallows mature TECs to gain a characteristic of stem/progenitor-PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093563&domain=pdflike cells, which could re-differentiate into TECs that restore tissuestructure.In this study, we demonstrated that Pax2 was re-expressed inTECs during AKI in vivo, and we also found that Pax2 and astem/progenitor cell marker, CD24, were temporarily re-expressed in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II (AngII) in vitro. Both AT2R/JAK2 inhibitor and Pax2 iRNA couldblock the re-expression of Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cellsinduced by Ang II. These findings led us to propose that matureTECs can undergo an atavistic transition to convert into stem/progenitor-like cells and participate in renal repair during AKI.Pax2 may play a central role in this process.ResultsThe construction of AKI animal modelAKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in Wistarrats as IRI is the most common cause of AKI [1]. The heart rateand glucose levels did not statistically differ before, during, or afteroperation both in experimental groups (IRI groups) and controlgroups (sham operation groups) (data not shown). The totalelimination rate (due to death in all cases) was 5/96 (3/48 for IRIgroups and 2/48 for sham operation groups).The induction of renal damage by IRI was verified bybiochemical and histological measurements. Both blood ureani-trogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) increased significantly during theearly stage of AKI in IRI groups (24 to 48 hours (h) afteroperation). No alteration of BUN and Cr levels was observed insham operation groups (figure 1).Kidney sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showedremarkable changes consistent with AKI in IRI groups 24 h afterIRI, such as disrupted brush borders and flattened epithelia.Epithelial cell proliferation changes were observed 72 h after IRI(figure 2A). Pathology scores of kidney showed significant increasesafter IRI in experimental groups, indicating remarkable renaltissue damages were induced by IRI (figure 2B). No significantchanges were observed in animals of sham operation groups. Boththe biochemical and histological results showed that the IRI-induced AKI rat model was successfully established.Re-expression of Pax2 in proximal tubular epitheliumduring recovery stage of AKIThe re-expression of Pax2 in the tubular epithelium during AKIwas verified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) detec-tions. A remarkable raise of Pax2 mRNA and protein levels wasobserved in the renal cortex of animals in IRI groups. Theexpression levels of Pax2 increased at 24 h, maximized at 72 hand decreased at 96 h after IRI. No apparent expression of Pax2could be observed in sham operated animals (figure 3). The IHCdetection showed that Pax2 could not be detected in proximalTECs in normal kidney, while 24-72 h after IRI, Pax2 wasexpressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs (figure 4). No changes ofPax2 expression pattern was observed in sham operation groups.Pax2 re-expression occurs primarily in injured epitheliacellsTo elucidate the relationship between Pax2 expression andtubular injury, we co-stained for Pax2 and kidney injurymolecular-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker, We found that77.0612.5% of Pax2-positive cells co-expressed KIM-1 (figure 5).This result indicates that most if not all Pax2 re-expression occurin injured TECs during AKI.Pax2 expression was accompanied by intrarenal Ang IIincreases in vivoThe intrarenal Ang II concentration significantly increased afteroperation and maintained a high level in IRI groups. The levels ofintrarenal Ang II also slightly increased in sham operation groupsand gradually decreased to a lower level thereafter (figure 6).Ang II stimulated Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells viaAT2R and JAK2In vivo studies proved that the level of intrarenal Ang IIincreased during AKI and was accompanied by Pax2 re-expression. Therefore, we used Ang II to stimulate NRK-52Ecells to verify that mature TECs have the ability of Pax2 re-expression. Pax2 was observed to be transiently expressed inNRK-52E cells in response to Ang II stimulation. Ang IIstimulated Pax2 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner(figure 7A, figure 7B). The immunofluorescence analyses showedthat Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of NRK-52E cells,which isconsistent with the fact that Pax2 is a nuclear transcription factor(figure 7C).To investigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang IIinduced Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells, we pre-incubatedFigure 1. BUN (A) and Cr (B) results. In sham operation groups,there was no alteration of BUN and Cr levels after operation. In IRIgroups, BUN and Cr levels increased significantly during the early stageof AKI (24 to 48 h after operation)(N = 6 for each time point, *P,0.05, IRIcompared with sham), indicating impaired kidney function in IRI groups24 to 48 h after operation. 72 h after operation, BUN and Cr levels in IRIgroups decreased significantly and showed no difference with shamoperation groups, indicating the recovery of renal function in IRI groups72 h after operation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g001Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with PD123319(AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor). Results withwestern blot and RT-PCR showed that both PD123319 andAG490 could block the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2expression in NRK-52E cells (figure 8), suggesting that thestimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2 expression in TECs ismediated by AT2R and JAK2 pathways.These data indicate that mature TECs can re-express embry-onic gene Pax2 in response to stimulation of injury factors like AngII and the re-expression of Pax2 might be a sign of cell atavistictransition.Pax2 expression was accompanied by CD24 expression inNRK-52E cells induced by Ang IITo further confirm that mature TECs have the ability of cellatavistic transition in response to stimulation of injury factors likeAng II, we measured the expression of a stem/progenitor cellmarker, CD24[10], in NRK-52E cells stimulated by Ang II. Weobserved a transient expression of CD24 shortly after theexpression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells in response to Ang IIstimulation. The immunofluorescence analyses showed that CD24was expressed at the surface of NRK-52E cells, which consistentwith the fact that CD24 is a cell membrane protein (figure 9).We also used PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2inhibitor) to examine whether the mechanisms that mediate Ang IIinduced CD24 expression are similar with that mediate Ang IIinduced Pax2 expression. Western blot and RT-PCR showed thatboth PD123319 and AG490 could inhibit Ang II induced CD24expression (figure 10). These data suggest that Ang II stimulatesthe atavistic transition of TECs via the AT2R and JAK2 pathways.Knockdown of Pax2 suppressed Ang II induced CD24expression in NRK-52E cellsThe experiments above demonstrated that both Pax2 andCD24 could be stimulated in mature TECs by Ang II via the samesignal pathways. Therefore, we used shRNA (pshRNA-Pax2-983)-mediated RNA interference of Pax2 to further determine therelationship between Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells inducedby Ang II.Transfection of NRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in asignificant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression levels asshown by western blot and RT-PCR. The repression rate was74.368.2% as judged by western blot. Transfection with emptilyplasmid vector failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2shRNA was specific in that it failed to knock down the expressionof unrelated protein b-actin (figure 11).Western blot and RT-PCR showed that the knockdown of Pax2significantly suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells (figure 12). These data suggest that Pax2 regulates theexpression of CD24 in mature TECs induced by Ang II. Thatmight indicate a central role of Pax2 in the cell atavistic transitionprocess of TECs.DiscussionPax2 is a transcription control factor which plays a crucialregulatory role during kidney development. During fetal life, Pax2is essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET),which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are converted into tubularepithelial phenotype[9]. Pax2 is not originally expressed in MSCs,but is only induced when MSCs meet the ureteric bud. Pax-2controls the process of MET by initiating a genetic cascade thatincludes WT1, Wnt4, Six2 and c-Ret to suppress the expression ofmesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, and promote epithelialmarkers, such as E-cadherin and cytokeratin [11,12,13]. Pax2 isdown-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete, showing atransient expression pattern [14].Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinicalproblem. The recovery of renal tubular epithelium after AKI iscritical for the recovery of renal structure and function. It is stillnot clear how quiescent TECs regain the potential to regenerateand whether a group of specialized stem/progenitor cells play arole during kidney repair [2,3,4]. Our previous study demonstrat-ed that TECs could be induced to temporarily re-express Pax2during chronic kidney injury [6], which suggested that matureTECs could transform into an immature cell phenotype duringchronic kidney injury. We then proposed that a similar atavistictransition might also occur during AKI.In this study, we observed a transient Pax2 re-expression inproximal tubular epithelium of IRI-induced AKI animals. Pax2Figure 2. Pathology results of renal cortex sections. IRI groupsshowed remarkable changes on tubular structures detected by HEstaining (A). Disrupted brush borders and flattened epithelia wereobserved at 24 h after IRI, which indicated apparent tubular damage.Epithelial cell proliferation changes were observed at 72 h after IRI.Tissue structures recovery were observed at 120 h after IRI (B). Thepathology scores of the IRI groups significantly increased 24 h after IRI,and were sustained higher than sham operation groups 120 h afteroperation (*P,0.05, IRI compared with sham).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g002Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563was expressed during the recovery stage of AKI. Most Pax2positive epithelial cells co-expressed a tubular injury marker, KIM-1, indicating that Pax2 was primarily expressed in injured TECs.These data suggest that Pax2 re-expression might have afunctional link with kidney epithelium injury and repair.It remains to be shown which factors induce the transient re-expression of Pax2 in TECs after IRI. Intrarenal Angiotensin II(Ang II) is one of the most important injury factors in IRI-inducedAKI [15,16]. We verified a dramatic increase of intrarenal Ang IIafter IRI by RIA. Ang II plays an important role during tubulardevelopment and up-regulates Pax2 expression in fetal kidneyepithelial cells [17,18]. Thus, we hypothesized that Ang II mightalso stimulate the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs. We thenused Ang II to simulate NRK-52E cells in vitro and verified thatAng II could stimulate Pax2 expression in mature TECs in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The expression of Pax2 in NRK-52Es also showed a transient pattern, which is consistent with thetransient expression feature during tubular development.During embryonic stage, the stimulatory effect of Ang II onPax2 is mediated by AT2R. Pax2 and AT2R share a similartransient expression pattern during renal development, both ofthem are down-regulated in TECs when nephrogenesis iscompleted [17,19,20]. Interestingly, AT2R is also up-regulatedin TECs after kidney injury [21,22]. In fetal kidney epithelial cells,AT2R activates Pax2 via JAK2 pathway [18]. Therefore, we pre-incubated NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration withPD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) toinvestigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II inducedPax2 expression in NRK-52E cells. We found that both AT2Rinhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor could block Ang II induced Pax2expression in NRK-52E cells, indicating that the stimulatory effectof Ang II on Pax2 expression in mature TECs is mediated byAT2R-JAK2 pathway.Renal Pax2 is down-regulated once nephrogenesis is completeand is not normally expressed in mature TECs. We believe thatthe re-expression of Pax2 in TECs is an initiating event of cellatavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic andcellular processes of tubular development. This process couldallow mature TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells. We provided evidence for this hypothesis by theobservation that a progenitor marker, CD24 [10],was transientlyexpressed in Ang II induced NRK-52E cells shortly after theexpression of Pax2. This model could also be supported by aprevious study which showed that a mesenchymal cell marker,vimentin, was expressed in the tubular epithelium during therecovery stage of AKI[8].Moreover, we found that both AT2R inhibitor (PD123319) andJAK2 inhibitor (AG490) which could not only block Ang IIinduced Pax2 expression, but CD24 expression as well in NRK-52E cells. This result indicaed a regulative role of Pax2 on CD24expression. We then used shRNA-mediated RNA interference ofPax2 to further determine the relationship between Pax2 andCD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II. We found thatknockdown of Pax2 expression resulted in an apparent suppress ofAng II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. These datademonstrate that CD24 is regulated by Pax2 in NRK-52E cellsstimulated with Ang II.In summary, our findings demonstrated that mature TECs canundergo an atavistic transition under the induction of acute injuryfactors such as Ang II. This atavistic transition allows matureTECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells, whichcould re-differentiate into TECs to restore tissue structure. Pax2might play a central part in this process. Currently, exogenousstem cells used for AKI treatment are difficult to obtain andextremely expensive. It is very likely that enhancing the atavistictransition of surviving TECs could be more effective than injectingFigure 3. Pax2 expressions in renal cortex detected by RT-PCR and western blot.

That might have important implications forfurther understanding of AKI treatment.Materials and MethodsAnimals and experimental model of AKIThe animal experiment was approved by the Medical EthicsCommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-senUniversity. All animal experimental studies were conducted inaccordance with the National Guidelines of Laboratory Animaluse and Care in China. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 g to 300 gwere obtained from the Experiment Animal Center of Sun Yat-senUniversity. Animals were maintained at a controlled temperatureof 2262uC with a 12 to 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access tofood and water.Animals were randomly divided into 12 groups of 6 animals pergroup. 6 groups received IRI operation and 6 groups receivedsham operation without IRI induction.Figure 4. IHC detection of Pax2 in renal cortex. IHC detection showed that Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs in the IRI groups24\u201396 h after IRI (A). The sham operation group did not show Pax2 expression in proximal tubules. The percentage of Pax2-positive proximal TECsincreased 24 h after IRI and reduced to a low level 120 h after IRI, peaking at 72 h after IRI (B) (*P,0.05, IRI compared with sham).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g004Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563The rats were fasted overnight prior to the operation andanesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% freshlyprepared chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg). Renal ischemia wasinduced by clamping both renal arteries with microserrefines.The clamps were removed after 45 min to re-establish blood flowin order to mimic the reperfusion injury. Sham operation groupsreceived surgery without IRI induction. The body temperaturewas monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37uC duringthe entire procedure by surrounding the animals with 37uC waterbags. The blood glucose levels and heart rate were measuredbefore, during, and after the operation. After surgery, the incisionswere sutured and rats were maintained in separated cages withfree access to food and water.Each group of rats was anesthetized with chloral hydrate at0,24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h after operation. Blood samples wereobtained by aspiration from abdominal vein. Blood ureanitrogen(BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were measured by a HITACHI7170A Analyzer (HITACHI). The kidneys were removed and therenal cortex parts were separated for the subsequent experiments.The animals were then sacrificed by injecting overdose of chloralhydrate and potassium chloride.Animals that did not show renal pathology changes or died afteroperation were excluded from the experimental groups.Histological studiesThe cortex parts of kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral bufferedformalin and embedded in paraffin; 2 mm thick sections were cuton a microtome (Rotationsmikrotom 3455 Leitz; Lecica), andhematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was carried out to document thehistological damage. Histological changes were examined via lightmicroscopy in a blinded fashion according to the Pallers standard[23].The immunohistochemical (IHC) studies were performed usingan indirect immunoperoxidase technique: 4 mm thick sectionswere cut from the cortex sections of kidneys embedded in paraffin.Figure 5.

The RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) data showed that 1029 mol/L of Ang IIcould stimulate CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells shortly after the expression of Pax2; Ang II induced CD24 expression was started from 1 h postexposure, reached a peak at 4 h and began to disappear at 6 h (*P,0.05, compared with Time = 0 h). (C) Immunofluorescence analyses showed thatCD24 was expressed at the surface of NRK-52E cells.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g009Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563(TOYOBO). PCR was performed in a 50 ml volume withTaKaRa PCR Kit (TaKaRa). The primers used for PCR arelisted below: For Pax2, the forward primer was 5\u2019-AACGGTGA-GAAGAGGAAACG-3 and the reverse primer was 5\u2019-GGAA-GACATCGGGATAGGAA-3\u2018 (244 bp). For CD24, the forwardprimer was 5\u2019-TCAAAAGTCACAACGGCAA-3\u2019 and the reverseprimer was 5\u2019- TCCAGTCCTCACATCCCAA-3\u2019 (257 bp). Forb-actin, the forward primer was 5\u2019-GCCCATCTATGAGGGT-TAC-3\u2019 and the reverse primer was 5\u2019-CTGGAAGGT GGA-CAGTGAG-3\u2019 (570 bp).The reactions were initially heated to 95 uC for 3 min and thensubjected to 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC, 30 s at 55uC, 30 s at 72 uC,Figure 10. PD123319 and AG490 block Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. NRK-52E cells were pretreated with PD123319(1026 mol/L) and the AG490 (1026 mol/L) for 10 min before Ang II (1029 mol/L) administration. Cells were harvest at 4 h post exposure for RT-PCRand western blot assays. Results of RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) showed that both the AT2R blocker PD123319 and JAK2 blocker AG490 couldblock the stimulatory effect of Ang II on CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells (*P,0.05).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g010Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563and a final extension at 72uC for 10 min in a PCR DetectionSystem (ABI 9700).

Cells and tissue samples were lysed for 1 hin a RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl,1% NP-40,) in the presence of 1 ml/ml phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF). The lysed samples were centrifuged at15,000 rpm for 20 min and boiled for 10 min. Protein concen-trations were measured with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime).Protein samples were separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotrans-Figure 11. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Ang II induced Pax2 in NRK52E cells. NRK-52E cells were transfected with Pax2 shRNA oremptily plasmid by lipofection method before Ang II administration. RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) data demonstrated that the transfection ofNRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression. The repression rate was 74.368.2% as judged bywestern blot (*P,0.05). Transfection with emptily plasmid vector pGenesil-1 failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2 shRNA was specificin that it failed to knock down the expression of unrelated protein b-actin.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g011Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563ferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PVDF membranes wereblocked with TBST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mMNaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 0.5 h.After washing with TBST, the membranes were probed with eachantibody as indicated.

The shRNA were sub-cloned intopGenesil-1 expression vector for transfection. The emptily vectorpGenesil-1 was used as vector control. The plasmids wereamplified and purified by Wuhan cell marker biotechnologyCo., Ltd (Wuhan, China)The RNAi experiment was conducted as previously de-scribed[6]. Briefly, cells were seeded 1 day before transfection ata density of 26106 cells/ml onto 35-mm plates in 2 ml of completemedium (DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS). Cells were divided into 4groups: Group A, serum-free medium alone; group B, Ang II(1029mol/L) stimulated; group C, shRNA and Ang II (transfectedwith pshRNA-Pax2-983 and stimulated with 1029mol/L of AngII); group D, empty vector control (transfected with pGenesil-1and stimulated with 102mol/L of Ang II).Plasmid transfection was performed according to the protocolby Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All cells were cultured incomplete medium for 24 h after 4 h of transfection. Cells werethen synchronized in serum-free medium fot 12 h. After that, cellsin groups B, C and D were treated with 1029mol/L of Ang II andcells in group A were treated with serum-free medium alone. Cellswere harvested at different time points for further experiments (1 hfor RT-PCR of Pax2, 2 h for western blot of Pax2, 4 h for RT-PCR and western blot of CD24).Statistical AnalysesThe data were expressed as Mean6SEM. The differencesbetween groups were assessed by Student\u2019s t test. A p value , 0.05was considered significant.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: YJ TJ JO.
