However, thesignal pathways that can augment the proapoptotic function of ROS remain largely unknown. We previously identified a tumorsuppressor, alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), yet little is known regarding the role of TAP in the apoptotic signalingin prostate cancer. Interestingly, we recently found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)resulted in induced apoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing ofendogenous TAP expression conferred effective protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic study showedexposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun, and TAP siRNAeffectively decreased H2O2-induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that JNKphysically associates with TAP. Furthermore, signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex and BH-3-only subfamily werefound to be regulated on changing the TAP expression status. TAP could also promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosiseffect of docetaxel. In the mice xenograft model, H2O2 treatment induced TAP expression, JNK phosphorylation and apoptosisof prostate cancer. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-TAP injection significantly sensitizes this H2O2 proapoptoticeffect. Together, we have identified a novel functional mechanism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in oxidativestress-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enabletherapeutic selectivity and provide benefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.IntroductionReactive oxygen species (ROS), which include oxygen ions,free radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are produced asnatural by-products during normal cellular metabolism andxenobiotic exposure.1,2 ROS function as double-edged swordsin the cells.

Recently, wefound that exposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted inapoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. TAP is widelyexpressed, with its highest expression in the organs of liver, brainand prostate.10 We had found that it exerts an antiproliferativeeffect via inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Aktpathway.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently found that TAP-accelerated ap-optosis in mesothelioma cells. Although TAP can bind vitamin E,some studies have suggested that TAP has functions that are notdependent of vitamin E binding.11,13 The exact role that TAP playsin oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling remains unknown.In this study, we showed that TAP plays a critical role tomodulate oxidative stress-induced apoptotic in prostate can-cer cells both in vitro and in vivo.ROS can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial deathpathways and other transcriptional pathways.14,15 JNK, an im-portant member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase fam-ily, has been shown to mediate apoptosis in response to cellu-lar stress.16\u201319 Activated JNK can phosphorylate c-jun andthereby induce the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member death pro-tein 5/harakiri upregulation.20,21 Upregulation of Bim andPuma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated cell apoptosis.19,21In this study, we found that exposure of prostate cancer cellsto H2O2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNKand c-Jun, and TAP small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectivelydecreased these effects, indicating that JNK activation wasrequired for TAP-mediated apoptosis on H2O2 treatment.Docetaxel has recently been shown to have significant sur-vival benefit for hormone refractory prostate cancer. Tradi-tionally, the mechanism of this agent is thought to involvethe hyperstabilization of microtubules and inhibition of mito-sis cytoskeletal restructuring. Recently, metabolic oxidativestress has also been suggested to play a role in the antitumoreffects of docetaxel.18 Treatment of docetaxel could increasethe production of hydroperoxides and cause oxidative stressin many human cancer cells. In this study, we also demon-strated that TAP was able to promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis effect of docetaxel.In summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha-nism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in ROS/H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The newfunction of TAP promoting ROS or doxetaxel-induced apopto-sis could be exploited as a valuable approach for the treatmentof prostate cancer. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cellsby this signaling may enable therapeutic selectivity and providebenefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.Material and MethodsCell culture and reagentsLNCaP and PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supple-mented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/strep-tomycin antibiotics and were maintained at 37\ufffdC in ahumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.22 H2O2,SP600125, docetexel, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl-L-cyste-ine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,MO). Donkey polyclonal anti-human TAP, bim, puma andGAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Bio-technology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibod-ies specific for total and phosphorylated JNK and c-jun werepurchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylatedp-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Fos werepurchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 preparationThe coding sequence of TAP-enhanced green fluorescentprotein (EGFP) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) from the pEGFP-N3-TAP plasmid, which was con-structed from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto) by insertingfull-length TAP isolated from the cDNA of benign prostatehyperplasia tissue. The primers were: 50-GCCGAATTCAT-GAGCGGCAGAGTC-30 (forward) and 50-GCCGCTAGCT-TACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-30 (reverse). After purification,What\u2019s new?Alpha-tocopherol associated protein (TAP) is a vitamin E-binding factor downregulated in several cancers. Here, the authorsshow that TAP potently promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/ROS-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, both in vitro andin vivo. Signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex was found to be involved. The authors speculate that reintroductionof TAP may be beneficial to overcome drug resistance in prostate cancer.CancerCellBiologyZhu et al. 2271Int. J. Cancer: 132, 2270\u20132282 (2013) VC 2012 UICCthe gene fragment was digested with EcoRI and NheI(Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The recombinant adeno-associatedvirus 2 (rAAV2) packaging plasmid pSNAV2.0 was obtainedby the simultaneous digestion of plasmid pSNAV2.0-LacZa(AGTC, Co., Ltd.) with EcoRI and NheI, followed by ligationusing T4 DNA ligase (Takara). The resultant plasmid,pSNAV-TAP-EGFP, was used to transform competent cells,and positive colonies were screened by PCR using the pri-mers shown above, followed by sequence analysis to identifythe correct recombinant clones. 293T cells were transfectedwith the purified pSNAV-TAP-EGFP plasmid, and viruseswere isolated by PEG8000/NaCl precipitation and chloroformextraction for purification. The purity was examined usingsodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(SDS\u2013PAGE), and the titer was determined by dot blot usinga radioactive probe specific for the rAAV2 transgene.rAAV2 viral infectionSubconfluent LNCaP or PC-3 cells were infected with par-ticles (2 \ufffd 1011 vector genomes) of rAAV2 encoding theEGFP-TAP sequence (rAAV2-TAP) or control viral particles.The infection efficiency was determined by the percentage ofcells expressing the viral-derived EGFP under a fluorescencemicroscope.Luciferase assayThe AP-1-Luc construct (an artificial reporter containingseven AP-1 agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate re-sponsive element sites) was purchased from Stratagene (Kirk-land, WA). The c-Jun-DN and a-Fos constructs were kindgifts from Mingtao Li, Ph.D. (Sun Yat-sen University,Guangzhou, China).LNCaP or PC-3 cells (1 \ufffd 105) were plated in each wellof 24-well dishes with 500 ml of regular growth medium atthe day before transfection. The medium was replaced withserum-free growth medium on the day of the transfection,which was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitro-gen, Carlsbad, CA) with a mixture containing 500 ng of AP-1-Luc plasmid and 1 ng of Renilla luciferase expression vec-tor (pRL-TK). After a 4 hr incubation, the transfection mix-tures were removed and 500 ml of normal growth mediumwas added to each well. Then, the cells were incubated for anadditional 18 hr. The luciferase activity of each well wasmeasured using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Madison,WI) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.siRNA transfectionTAP siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased fromAmbion (Lafayette, CO). The targeted sequences were 50-CCAAUUGUCCCAACCAUUUU-30 and 50-CAACGAGGC-CAUUGACUUCUU-30. The transfection was done accordingto the product\u2019s instruction. Briefly, PC-3 and LNCaP cellswere plated at 4 \ufffd 105 per well in six-well plates. On thenext day, cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or negativecontrol (NC) oligonucleotides using SIPORT (Ambion, Aus-tin, TX).RNA extraction, RT-PCR and western blot assayThe total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cellsusing Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To assessmRNA expression, RT-PCR was carried out with the RET-ROscriptVRkit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The primers for theTAP gene were: 50-CCAGGCAGAAGGAGGCATTG-30 (for-ward) and 50-TCGGAGCCAACGCAGGAG-30 (reverse). Thewestern blot analyses were performed as described in ourprevious study.11 The xenograft tumors were snap-frozen andstored at \ufffd80\ufffdC before processing. The proteins wereextracted from cultured cells and xenograft tumors, and equalamounts of proteins were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE. The pro-teins bound to nitrocellulose membranes were incubatedovernight at 4\ufffdC with primary antibodies and then incubatedwith secondary peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Amer-sham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The proteins weredetected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-plus,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) followed byautoradiography. GAPDH served as the loading control.Immunoprecipitation and immunoblottingCell lysates were prepared from mock-infected or rAAV2-TAP-infected cells and subsequently incubated with proteinA/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4\ufffdC,centrifuged, washed five times with lysis buffer and separatedby SDS\u2013PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The SDS\u2013PAGE was followed by immunoblot analyses using anti-TAP(1:200) or anti-JNK (1:1,000) antibodies.Assessment of intracellular ROSThe levels of ROS induced by H2O2 or docetaxel in LNCaPand PC-3 cells were measured using 2,7-dichlorodihydro-uorescindiacetate (DCFH-DA) as a fluorescence probe. Cellswere washed with PBS twice and incubated with DCFH-DA(10 mmol/L) for 30 min at 37\ufffdC. Then the cells were washedthree times with PBS. The photos of DCF-DA fluorescencewere immediately recorded and quantified. The intensity ofDCF fluorescence was also detected by flow cytometry, withexcitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm.Apoptosis analysisApoptosis was evaluated by annexin V and 7-AAD bindingassay using the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BDBiosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. At least 1 \ufffd 106 cells in each sample were ana-lyzed. Control cells stained with annexin V-PE or 7-AADalone were used as NCs for the flow cytometric analysis.Tumor formation in nude mice and rAAV2-TAP injectionA xenograft tumor model was established as described in ourprevious study.11,22 Briefly, the flanks of 4-week-old malenude mice were injected subcutaneously under anesthesiaCancerCellBiology2272 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancerInt.

Tumor growth wasmonitored regularly, and the volumes were calculated usingthe formula length \ufffd width2 \ufffd 0.5. The tumor tissues wereharvested for further analysis. All of the mice were main-tained and handled in accordance with the institutionalguidelines and a protocol approved by the Sun Yat-sen Uni-versity (Guangzhou, China).Immunohistochemistry analysisImmunohistochemistry analyses were performed as previ-ously described.11,22 The isolated mice xenograft tumors werefixed in 10% buffered formalin and then dehydrated in agraded series of ethanol. The tissues were embedded in paraf-fin and then cut into 5-mm-thick sections. The deparaffinizedsections were incubated with TAP (1:600), JNK (1:1,000) orphospho-JNK (1:1,000) primary antibodies at room tempera-ture for 1 hr. After washing in PBS, the sections were incu-bated with secondary antibody and ABC solution followed by3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining (DAKO, Carpinteria,CA) and counterstaining with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin.TUNEL assayA terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPnick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect apopto-sis of prostate cancer xenografts. The assay was performedusing the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (POD; Roche, In-dianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The prostate cancer sections were incubated with DAB sub-strate solution followed by counterstaining with hematoxylinfor 5 min, dehydration and mounting before observationunder a light microscope.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t-tests performed by SPSS software were used toanalyze the significance of the differences between the treat-ment and control groups. The data are presented as themeans 6 SE. P values less than 0.05 were considered to bestatistically significant.ResultsTAP is involved in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosisin prostate cancer cellsExposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to H2O2 resulted in dose-and time-dependent upregulation of TAP mRNA and proteinlevels compared with the control. Moreover, the inductions ofboth TAP mRNA and protein were blocked by NAC andGSH, the scavengers of intracellular ROS, confirming thatTAP was indeed induced by oxidative stimulation (Figs 1a\u2013c).The prostate cancer cells were transfected with TAPsiRNA or NC and were subjected to western blot and apo-ptosis analysis. As shown in Figure 1 d1, the upregulation ofTAP induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished by TAPsiRNA compared to the control. This finding verified the effi-cacy and specificity of the TAP siRNA.As shown in Figures 1 d2 and 1 d3, compared with theNC, TAP siRNA conferred the effective protection fromH2O2-induced apoptosis (6.9 vs. 18.9% in PC-3 cells, p <0.05; 9.8 vs. 26.3% in LNCaP cells, p < 0.05). Moreover,there was no significant difference in the levels of apoptosisamong the three groups in the absence of H2O2 treatment,suggesting that H2O2-mediated oxidative stress is requiredfor TAP-promoted apoptosis. This is consistent with our pre-vious finding that TAP alone cannot induce apoptosis.11 To-gether, these results indicate that TAP plays a critical role inthe apoptosis of prostate cancer cells initiated by oxidativestress.To further study TAP function, we constructed a recombi-nant AAV2 vector encoding the EGFP-TAP sequence(rAAV2-TAP). PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with vi-ral particles for 72 hr, and EGFP expression detected by fluo-rescence microscopy showed that the rate of infection washigher than 80% (data not shown).The PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with rAAV2-TAP. After 72 hr, the cultures were stimulated with 200 mMH2O2 for 2 hr, and then were subjected to quantification ofapoptosis. As shown in Figure 1e, there was no significantdifference among the three groups in the absence of H2O2treatment. However, when H2O2 was added, overexpressionof TAP significantly promoted apoptosis compared with therAAV2-vector control. There was no significant effect causedby the rAAV2-TAP infection technique on the viability ofthe cells (as revealed by infection with the rAAV2-vectorcontrol, Fig. 1e).Under H2O2 stimulation, silence or upregulate, the expres-sion of TAP had no significant effect on the ROS levels inboth LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 1f1, f2).Taken together, our data demonstrate that TAP acceler-ates apoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in response to oxida-tive stress.Activation of JNK is required for the TAP-acceleratedapoptosis signalingIt is widely known that JNK is a key mediator of ROS-induced apoptosis in many cell types.18,23 Therefore, weaimed to investigate whether JNK activation was required inthis process. As shown in Figure 2a, in PC-3 and LNCaPcells, H2O2 treatment activated JNK in a time-dependentmanner; the changes in the levels of c-Jun and phospho-c-Jun were paralleled to the phosphorylated levels of JNK,which is consistent with previous studies.24As shown in Figure 2b, treatment of H2O2 resulted in anincreased level of TAP and phospho-JNK in PC-3 andLNCaP cells, while scavenging of intracellular ROS by NACCancerCellBiologyZhu et al. 2273Int.

JNK activation is involved in TAP-mediated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. (a) JNK is known to beactivated after H2O2 treatment. Prostate cancer cells were treated with 200 mM H2O2. At the indicated time points, the cultures were harvested.Western blotting analyses were performed with antibodies against JNK, phospho-JNK, c-jun and phospho-c-jun (PC-3 cells: a1, LNCaP cells: a2).(b) NAC and GSH block the activation of JNK induced by H2O2. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were treated with NAC (20 mM) or with GSH (5 mM) for30 min, then were exposed to 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr. Western blotting analyses were performed (PC-3 cells: b1, LNCaP cells: b2). (c) SiRNA-mediated knockdown of TAP attenuates the activation of JNK and c-jun induced by H2O2. Cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or with NC for48 hr, then were exposed to 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr.

Asterisk indicated p < 0.05). [Colorfigure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]or by GSH abolished TAP expression and phospho-JNK andphospho-c-jun induction significantly. These results indicatethat both JNK and TAP mediate ROS-dependent signaling inprostate cancer cells.Moreover, knockdown of TAP in the presence of H2O2abrogated phospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun induction (Fig.2c). Conversely, overexpression of TAP robustly increasedphospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun; however, there were no de-tectable changes in the absence of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2d).SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK,25 was also used tocharacterize the relationship between TAP and JNK.SP600125 effectively inhibited JNK activation, as demon-strated by the significant decrease in phosphorylation levelsof both JNK and c-jun; however, this inhibitor had no effecton TAP (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2e, results offlow cytometric analysis showed that SP600125 effectivelyreversed the TAP-dependent induction of apoptosis (31.6 vs.10.1% in PC-3 cells, p < 0.05; 37.9 vs. 12.4% in LNCaP cells,p < 0.05).TAP physically interacts with JNKThe above results demonstrate that TAP manipulates theactivation of JNK and that JNK modulates the TAP proapop-totic effects. To explore the possibility that TAP may regulateJNK activation, coimmunoprecipitation experiments wereperformed.As shown in Figure 3a, under normal condition (withoutH2O2 treatment), TAP and JNK had no direct interaction.However, when the cells were treated with H2O2, there hadprominent interaction between TAP and JNK (Fig. 3b). Thesedata indicate that under oxidative stress condition, JNK inter-acts with TAP in prostate cancer cells.The AP-1 complex contributes to TAP-mediated oxidativestress-induced apoptotic signalingUnder oxidative stress condition, cellular c-Jun and c-fos usu-ally form stable homodimeric or heterodimeric complexeswhich are important downstream effectors of JNK signaling.16AP-1 is involved in many different important cellular proc-esses, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Asc-Fos is an important dimerization partner of c-Jun, we exam-ined whether it was involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis.As shown in Figure 4a, western blotting confirmed that c-Fos expression was rapidly induced by H2O2, the upregula-tion of c-Fos induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished byTAP siRNA, which is in agreement with previous studies.17c-Fos induced by H2O2 was also sensitive to treatment withPD95059 and UO126, two structurally distinct MEK inhibi-tors that block the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.Next, we evaluated whether H2O2-dependent induction ofc-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation and c-Fos expression leadsto the transactivation of AP-1. We tested the ability of H2O2to activate the AP-1-responsive collagenase promoter fused toa luciferase reporter gene (AP-1-Luc). As in Figure 4c, H2O2treatment increased luciferase activity compared with thecontrol. H2O2-induced AP-1-Luc transactivation was sensitiveto treatment with either SP600125 or UO126. Moreover, theaddition of c-Jun\u2013DN (a dominant negative mutant thatlacks the transactivation domain and can compete with en-dogenous c-Jun for binding to c-Fos) or addition of the trun-cated form of c-Fos (a-Fos) resulted in an significant inhibi-tion of the transactivation of the AP-1 promoter. The effectof TAP on AP-1 transactivation was also evaluated. Asshown in Figure 4d, TAP siRNA partially attenuated the ac-tivity of the AP-1 promoter. Overall, these findings suggestthat both TAP- and JNK-specific activation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression contribute to AP-1 activation by H2O2.We next examined whether c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimeriza-tion is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by flow cyto-metric assays. As shown in Figure 4e, overexpression of c-Jun-DN significantly protected PC-3 and LNCaP cells fromapoptosis. This protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis inprostate cancer cells may be attributable to the disruption ofc-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers. If this is true, the blockage of c-Fos should confer the similar protection against apoptosis inthe cells. Indeed, expression of a-Fos in PC-3 and LNCaPcells attenuated the apoptosis in comparison to the vectorcontrol (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, when TAP was depleted byTAP siRNA, this effect was partially attenuated (Fig. 4e). To-gether, these findings suggest that TAP contributes to the c-Figure 3. TAP associates with JNK.

The cultures were harvested; western blotting analysis wereperformed with antibodies against TAP and c-Fos. (PC-3 cells: a1, LNCaP cells: a2). (b) Cells were untreated or stimulated with 200 mM H2O2for 2 hr. PD95059 and U0126, distinct MEK inhibitors that can block the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, were added to the cells.

The JNK/c-Jun pathway has been shownto regulate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochon-dria. Bim and Puma are two members of the proapoptoticBH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins.21 Upregulation of Bimand Puma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated apoptosis.19As shown in Figure 4f, the expression of Bim and Pumacould be induced by H2O2, whereas both c-Jun\u2013DN anda-Fos prevented H2O2-induced Bim and Puma upregulation.When TAP was depleted by TAP siRNA, the above effectwas partially attenuated, indicating that TAP is involved inthe upregulation of members of the AP-1 complex-mediatedBH3-only subfamily (Bim and Puma) in the signaling ofH2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.TAP enhances the docetaxel-induced apoptosis in prostatecancer cellsDocetaxel and paclitaxel had been found to kill cancer cellspartially by inducing intracellular ROS.18 As shown in Fig-ures 5a and 5b, exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to doce-taxel had elicited significant increase of intracellular ROSlevel. The addition of NAC or GSH could reverse theincreased ROS levels induced by docetaxel.Then the effect of TAP on the oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis induced by docetaxel was studied. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were infected with the rAAV2-TAP virus or with thevector control virus. Seventy-two hours later, the cultureswere treated with 0.5 nM docetaxel for 48 hr and then weresubjected to quantification of apoptosis. As shown in Figure5c, overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosisinduced by docetaxel compared with the vector control. Theaddition of NAC following the treatment of docetaxel led toa reduction of apoptosis induced by docetaxel even when therAAV2-TAP virus was infected.These results suggested that TAP could enhance doce-taxel-induced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in prostatecancer cells.TAP enhances H2O2-mediated suppression of tumor growthin vivoHaving demonstrated that TAP was able to sensitize the cul-tured prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induced by H2O2 invitro, we next detected the effect of rAAV2-TAP virus in thexenografts of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in nude mice. Comparedwith the control group, H2O2 treatment significantly decreasedthe tumor size of the xenografts (Fig. 6a). Pretreatment withrAAV2-TAP virus further suppressed the tumor growth com-pared with the control virus. Consistent with the growthcurves, the tumor weight was also significantly reduced byrAAV2-TAP combined with H2O2 compared with H2O2 treat-ment alone.Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that TAP washighly expressed in the rAAV2-TAP group, confirming thattreatment with rAAV2-TAP was effective in the nude mice.Moreover, TUNEL staining revealed that rate of apoptosiswas higher in the mice treated with the combination ofrAAV2-TAP and H2O2 compared with the treatment ofH2O2 alone. This is in accordance with the reduced tumorgrowth rate, as well as the reduced tumor weight. The immu-nohistochemical staining results of p-JNK, JNK and c-JUN inthe xenograft sections had confirmed the molecular signalingof TAP in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6b).Taken together, these data indicated that TAP sensitizes pros-tate cancer xenograft to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.DiscussionIn this study, we had identified a new signal pathway thatcould augment the ROS-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancercells. TAP was shown to have proapoptotic function underconditions of oxidative stress. JNK may function as a keydownstream of TAP and modulate its proapoptotic effects.The crystal structure of TAP suggests that it contains anNH2-terminal CRAL-TRAL domain with a small lipidligand-binding cavity and a COOH-terminal GOLD domainthat is involved in protein\u2013protein interactions.10,26 A previ-ous study showed that TAP/supernatant protein factor bindsto alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and improves vitamin Euptake, thus enhancing vitamin E function.11 A deficiency inTAP has been linked to several cancers, including breast andprostate cancer.11,23,27 We previously found that the expres-sion of TAP is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer,which is associated with tumor cell proliferation, as well aswith an increased risk of cancer recurrence.23,24 Overexpres-sion of TAP inhibits prostate cancer growth in the absence ofvitamin E both in vitro and in vivo through suppression ofthe PI3K/AKT pathway.11 However, the role of TAP in theapoptosis signaling remains largely unknown. In our previousstudy, we showed that TAP alone did not induce prostatecancer cell apoptosis.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently showed thatTAP accelerates alpha-tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptosisin mesothelioma cells. Because alpha-tocopheryl succinate isassociated with accumulated intracellular ROS,25 their studysuggested a correlation between TAP and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Until now, no clear evidence has sup-ported an association between TAP and apoptosis induced byoxidative stress. Here, we report for the first time that TAP isupregulated during H2O2-induced apoptosis, overexpressionof TAP sensitizes both LNCaP and PC-3 cells to the apopto-sis induced by oxidative stress. This partially explains whyTAP expression is lower in prostate cancer cells comparedwith benign prostate cells. The decreased expression of TAPmay represent an intrinsic escape mechanism of tumor cells.Indeed, the ROS levels are higher in prostate cancer cellscompared with benign prostate cells, and high ROS levels areconsidered to be an inherent requirement of an aggressivephenotype.5CancerCellBiology2278 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancerInt.

Cancer: 132, 2270\u20132282 (2013) VC 2012 UICCNumerous pieces of evidence indicated that JNK signalingcascade is a crucial player during ROS-mediated apopto-sis,16,17 despite the contradictory notion that JNK is requiredfor cell survival and proliferation.16,17 In the present study,we found that JNK activation is required for TAP-mediatedapoptosis upon H2O2 treatment. Although H2O2 treatmentalone is enough to evoke JNK activation, we found that themodulation of TAP expression by TAP siRNA or rAAV2-TAP could decrease or further increase JNK activation,respectively, and that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversesthe proapoptotic effect of TAP, suggesting that JNK functionsas a downstream target of TAP.As a protein kinase, modulation of JNK activity occursmainly through its phosphorylation. Because TAP is not aprotein kinase, it is impossible for TAP to regulate JNK viadirect phosphorylation. Given the structural characteristics ofTAP,26 we hypothesize that TAP might interact with JNKand protect phospho-JNK from dephosphorylation by phos-phatases or facilitate JNK phosphorylation by upstream ki-nases. Indeed, the intracellular phosphorylation and dephos-phorylation components coexist with apoptotic stimuli, andtheir balance decides the phosphorylation level of a protein.In this study, we found TAP physically interacts with JNK(Fig.). However, more conclusive evidence is needed toexclude the possibility that TAP and JNK operate in two par-allel signaling pathways and to support the hypothesis thatTAP protects JNK from dephosphorylation.ROS are produced by all aerobic cells and act as secondmessengers in cellular signaling. It is widely accepted thatROS play vital roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and necro-sis, depending on their concentrations.2,28 Traditionally, over-production of ROS and aberrant redox balance are consid-ered to be the underlying causes of the pathogenesis of manydiseases, including cancer.5,29,30 Mounting evidences sug-gested that compared with their normal counterparts, manytypes of cancer cells have increased levels of ROS. In theprostate gland, ROS are considered to be oncogenic and arerequired for the development and progression of cancer.5However, recent studies have also shown that excessive ROSbeyond a particular threshold can induce pathophysiologicalchanges such as apoptosis, cell cycle disruption and necrosisin cancer cells, which suggests that elevation of ROS levelscould serve as a therapeutic strategy.1,30 Cancer cells adapt tohigh levels of ROS by activating ROS-scavenging enzymes,redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-jB, Nrf2, c-Jun and HIF-1, which lead to the increased expression ofantioxidant molecules such as SOD; catalase thioredoxin andthe GSH antioxidant system. Abrogation of this adaptiveredox homeostasis mechanism is an attractive new approachto improving therapeutic outcomes. Many chemotherapeuticmedicines have a mechanism of killing cancer cells viaROS.18 Therefore, some studies have proposed ROS-basedtherapies for cancer treatment.1,30H2O2 is a common form of ROS that can easily permeatethe cellular membranes into the cytoplasm. External applica-tion of H2O2 is widely used in wound treatment, but otheruses are limited because it can cause deleterious effects, suchas air embolisms and chemical burns of the skin and mucousmembranes. In this study, our results showed that local injec-tion of H2O2 combined with rAAV2-TAP effectively inducedapoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells and suppressed thetumor growth in vivo, without air embolisms or other detect-able adverse effects. Following treatment with 200 mM H2O2,overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis com-pared with the control, therefore, TAP sensitizes prostatecancer cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.AAV is a kind of replication-defective nonenveloped par-vovirus that can infect both dividing and nondividingcells.31 Because its genome can incorporate into the hostcells, including human cells and it is currently known tohave an acceptable safety profile. AAV is an attractive can-didate for gene therapy.32\u201335 There are many serotypes ofAAV. Among them, AAV2 is the most popular one for sci-entific research.34,36,37 In this study, the recombined AAV2was shown to be able to deliver TAP into PC-3 and LNCaPcells and into the xenograft prostate tumor tissues effec-tively. It could also promote the oxidative stress-inducedapoptosis significantly without apparent adverse effects. Theefficiency and the safety of rAAV2-TAP in inhibiting pros-tate cancer growth provide a strong rationale and the exper-imental basic for further studies.In summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha-nism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in the ROS/H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disruptingthe redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enablethe therapeutic selectivity and provide benefits to overcomethe drug resistance of prostate cancer.AcknowledgementThe c-Jun-DN and A-Fos constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Mingtao Li(Department of Pharmacology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-senUniversity, Guangzhou 510080, China).References1.
