Animals were injected withthe cytokine, and 4 h later, a homogenate from the cortical and medullary tissues was prepared and used to assay the activity of the Na\u00feeK\u00feATPase and the protein expression of the pump and symporter. TNF-a reduced the activity and expression of the pump in both cortex andmedulla, and its effect disappeared when animals were pre-treated with indomethacin, suggesting that TNF-a acts via PGE2. Higher levelsof PGE2 were detected by enzyme immunoassay, in kidney tissues isolated from rats treated with PGE2, thus confirming this hypothesis.The cytokine also down-regulated the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffdcotransporter but this effect was not abrogated by indomethacin. PGE2, injected intoanimals, exerted a dose-dependent effect. Low doses did not have any effect on the two transporters in the cortex while high doses inhibitedand down-regulated the pump and up-regulated the cotransporter. In the medulla low doses increased the activity and expression of thepump but down-regulated the cotransporter while high doses exerted an exactly opposite effect on the two transporters. It was concludedthat the effect of TNF-a on the pump is mediated via PGE2 which is released at relatively high doses. The effect of the cytokine on thecotransporter is, however, independent of PGE2.\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionTumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatorycytokine with a wide range of biological effects. It plays a cen-tral role in shock due to sepsis [1,2] and has been implicated,directly or indirectly, in the pathogenesis of renal failure [3,4].The cytokine is released by the thick ascending limb of theloop of Henle in rats challenged with LPS, and was shown toexert cytotoxic effects and interfere with ion transport mecha-nisms across epithelia [5]. Dogs infused with TNF-a hadmarked nartriuresis and polyuria [6].Since one of the major functions of the kidney is the regu-lation of body fluid osmolality and electrolyte balance, TNF-a* Corresponding author.

The Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPasealso known as the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump is a key transporter thatregulates the activity of many others. It is a highly conservedintegral membrane protein, which couples ATP hydrolysis toNa\u00fe and K\u00fe transfer across the plasma membrane against theirelectrochemical gradient [7]. By establishing Na\u00fe and K\u00fe gra-dients across the cell membrane, it provides the driving forcefor the activity of other transporters like the Na\u00fe/H\u00fe and theNa\u00fe/Ca2\u00fe exchangers and the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporterthat regulates, respectively, cytoplasmic pH, Ca2\u00fe levels, andcellular volume. The Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump also drives a variety ofsecondary active transport processes in the nephron like thoseinvolving amino acids and glucose reabsorption. The ATPaseis a heterodimer expressed in all the different segments ofmailto:sawkreyd@aub.edu.lbhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666139S.I. Kreydiyyeh, S. Markossian / Cytokine 33 (2006) 138e144the kidney tubules and is composed of two functional subunits:a catalytic a subunit (w110e113 kDa) containing the bindingsites for ATP, sodium, potassium, phosphate and cardiac gly-cosides [8] and a b subunit (w35e55 kDa glycoprotein)needed for the activity of the enzymatic complex [9]. Theb subunit also facilitates plasma membrane localization andis responsible for the early structural and functional matura-tions of the a subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum [8]. Sev-eral isoforms of both a and b subunits have been identifiedand all of them are capable of forming functionally active en-zymes [10]. They are expressed in different cell types contrib-uting in each to multiple specialized properties [11]. The a1and b1 subunits perform housekeeping functions, and arehighly expressed in the kidney. In the rat, their abundance ishighest in cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs ofthe loop of Henle and the proximal convoluted tubule [12].Another important transporter in the kidney is theNa\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC) cotransporter which couples the move-ment of 1Na\u00fe with 1K\u00fe and 2 Cl\ufffd. The symporter uses thepotential energy released by the downhill movement of Na\u00feand Cl\ufffd to drive the uphill movement of K\u00fe into the cell. Twoisoforms have been identified: NKCC1, present in the basolat-eral membrane of a wide variety of secretory epithelia; andNKCC2, present only in the medullary region of the kidney[13,14], and localized to the apical membrane of the epithelialcells [15]. In epithelia, the cotransporter is responsible for thenet transcellular Cl\ufffd movement from one side of the cell to theother. By raising intracellular Cl\ufffd above electrochemical equi-librium, it provides the driving force needed for Cl\ufffd exit onthe other side of the cell.It is apparent that both the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump and theNa\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd symporter play a crucial role in the regulationof electrolyte movements across kidney tubules, and in the in-direct maintenance of body fluid osmolality. The importance ofthese two transporters incited us to investigate whether theyconstitute target sites for TNF-a action. The aim of this workwas to study the effect of TNF-a on the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump andthe Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC1 in particular) transporter in kidneycells isolated from rats treated in vivo with the cytokine.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animal treatmentMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were usedand were handled all through in accordance with the Guide forLaboratory Animal Facilities and Care, US Department ofHealth, Education and Welfare.Rats weighing around 250 g were injected i.p. with TNF-a(170 ng/100 g body weight) 4 h prior to the beginning of theexperiment, or with different doses of PGE2 (21 and0.37 mg/100 g BW) 15 min before the beginning of theexperiment. These time points were chosen based on a similarwork studying the effect of TNF-a in the rat distal colon(unpublished data). When indomethacin was used, it wasinjected i.p. (1 mg/100 g BW) 10 min before TNF-a. TNF-awas dissolved in physiological saline. Ethanol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as respective vehicles forPGE2 and indomethacin. A similar volume of the vehicleswas injected into control rats.To ensure that any observed effect is due to TNF-a and not dueto a contaminant like the lipopolysaccharide, TNF-a was heatedfor 20 min at 70 \ufffdC and its effect on the pump was studied.2.2. Preparation of kidney cortical and medullaryhomogenatesRats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital(5 mg/100 g body weight) and their abdomen were openedthrough a lateral incision. The intestine and stomach werepushed aside to expose the left kidney for its perfusion withTris buffer (buffer A: 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2$6H2O;2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4).A heparinized catheter was introduced into the aorta just abovethe level of the left renal artery to allow the infusion of thebuffer. The mesenteric artery and the right renal artery wereboth ligated. The left renal vein was cut for drainage. The leftkidney was perfused for 10 min with Tris buffer at a rate of5 ml/min until cleared from blood. The bleached kidney was ex-cised, its capsule removed, cut longitudinally and small piecesfrom the cortex and medullary tissues were then removed andhomogenized in Tris buffer for around 5 min with a polytron(20 000e22 000 rpm) at 4 \ufffdC. Protease inhibitors were addedto the samples which were kept at \ufffd20 \ufffdC for later use.2.3. PGE2 assayKidneys were isolated from animals treated with TNF-a.Cortical and medullary tissues were immediately excised,cut into small pieces, and homogenized in presence ofindomethacin at 4 \ufffdC to inhibit any additional PGE2 synthesis.Total PGE2 (intracellular and extracellular) extraction andassay were conducted using an enzyme immunoassay kitfrom Amersham Biosciences (PGE2 Biotrak EIA system) fol-lowing exactly the protocol described by the manufacturer.2.4. Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase assayA crude membrane homogenate was prepared by spinninghomogenized cells at 3300\ufffd g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC. Membranehomogenates were then diluted in Tris buffer (buffer A) toa final concentration of 2 mg/ml protein and incubated for30 min with saponin (0.02% final concentration) at room tem-perature. After a pre-incubation at 37 \ufffdC for 10 min in thepresence or absence of ouabain (4 mM final concentration),the reaction was initiated by addition of ATP to a final concen-tration of 1.25 mM, and terminated after a 1-h incubation at37 \ufffdC by addition of trichloroacetic acid (200 ml, 11%). Theamount of inorganic phosphate liberated was measured color-imetrically according to the method of Taussky and Shorr [16],and the activity of the enzyme was determined by measuringthe ouabain-inhibitable inorganic phosphate liberated.140 S.I.

Western blot analysisMembrane proteins were quantified using the Bio-Radreagent and were equally loaded and resolved on 8% poly-acrylamide gels, then transferred onto a PVDF membrane(Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules,CA 94547, USA) . Protein expression of b actin was used tocheck the equal loading. The PVDF membrane was thenwashed, blocked and incubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with a rabbitanti-Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase a-1 IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, LakePlacid, NY 12946, USA), or with an anti-rat sodium potassiumchloride cotransporter antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Interna-tional, TX, USA). Detection of the signal was by enhancedchemiluminescence using luminol reagent (Santa CruzBiotechnology Inc., CA, USA).Autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry usinga Gel-Pro(2) Analyzer software. The intensities of the signalsare reported as a percentage of the control value.2.6. Statistical analysisResults are reported as mean\ufffd SEM.

Effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the activityand protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPaseTNF-a decreased the protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00feATPase in both kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 1). This effectdid not appear when heated TNF-a was used. Indomethacin,an inhibitor of COX enzymes, did not have any effect on theexpression of the pump and in its presence, the down-regulatoryeffect of the cytokine did not appear.The effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the pump activ-ity followed a similar trend. The cytokine reduced the ATPaseactivity down to around 40% of its control value (Fig. 2). Thisinhibitory effect disappeared, however, in the presence ofindomethacin.3.2. Effect of heated TNF-a, TNF-a, and indomethacinon the protein expression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffdcotransporterThe protein expression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporterwas not affected by indomethacin in both cortex and medulla(Fig. 3), but was significantly reduced by TNF-a even in thepresence of indomethacin.3.3. Effect of TNF-a on PGE2 levels in the kidneyTNF-a caused a significant increase in the level of PGE2 inboth kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 4).3.4. Dose-dependent effect of PGE2 on the activity andprotein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPaseLow doses of PGE2 (0.37 mg/100 g BW) injected intoanimals up-regulated the pump in the kidney medullary cells(Fig. 5) and increased its activity (Fig. 6), but were withoutany effect on the ATPase in cortical cells (Figs. 5 and 6).High doses (21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the activityand protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase in both cortexand medulla (Figs. 5 and 6).3.5.

DiscussionThis work demonstrated a TNF-a-induced decrease in theactivity and protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump inboth renal cortex and medulla. The decrease in activity wasascribed to the reduction in the abundance of enzymemolecules.This effect did not appear, however, when the rat was pre-injected with indomethacin, an inhibitor of COX enzymes,suggesting that the effect of the cytokine is mediated throughPGE2. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the observedincrease in renal PGE2 levels induced by TNF-a, and sup-ported by many other works reporting a PGE2-mediated effectof TNF-a. The cytokine for example was reported in the liter-ature to induce cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in pri-mary cultures of the medullary thick ascending limb [17] andincrease PGE2 synthesis in mesangial cells [18] and bovinechondrocytes [19].AABAaaba0%20%40%60%80%100%120%Control Indomethacin% Control ActivationCortexMedullaTNF TNF +IndomethacinFig. 2.

Letters above the bars indicate signifi-cant differences. Bars sharing a common letter are not significantly different;P< 0.05.Another effect of TNF-a demonstrated in this work was thedecrease in protein expression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC)cotransporter in the cortex and medulla (Fig. 3), an effectthat was not abrogated by indomethacin and which is not con-sequently dependent on PGE2.Two isoforms of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter (NKCC)are known to be present in mammalian tissues: NKCC1 andNKCC2 [20e24].The isoform studied in this work is the NKCC1. A decreasein the abundance of this cotransporter is expected to reduce thetransepithelial NaCl transport from the serosal to the mucosalside into the tubular lumen, and may come as a consequenceof the TNF-a-induced decrease in the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase activ-ity which provides the driving force for this symporter. It isalso in line with the reported diuretic and natriuretic effectsof TNF-a [6].TNF-a signaling is a very complex process. TNF-a canactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclearfactor kappa B (NF-kB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), prote-ases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species [25]. On theother hand the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd is regulated by phosphoryla-tion/dephosphorylation or changes in its gene expression[26]. The abundance of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter inthe thick ascending limb of the kidney was found to be regu-lated by vasopressin via a cAMP-mediated increase in thetranscription of its gene, which contains a cAMP regulatory el-ement [27]. Recently, TNF-a was shown to reduce cAMPlevels by targeting the enzyme adenylate cyclase througha mechanism involving NF-kB [28]. Thus in this study,TNF-a may have down-regulated the cotransporter by reduc-ing the basal level of cAMP, thus decreasing the transcriptionba051015control TNF  PGE2 (ng/mg protein) PGE2 (ng/mg protein) Medulla ba024681012control TNFCortexFig. 4.

This path-way, however, is still speculative and would need to be con-firmed by future experimental work.It can be concluded that TNF-a affects the pump and thesymporter via, respectively, PGE2-dependent and PGE2-inde-pendent pathways.Injection of the animals with a low dose (0.37 mg/100 gBW) of the prostaglandin did not affect the activity nor theprotein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump in the kidney cortex,but increased both significantly in the medulla. A higher dose(21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the ATPase activity andprotein expression in both cortex and medulla, and thus ex-erted a similar effect to that observed with TNF-a. The resultssuggest that the cytokine induces the release of PGE2 at levelshigh enough to induce inhibition and down-regulation of thebaaCBA0%20%40%60%80%100%120%140%160%180%200%control 0.37 21% Control ActivityCortexMedullaFig. 6.

The decrease in pump activity correlated here againvery well with the decrease in its expression and was ascribedto a reduction in the number of the ATPase molecules.This dose-dependent response to the prostaglandin may beattributed to the activation of different types of PGE2 receptors(EP receptors) having different signal transduction pathwaysand different affinities for the prostaglandin. EP1 receptorsare known to signal via an increase in intracellular calcium[29e31] and are present in the collecting duct, increasing inabundance from the cortex to the papillae [32].

Activation of these receptors was shownto inhibit renal Na\u00fe and water reabsorptions and contributes tonatriuresis and diuresis. EP2 and EP4 are coupled to a Gs pro-tein and cause an increase in cAMP levels [34,35]. EP2 recep-tors exhibit a low level of expression in the kidney and theirprecise localization is uncertain [36] while EP4 was detectedin the collecting duct [32] and in the glomerulus [37].EP3 receptors are expressed in the medullary thick ascend-ing limb and collecting duct. When activated they inhibitcAMP generation via Gi [33] and are consequently expectedto exert an opposite effect to that of EP2 and EP3.Many hormones and mediators are known to exert a long-or a short-term regulatory effect on the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase.Short-term regulation usually involves changes in the kineticsof the enzyme or its translocation between the plasma mem-brane and intracellular stores. Protein kinases, mainly PKCand PKA, were shown to play a major role in this regulation.In the kidney, inhibition of the sodium pump in proximalsegments of the nephron was reported to be mediated throughG protein-linked PKC-dependent pathways [38,39], whereasin distal segments, PKA-associated pathways are involved[40,41]. Activation of the pump by PKA in the renal proximaltubule was demonstrated to be secondary to an increase in itstranslocation to the plasma membrane [42]. Similarly inhibi-tion of the pump was shown to come as a consequence ofits phosphorylation by PKC at Ser-23 [43e45].In some cases PKA was shown to regulate the pump indi-rectly by altering the activity of other Na\u00fe transporters andconsequently intracellular Na\u00fe which in turn leads to a changein the ATPase activity [46].It has also been suggested [47] that phosphorylation of therat Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase at Ser-23 by PKC requires prior phos-phorylation by PKA at Ser-943.In this work EP1 and EP4 are suspected to mediate the effectof high doses of PGE2 because they have a lower affinity for theprostaglandin than EP3 [35] and activate, respectively, PKCand cAMP signaling which have been shown to inhibit bothNa\u00fe and water reabsorptions in the thick ascending limb ofthe loop of Henle and the collecting duct [48]. EP3 may be in-volved in the up-regulatory effect PGE2 observed at low dosesin kidney medulla due to its higher affinity for PGE2 and itsmechanism of action which involves a decrease in cAMP pro-duction resulting in an increase in Na\u00fe transport [36].Different doses of PGE2 also exerted a dual trend on theexpression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd symporter. Low doses had noeffect in the cortex while high doses caused an up-regulationof the cotransporter. In the medulla down-regulation wasobserved at low doses while an opposite increase in the sym-porter expression was observed at high doses. Thus, at alldoses studied, the effect of PGE2 on the cotransporter wasopposite to its effect on the pump. When the pump wasdown-regulated and inhibited, the cotransporter was up-regulated and vice versa. The two transporters are thus work-ing in concert to regulate NaCl uptake from the tubular lumenand consequently water. The opposite effect observed at highdoses may come as a form of negative feedback mechanism,or a way by which the same mediator can be used, dependingon its level to exert opposite effects on salt reabsorptiondepending on body needs.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a grant from the UniversityResearch Board.References[1] Beutler BA, Milsark IW, Cerami A.
