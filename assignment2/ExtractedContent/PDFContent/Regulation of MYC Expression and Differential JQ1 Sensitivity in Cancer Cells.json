JQ1, a chemical compound that inhibits MYCexpression is therapeutically effective in preclinical animal models in midline carcinoma, and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (BL). Herewe show that JQ1 does not inhibit MYC expression to a similar extent in all tumor cells. The BL cells showed a ,90%decrease in MYC transcription upon treatment with JQ1, however, no corresponding reduction was seen in several non-BLcells. Molecularly, these differences appear due to requirements of Brd4, the most active version of the PositiveTranscription Elongation Factor B (P-TEFb) within the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), and transcription factors such asGdown1, and MED26 and also other unknown cell specific factors. Our study demonstrates that the regulation of high levelsof MYC expression in different cancer cells is driven by unique regulatory mechanisms and that such exclusive regulatorysignatures in each cancer cells could be employed for targeted therapeutics.Citation: Fowler T, Ghatak P, Price DH, Conaway R, Conaway J, et al.

The two mostcommon forms of aggressive NHL are diffuse large B celllymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (BL) [1,2,3].Translocation of the proto-oncogene MYC into one of theimmunoglobulin gene loci [IG-MYC translocation; mostly of thet(8;14)q24;q32 type] resulting in aberrant MYC expression isregarded as the dominant genetic event in the genesis of BL andabout 10% of DLBCL [4]. Besides translocation, MYC canundergo oncogenic deregulation via high-level gene amplificationas well as mutations in cis-regulatory elements in several cancertypes (e.g., myeloma, colon carcinoma and neuroblastoma) [5,6].Moreover, while most BLs have deregulated c-MYC (henceforthreferred to as MYC) expression as a consequence of an IG-MYCtranslocation, the majority of non-BLs do not carry IG-MYCtranslocations, but other genetic abnormalities leading to dereg-ulated MYC expression. Though high expression is restricted toBLs, MYC target expression varies on a lower level across non-BLand intermediate lymphomas and constitutes a negative prognosticmarker in these lymphomas.MYC dimerizes with MAX to bind its target sequence (E-box)and regulate gene expression. MYC not only activates transcrip-tion but also represses target gene expression either via directbiding (with Miz-1 transcription factor) or via regulation of micro-RNAs (miRs) [7]. However, the function of MYC is complicatedas two recent studies show that MYC does not have a specifictranscriptional signature but serves to amplify the output ofexisting transcriptional programs in a given cell rather thanexecuting its own transcriptional program [8,9].MYC belongs to a class of genes called Primary Response Genes(PRGs) many of which harbor paused Pol II at the proximalpromoter area that upon activation can quickly switch to anelongating Pol II and functional transcription [10]. Signaldependent stimulation results in enhanced acetylation at histone3 lysine 14 (H3K14Ac) and either of two H4 lysine pairs, H4K5/12 or H4K8/16, an event which appears crucial for the binding ofbromodomain (BRD) proteins that recruit transcription factorsnecessary for transcription [11,12]. Recruitment of positivetranscription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), and possibly thegeneral initiation cofactor Mediator, plays an important role inBrd4-regulated transcription of many genes including MYC.Indeed, after recruitment by Brd4, P-TEFb phosphorylates theelongation factors DSIF (Spt4 and Spt5), negative elongationfactor (NELF), and Pol II resulting in release of paused Pol II andsubsequent elongation of transcription [10,13] and recentlyreviewed in [14]. Collectively, these and other results suggest thatPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003elongation of transcription is a critical regulatory point inorchestrating MYC regulation [10].As many MYC-driven processes are required for homeostasisand growth, therapeutic strategies geared towards modulation ofMYC expression rather than outright suppression seem attractive.The Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation first describedthienodiazepine analogs that potently inhibit chromatin bindingof bromodomains related to the BET family [15]. Subsequently, aclosely related small molecule inhibitor, JQ1, has been found to betherapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models [16,17,18].These and related small molecules competitively occupy theacetyl-binding pockets of BET bromodomains, resulting in releaseof BET proteins (in particular Brd4) from chromatin [19]. Despitethese promising demonstrations, JQ1 does not inhibit MYCexpression to a similar extent in all tumor cells [19]. Thus, it isimportant to understand why JQ1 is effective in only certain MYC-dependent cancers, which may ultimately determine clinicalefficacy of this compound in patients.We observed that although JQ1 treatment decreased Brd4occupancy to a similar degree in the cell types tested, the ability ofJQ1 to reduce MYC transcription between cells differed. In JQ1-sensitive cells, inhibition occurred at the level of nascenttranscription affecting Pol II, \u2018\u2018paused\u2019\u2019 Pol II-Ser5-P, \u2018\u2018elongat-ing\u2019\u2019 Pol II-Ser2-P, and P-TEFb occupancy. Furthermore, there isa difference in the occupancy of members of the Super ElongationComplex (SEC), and factors associated with RNA Polymerase II,at MYC promoter regions in the two cell types. Collectively, ourdata indicate high levels of MYC are maintained in different cancercells via distinct mechanisms at the level of transcriptionelongation with different compliments of transcription factorsand are therefore subjected to different JQ1 sensitivity.Materials and MethodsCell CultureThe mature mouse B cell lymphoma BAL17 [20], human BLlines Akata [21], Raji [22], and Ramos [23], and human epithelialline HeLa-S3 [24] were cultured in RPMI media with HEPES(Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 mg/mlStreptomycin, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 0.5 mM 2-Mercaptoeth-anol solution (Invitrogen) and 10% Fetal Calf Sera (AtlantaBiologicals).

The University of California SantaCruz Genome Web Browser setting normalized to the highestpeak at the TSS.ResultsDifferential JQ1 SensitivityWe performed dose- and time-dependent testing of Brd4inhibition with JQ1 and noted the effect on MYC transcriptionin a variety of cells including HeLa-S3 cells, whose MYCexpression was reported [19] to be resistant to JQ1 treatment.Shown in Fig. 1A, tested cell lines express MYC at high levels,comparable to levels detected at the peak of primary na\u0131\u0308ve restingB cell induction (data not shown). Steady state mRNA levels ofMYC in a non-BL murine B cell lymphoma line (BAL17) that overexpresses MYC at levels similar to the BL cells and HeLa cellsshowed no significant sensitivity to JQ1 (Fig. 1A). Both HeLa andBAL17 cells continued this resistance at concentrations up to5 mM (data not shown), while MYC RNA in BL cells was uniformlydecreased by ,90% when treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for a periodof two hours (Fig. 1A). BL cells are reported to express 2- to 5-foldmore MYC-specific RNA than B-cell lines without a translocation[30]. Although Western blotting d indicate the Raji BL lineexpresses more MYC protein, consistent with the mRNA data(Fig. 1A), JQ1 treatment decreased MYC protein expression inRaji but not HeLa and BAL17 (data not shown). Together theseresults demonstrated that JQ1 resistance occurred in both non-lymphoma and lymphoma cell lines representing both murine andhuman species.Because mRNA production may not necessarily correlate withprimary transcript production [25,31], we tested the effect of JQ1on primary transcription. Analysis of primary transcript, per-formed with primers against the exon/intron borders of MYC(schematically represented in Supplemental Fig. 3 and/or listed inMaterials and Methods), showed that primary transcriptionsensitivity to JQ1 was parallel to that of mRNA (Fig. 1B). Thus,long, and presumably full-length, primary transcripts were eitherresistant (BAL17 or HeLa) or sensitive (Raji) to JQ1. Therefore,the difference in JQ1 responses correlated with primary transcrip-tion and did not occur at the level of post-transcriptionalmodification, such as splicing and mRNA or protein stability.Divergent transcription is common of many promoters inorganisms and plays an important role in gene regulation [32].Indeed, antisense transcription from the MYC locus has beenobserved in several cell lines [33]. Because we only measured totalsteady state RNA (Fig. 1A), whether differential JQ1 sensitivityreflects differences in possible transcription originating from the 39end was tested. Although antisense transcription in both BAL17Figure 3. Effects of JQ1 on P-TEFb occupancy. BAL17 and Raji cells were either untreated or treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for 2 hours. Recruitmentof P-TEFb was detected by ChIP assays. Each experiment was analyzed in triplicate via real-time PCR, performed twice, and is reported as the meanand standard deviation of the two experiments.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087003.g003Myc RegulationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003and HeLa cells was small in comparison to sense transcription, itwas largely unaffected by JQ1 (Fig. 1C, left and middle panels).The wide difference in levels of sense and antisense transcriptsobserved amongst different cell lines is currently unexplained butmight reflect a combination of transcriptional and post-transcrip-tional effects. Regardless, like sense transcription, antisensetranscription originating from the MYC locus in Raji cells wasinhibited by JQ1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Therefore, although moreantisense transcription was noted in Raji cells, the difference inJQ1 sensitivity was not likely due to differences in antisensetranscripts.JQ1 Leads to Decreased Brd4 Occupancy in Resistant andSensitive CellsWe observed that Brd4 recruitment was reduced by JQ1 in bothcell types\u2013therefore, the difference in JQ1 sensitivity betweendifferent cells was not due to permeability. We also observed thatBrd4 recruitment to the transcription start site (TSS) was roughly2.5 fold more in Raji (+11) cells compared to BAL17 (+17)(Fig. 2A). HeLa exhibited Brd4 recruitment and JQ1 sensitivitysimilar to BAL17 (data not shown). Moreover, a significantamount of Brd4 occupancy was noted across the body of MYC inall the cells tested, though there was a higher level of coding regionoccupancy in BAL17 cells. Though commonly associated with 59-end enhancers and promoters, Brd4 has been shown to occupy thecoding region of PRGs such as c-fos and MYC [26].Promoter recruitment of Brd4 requires phosphorylation at S484and S488 and deletion of this region results in decreased CycT andPol II occupancy and transcription [26]. Consistent with the ChIPassay, Western blotting showed a higher level of total Brd4 in Rajinuclear extracts compared to HeLa and BAL17, although Brd4-S484P/S488P in Raji cells was slightly less compared to BAL17and HeLa (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the P-BRD4 band in HeLa cellsmigrated faster than either the Raji or BAL17 P-Brd4 band,perhaps reflecting a slight difference in the extent or site ofphosphorylation. However, the difference in phosphorylated Brd4(the active form) between different cells might not explain thedifferences in JQ1 sensitivity.Brd4 interacts with factors that either recruit Pol II to the site oftranscription or drive the transcriptional complex from pausing toFigure 4. RNA Polymerase II occupancy in the absence and presence of JQ1. Cells were either untreated or treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for 2hours. (A) Pol II was detected by antibody against the N-terminal of Pol II (B) Pol II Serine 5-P (C) Pol II Serine 2-P. Chromatin ChIP assays wereperformed in duplicate. Each experiment was analyzed in triplicate via real-time PCR, performed twice, and is reported as the mean and standarddeviation of the two experiments.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087003.g004Myc RegulationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003the elongation mode (reviewed in [10]). Additionally, a reductionof functional Brd4 resulting in greatly reduced Pol II occupancywas shown to involve a loss of P-TEFb [26]. Although the leveland pattern of P-TEFb occupancy in both untreated JQ1 sensitiveand resistant cell types were similar, JQ1 treatment/Brd4inhibition decreased P-TEFb occupancy only in Raji cells(Fig. 3). These results indicated levels of BRD4 dependence formaintaining P-TEFb occupancy vary in different cell lines (Fig. 3).RNA Pol II RecruitmentWe next determined if the difference in JQ1 selectivity was dueto a difference in general transcription apparatus recruitment,represented by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). While total Pol II wasgreatly decreased across the body of MYC in Raji cells upon JQ1treatment, it was not altered in the JQ1 resistant BAL17 line(Fig. 4A). Both cell types showed Pol II occupancy at the P0promoter, which has been shown to correlate with a very highlevel of transcription [34]. Many actively transcribed genes(including MYC) exhibit paused Pol II at their proximal promoters[35]. Consistent with this notion, we observed a high level ofpromoter-associated Pol II in both cell types, although two-foldmore Pol II was noted at the proximal promoter (roughlycorresponding to the P0 promoter region) in BAL17 (2354)compared to Raji (2279). Interestingly, as noted with Brd4 and P-TEFb (Figs. 3 and 4), total Pol II was reduced at a site immediatelydownstream (+0.6 kb) of the TSS and sharply increased afterward(Fig. 4A).Because phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain(CTD) of RNA Pol II is associated with regulation of transcriptioninitiation and elongation at many promoters [36,37], we analyzedthese events in the two cell types in the absence and presence ofJQ1. While RNA Pol II phospho-Ser5 (Pol II S5P) levels in BAL17cells remained stable after JQ1 treatment, Pol II S5P levels in Rajicells were sensitive to JQ1 (Fig. 4B). However, surprisingly, Pol IIS5P levels were refractory at P0 and TSS sites (Fig. 4B, right panel)but sensitive in the latter half of the gene with a small changestarting downstream of the MYC P3 promoter (+2244) andbecoming increasingly sensitive further down the body of the gene.Whether the substantial amount of Pol II-Ser5P 39 occupancyshown here is directly due to 39 Brd4 occupancy or anoverabundance of transcription complexes \u2018\u2018backing up\u2019\u2019 resultingin reduced elongation and subsequent pausing at the 39 terminus isunknown.While Ser5 phosphorylation is associated with a competent butpaused Pol II, Ser2 phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD (Pol II S2P)represents elongating Pol II [37]. In the absence of JQ1, Pol II S2Poccupancy in both cell types occurred across the body of the genewith peaks at the promoter regions, and the 39 end. Surprisingly,while promoter- and TSS-associated Pol II S2P levels in Raji cellswere sensitive to JQ1, downstream regions past P3 exhibited noJQ1 sensitivity until past the 39 UTR (+5472) (Fig. 4C), suggestingthat the majority of fully elongating RNA polymerase II in theseJQ1 sensitive cells was refractory to JQ1. We also observed a JQ1-dependent increase in Pol II-Ser2P in the BAL17 line and whilethis increase was slight at the promoter and TSS regions, it wasvery clear at the 39 terminus.Differences in H3K36me3One possible way to delineate between upstream and down-stream effects on Pol II-Ser2 occupancy is to determine the patternof tri-methylation of the histone 3 residue lysine 36, H3K36me3,which is indicative of a recently passing elongating transcriptioncomplex [37]. In BAL17 cells, JQ1 treatment enhanced theH3K36me3 signals across the gene (Fig. 5). But in Raji cells, JQ1treatment decreased H3K36me3 from P0 through TSS until theP3 region. However, beyond P3, the H3K36me3 becamerefractory to JQ1 (Fig. 5) as observed with Pol II S2P (Fig. 4C),suggesting that once RNA Pol II was in elongation mode, it wasFigure 5. Effects of JQ1 on H3K36me3 status. Cells were either untreated or treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for 2 hours. ChIP assays were performedin duplicate. Each experiment was analyzed in triplicate via real-time PCR, performed twice, and is reported as the mean and standard deviation ofthe two experiments.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087003.g005Myc RegulationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003insensitive to JQ1. Together, our data showed that MYC harboredtranscription complexes with variable Brd4 dependency indifferent cell types and that Brd4 inhibition resulted in adifferential response at the level of transition from pausing toelongation.Accessory Transcription Elongation FactorsP-TEFb frequently functions as a subunit of Super ElongationComplexes (SEC), consisting of P-TEFb and a mixture of one ofthree ELL family members, one of two EAF family members, oneof two AF4 family members (AFF1 and AFF4), and either ENL orAF9 [29,38]. As the SEC family of Pol II elongation factors arereported to contain the most catalytically active versions of P-TEFb active in high-level transcription and to regulate acheckpoint stage of transcription associated with elongation[29,39,40], we looked at SEC recruitment at MYC in differentcell types. AFF4 is reported to serve as a central binding platformfor elongation factors in many SEC formations and to target MYCand regulate its expression in cancer cells [39]. The level of AFF4occupancy in BAL17 cells was low and refractory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A,top panel) but increased in the presence of JQ1. In contrast, AFF4recruitment in Raji cells was much greater and sensitive to JQ1.Although the AFF4 promoter occupancy in Raji cells, particularlyaround 2244 site, was variable in the absence of JQ1, it wassignificantly decreased in the presence of JQ1. Moreover,consistent with the Pol II S2P and H3K36me3 results, JQ1sensitivity was lost past the P3 promoter region (+2244), once againsuggesting that the elongating transcription complex was refrac-tory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A, bottom panel).We subsequently looked at occupancy of another SECcomponent, ELL2, which has been reported to play a role inthe transition from paused Pol II to elongation [40]. We also testedoccupancy of the Mediator component (MED26) as well asGdown1. Though first linked to initiation, a role for Mediator inrecruiting Pol II transcription elongation factors and phosphory-lation of the Pol II CTD regulating Pol II pausing and elongationhas emerged [41]. The Mediator complex most strongly associatedwith Pol II includes MED26, which has been shown to increaseactivation of transcription in vitro to a greater degree than otherforms of the Mediator complex and play a key role in SECrecruitment and MYC transcription [41]. Gdown1 is a Pol IIbinding protein shown to be necessary for a Mediator-dependentresponse to activation of transcription [42]. More appropriate toFigure 6.

Given the differences focusedaround the P3 region, we focused on the general promoter region(P0, TSS, and P3) to test the differences between these cell lines. Asobserved for BAL17 cells, HeLa cells exhibited low AFF4recruitment at this region in comparison to Raji cells (Fig. 6B).Consistent with AFF4 recruitment results, increased ELL2occupancy near P3 was seen in Raji cells compared to HeLacells. MED26 occupancy showed a pattern similar to that of otherSEC components with an increase, though more modest, near theP3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B). Finally, we observed thatGdown1 followed a pattern similar to that of SEC and Mediatorwith an increase around the P3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B).DiscussionDue to the importance of MYC in the genesis of hematopoieticmalignancies, intense efforts have been directed for the past twodecades toward understanding its regulation. Yet, given that MYCoverexpression is caused by a plethora of genetic lesions, a uniformset of rules governing its transcriptional regulation is still missing.Recent advances in this area include the discovery of a smallmolecule inhibitor, JQ1 that decreases MYC expression and istherapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models of midlinecarcinoma and in BL cells. However, JQ1 does not inhibit MYCexpression to a similar extent in all cancer cells, furtherunderscoring that MYC transcription is perhaps under differentcontrols in various cancer cell types. Consistent with this notion,we discovered that JQ1 inhibits MYC expression in all BL-derivedcells tested but does not inhibit MYC expression in some othercancer cell lines, as observed earlier (19). Because MYCderegulation can occur via different modes, we hypothesized thatin distinct lymphoma phenotypes, high-level MYC expression maycome under the controls of different transcriptional and epigeneticregulatory mechanisms, which may be sensitive or resistant toJQ1/Brd4 inhibition. In this study, we explored these mechanismsto establish MYC transcriptional and epigenetic signaturesassociated with particular cell types with the hope that thesesignatures will better define lymphoma subtypes and provide newtherapeutic avenues to explore for clinically aggressive B celllymphomas.Although BL cells are a heterogeneous lot with differences in thelength of Ig/MYC translocation that reportedly translate tovariable levels of MYC overexpression [43], BL cells in our hands(Fig. 1 and Figure S1, in File S1), and others [19], are uniformlysusceptible to inhibition of MYC expression via Brd4 inhibition byJQ1. This inhibition appears to be regardless of whether these areFigure 7. Proposed Model.

Brd4 isprimarily associated with 59-end promoters and enhancers[44,45,46], and while we do see a more prominent level of Brd4at the TSS in Raji cells (Fig. 2), we also observe Brd4 occupancyacross the body of the MYC gene in JQ1 resistant cells (Fig. 2). Onefunction of Brd4 is P-TEFb recruitment and P-TEFb occupancydoes parallel Brd4-inhibitor sensitive MYC transcription, despitethe fact that there is little difference in P-TEFb occupancy inuntreated cells of either resistant or sensitive cells. Therefore, itappears that in cells resistant to JQ1, a Brd4-independentmechanism operates to recruit or retain P-TEFb and producehigh levels of MYC transcription.Because the SEC components AFF4 and ELL2 play a role inMYC regulation and transcriptional elongation, we hypothesizedthat an increase in these co-factors might relax Brd4 requirements.Surprisingly, their increased presence actually correlated withincreased requirements for Brd4 (Fig. 6). The position of increasedSEC components together with MED26 and Gdown1 around theP3 promoter suggests high transcriptional activity or a regulatorycheckpoint in this region that is not present in cells that areresistant to JQ1 (summarized in Figure 7). It has been noted that inBL cells, due to MYC-IG translocation, the otherwise minor P3promoter often becomes active and correlates with higher MYCexpression [43]. Coupled with the recent demonstration that thetranslocated MYC locus harbors super enhancers that are sensitiveto JQ1 [45], this raises the possibility that the mechanism oftranscriptional regulation of MYC involving its native/non-translocated enhancer is different (Fig. 7B, Figure S2, in File S1).Regulation of transcription at the MYC minor promoters,including P3, has been shown to involve the P-TEFb regulator7SK snRNA, which participates in transformation-dependentMYC deregulation [47]. 7SK snRNA is a complex of RNA andproteins such as LARP7 and HEXIM1 that are known to stabilizeP-TEFb in an inactive form [13,14,47]. JQ1 also leads to therelease of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP and to HIV geneexpression that involves an increase in AFF4 and ELL2 [48,49].Moreover, while JQ1 inhibited MYC expression in BL lines tested,it enhanced BCR stimulated induced transcription of c-fos in thesecells (Figure S1, in File S1). Thus, the effects of Brd4 inhibition byJQ1 appear more complicated than has been previously antici-pated.Much is known about the different MYC promoters and theirpossible functions in oncogenesis. BAL17 and HeLa cells maybehave like GLC4 cells, where MYC is transcribed at a high ratebut not grossly rearranged [50]. That MYC transcription in GLC4is reported to initiate mainly from P1 instead of the P2 promoterand that this promoter shift seems to overcome transcripttermination at a transcriptional pause site described for Burkitt\u2019slymphoma [50]. In the future, it will be interesting to conclusivelydetermine if any difference in cell-specific primary transcriptionand MYC promoter usage is driving, or being driven by, thedifferences in transcriptional elongation regulation we report here.Point mutations could also play a role in differential JQ1 sensitivitythough a search of available UCSC Genome Browser tracks onlyfinds one SNP reported in the general vicinity of the P1/P2promoter (data not shown).Altered regulation at the elongation stage of transcription hasbeen proposed to contribute to leukemic pathogenesis [29,51].While many PRGs such as MYC have a well-recognizedcheckpoint at +40 to the TSS that is associated with pausedtranscription [52,53], our data indicate that an additional potentialcheckpoint near the region around P3 may be utilized differentlydepending upon the mode of MYC overexpression. In the nearfuture, we hope to employ different MYC-driven lymphomasamples to test whether the transcriptional signatures that weobserve here correlate with the particular MYC genetic lesion(translocated versus non-translocated).Supporting InformationFile S1 File includes Figures S1\u2013S3.
