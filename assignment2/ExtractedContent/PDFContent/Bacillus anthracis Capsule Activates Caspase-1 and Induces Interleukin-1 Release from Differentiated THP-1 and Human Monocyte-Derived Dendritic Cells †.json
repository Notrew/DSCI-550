The antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveil-lance and allows unimpeded growth of bacilli in the host. Recently, efforts have been made to include PGA asa component of anthrax vaccine; however, the innate immune response of PGA itself has been poorly inves-tigated. In this study, we characterized the innate immune response elicited by PGA in the human monocyticcell line THP-1, which was differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) andhuman monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hMoDCs). PGA capsules were isolated from the culture supernatantof either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a. PGA treatment ofdifferentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs led to the specific extracellular release of interleukin-1\ufffd (IL-1\ufffd) in adose-dependent manner. Evaluation of IL-1\ufffd processing by Western blotting revealed that cleaved IL-1\ufffdincreased in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after PGA treatment. Enhanced processing of IL-1\ufffd directly correlatedwith increased activation of its upstream regulator, caspase-1, also known as IL-1\ufffd-converting enzyme (ICE).The extracellular release of IL-1\ufffd in response to PGA was ICE dependent, since the administration of an ICEinhibitor prior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1\ufffd. These results demonstrate that B. anthracis PGAelicits IL-1\ufffd production through activation of ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, suggestingthe potential for PGA as a therapeutic target for anthrax.Anthrax is a highly lethal infectious disease caused by thespore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis (24). After enteringthe host, anthrax spores are rapidly exposed and phagocytosedby antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages anddendritic cells (DCs), and carried to regional lymph nodes (25,27). Normally, at this stage, APCs act as the first line of defenseagainst microbial pathogens by engulfing and killing infectiousagents. In addition to macrophages, immature DCs have thenreported to capture anthrax spores by phagocytosis and mi-grate to lymphoid organs, and the lymph nodes, where theyliaise with and activate antigen-specific T cells (2). Macro-phages and immature DCs both produce numerous modula-tors of the inflammatory response to recruit and activate ad-ditional cells of the immune system, which link to the adaptiveimmune response (5). During this process, however, anthraxspores are able to survive, germinate into vegetative bacilli,multiply, and escape the control of the innate immune system(25, 27). The vegetative form of B. anthracis then penetratesinto the circulatory system by disrupting these cells, secreteshigh levels of exotoxin, and spreads systemically, reaching 108organisms per ml of blood (20, 25, 27, 39). Because APCs areused to bypass the host immune system in B. anthracis infec-tion, it is important to define the interactions between APCsand spore as well as the virulence factors of B. anthracis.The major virulence factor of B. anthracis, exotoxin, is com-posed of three distinct proteins\u2014protective antigen (PA),edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF)\u2014which are secretedseparately as nontoxic monomers (24). The binding of LF orEF to PA results in the formation of active lethal toxin (LT) oredema toxin, respectively (24). LF is a metalloprotease thatcleaves most isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase ki-nase (MAPKK) (15), and EF is a calmodulin-dependent ade-nylate cyclase that causes a prolonged increase of cytosoliccyclic AMP (22, 31). B. anthracis contains another virulencefactor, the capsule, which is composed of poly-\ufffd-D-glutamicacid (PGA) (24). The weakly immunogenic and antiphagocyticPGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance ina similar manner to that of the capsular polysaccharides thatprotect pathogens such as pneumococci and meningococci (12,23). Like other T-cell-independent polysaccharide antigens,the immunogenicity of PGA is enhanced when it is conjugatedwith other proteins such as PA (4, 35, 38). Recently, oraladministration of high-molecular-weight PGA to C57BL/6mice revealed natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antitumor ac-tivity and gamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd) secretion (18), which in-dicates a role for PGA in the immune response. However, theimmunogenic effect of PGA on APCs, including downstreameffectors such as cytokines, remains to be elucidated.In the present study, we have characterized the innate im-* Corresponding author.

PGA capsuleswere isolated from the culture supernatant of either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 (37) or B. licheniformisATCC 9945a (35). PGA treatment of differentiated THP-1cells and hMoDCs induced significant amount of the proin-flammatory cytokine IL-1\ufffd in a dose-dependent mannerthrough the activation of caspase-1, also known as IL-1\ufffd-con-verting enzyme (ICE). The production of other proinflamma-tory cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and IL-18 wasnot affected by PGA treatment. These results indicate thatPGA, as well as exotoxin, involves the regulation of the innateimmune response by macrophages and DCs. The present studyis the first to examine the immunological effects of B. anthracisPGA both in vitro using human macrophage cell line and exvivo with hMoDCs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and culture conditions. THP-1, a human monocytic cell line, wasobtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Cellswere grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-strepto-mycin (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incu-bator containing 5% CO2. Cellular differentiation into the macrophage-likephenotype was induced by the addition of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)at a final concentration of 100 nM. After incubation for 72 h, PMA-containingmedium was aspirated, and adherent cells were resuspended in fresh culturemedium and incubated for an additional 24 h.Generation and characterization of hMoDCs from peripheral blood mononu-clear cells (PBMC). According to Korea National Institute of Health Guidelines,PBMC were prepared by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia,Uppsala, Sweden) from buffy coats (Korean Red Cross Blood Service). CD14\ufffdcells from PBMC were separated by using MACS magnetic cell sorting (MiltenyiBiotec, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Purity of separated monocytes was \ufffd90% as de-termined by flow cytometry. Monocytes were cultured for 6 days in RPMI 1640supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin,20 ng of human IL-4 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)/ml, and 100 ng of humangranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (BD Biosciences)/ml. Differ-entiated hMoDCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) andstained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies on ice for 30 min to analyze theimmunophenotype of DCs. The anti-mouse antibodies used were as follows:fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD11c, FITC-conjugatedanti-CD14, FITC-conjugated anti-CD40, FITC-conjugated anti-CD80, FITC-conjugated anti-CD83, FITC-conjugated anti-CD86, and FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR. Mouse FITC-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) was usedas isotypic control. After three washes in PBS, the stained cells were fixed with1% paraformaldehyde in PBS until subjected to flow cytometric analysis using aFC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). (See also thesupplemental material.)Purification of PGA. B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a was obtained from theATCC and grown in E broth medium (35). PGA was purified from the cellculture supernatant as described previously (35). In brief, the highly viscousbacterial culture was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C (6,500 \ufffd g, 20 min) to remove bacteria.The supernatant was collected and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol at 4\u00b0Covernight. PGA precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed againstdeionized water. PGA solution was acidified to pH 1.5 with 6 M HCl andimmediately precipitated with 3 volumes of 1-propanol at \ufffd20\u00b0C. PGA wascollected by centrifugation and washed twice with acetone and once with ethylether. The purified PGA was then dissolved in water, dialyzed extensively, andlyophilized. Because of the large size of PGA from B. licheniformis (\ufffd500 kDa),direct addition of isolated PGA to THP-1 cell or hMoDC cultures would resultin an increase in viscosity, which might be undesirable for determining immuneresponses. Therefore, PGA was degraded to molecular sizes ranging from 15 to30 kDa (30-kDa PGA) by using acid hydrolysis. Fragmented PGA was verified by1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be 99% pure (data not shown).B. anthracis H9401 is a clinical isolate from a Korean cutaneous anthraxpatient (37) and grown in brain heart infusion medium (Difco Laboratories,Detroit, MI). B. anthracis H9401 is fully virulent and possesses both pXO1 andpXO2 plasmids. For the purification of PGA, pXO1 of B. anthracis H9401 wascured as described previously (14). The PGA from pXO1 cured strain of B.anthracis H9401 was purified from the cell culture supernatant by using the samemethod for B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a.Reagents. The ICE inhibitor Z-WEHD-FMK (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,MN) was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide to make a stock solution of 20 mM.ICE inhibitor was applied 30 min prior to PGA application. Trypan blue stainingshowed that Z-WEHD-FMK had no effect on THP cell and hMoDC viability(data not shown). Antibodies for ICE, IL-1\ufffd, and \ufffd-actin were obtained fromCell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (WestGrove, PA).ELISA. IL-1\ufffd cytokine levels were determined by using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems). Culture supernatantsfrom differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs stimulated with PGA were har-vested, and absorbance readings were generated by using a Techan absorbancemicroplate reader (Phoenix Research Products, Hayward, CA). Each culture wasassayed in triplicate and averaged. ELISA results are expressed in pg/ml.Western blotting. To produce cell lysates, the cell pellet was resuspended in100 \ufffdl of 1\ufffd lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitormixture (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The celllysates were clarified by microcentrifugation, and 50 \ufffdg of each clarified lysatewas loaded on a 10% NuPage gradient gel (Invitrogen). The lysates were elec-trophoretically separated and then transferred to 0.2-\ufffdm nitrocellulose mem-branes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Blots were blocked in TBS-T(100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]; 0.9% NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skimmilk for 1 h. Blots were rinsed three times in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for5 min and subsequently incubated with the diluted primary antibodies accordingto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions: rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-1 (1:1,000),anti-cleaved IL-1\ufffd (1:1,000), and anti-\ufffd-actin IgG (1:1,000). Horseradish perox-idase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; Jackson Immunoresearch)was used as the secondary antibody. After three washes with TBS-T, the blotswere developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford,IL) and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak XAR5; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY).RESULTSPGA induces specifically IL-1\ufffd production in differentiatedTHP-1 cells and hMoDCs. First, we investigated the effects ofPGA isolated from culture supernatants of either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a oncytokine production in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Dif-ferentiated THP-1 cells were treated for either 24 or 48 h withisolated PGA at the concentration of 100 \ufffdg/ml, and thensupernatants were collected and analyzed for production of apanel of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, andIL-1\ufffd. PGA did not increase extracellular IL-4, IL-6, and IL-18levels produced by differentiated THP-1 cells (data notshown). The IL-1\ufffd level was, however, increased by treatmentwith PGA from both sources. The treatment of THP-1 cellswith various concentrations of PGA (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100\ufffdg/ml) for either 24 or 48 h was tested, and this momentincreased production of IL-1\ufffd in a dose-dependent manner(Fig. 1). The extracellular IL-1\ufffd level from THP-1 cells treatedwith PGA from B. anthracis was an average of 4.5-fold greaterthan the baseline level at the concentration of 100 \ufffdg/ml after48 h treatment (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the extracellular IL-1\ufffdlevel from THP-1 cells treated with PGA from B. licheniformis9945a was an average of 4.2-fold greater than the baseline level(Fig. 1B).To test ex vivo relevance of the IL-1\ufffd production by PGAtreatment in DCs, we studied the effect of PGA on IL-1\ufffdproduction in hMoDCs. Similarly, the treatment of hMoDCswith various concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 \ufffdg/ml) of388 CHO ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.PGA for either 24 or 48 h also increased the production ofIL-1\ufffd in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The extracellularIL-1\ufffd level from hMoDCs treated with PGA from B. anthraciswas an average of 10.5-fold greater than the baseline level atthe concentration of 100 \ufffdg/ml after 48 h of treatment (Fig.2A). Similarly, the extracellular IL-1\ufffd level from hMoDCstreated with PGA from B. licheniformis 9945a was an averageof 12.5-fold greater than the baseline level (Fig. 2B).PGA increases the processing of IL-1\ufffd through the activa-tion of ICE in differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs. IL-1\ufffdis an potent mediator of inflammation that is responsible forvarious effects associated with host responses to microbial in-vasion and tissue damage (9, 10). IL-1\ufffd is expressed as aninactive form (33 kDa), pro-IL-1\ufffd, which is processed by thecytosolic cysteine protease ICE to generate its active form (17kDa) (11, 13). The production of extracellular IL-1\ufffd is regu-lated at several levels, including posttranslational cleavage ofits proform and extracellular release of its active form (36). Tofurther investigate the effect of PGA on IL-1\ufffd regulation, theeffect on IL-1\ufffd processing by PGA was studied by Western blotanalysis. A commercial antibody that detects the cleaved formof IL-1\ufffd (17 kDa) was used for Western blotting, with \ufffd-actinas a control. The level of cleaved IL-1\ufffd (17 kDa) started toincrease ca. 2 to 3 h after PGA treatment in differentiatedTHP-1 cells (Fig. 3A and B) and hMoDCs (Fig. 4A and B).These findings indicate that PGA increases the processing ofthe IL-1\ufffd proform both in vitro and ex vivo.ICE is an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves precursorforms of the proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\ufffd andIL-18 into active mature peptides (8). The resulting cleavageproducts of IL-1\ufffd and IL-18 are then available for secretion intheir active forms. ICE itself also exists as a proform (p45) and,upon activation, the proform of ICE is ultimately cleaved intotwo bioactive forms, p20 and p10 (3, 40). Because the amountof processed IL-1\ufffd increased in response to PGA, we testedwhether PGA treatment can also lead to activation of ICE.Thus, lysates from PGA-treated THP-1 cells and hMoDCswere analyzed by Western blotting. After treatment with PGA,the level of cleaved p20 subunit started to increase rapidlywithin ca. 30 to 45 min and decreased to the basal level after2 h. (Fig. 3C and D and Fig. 4C and D). These results show thatPGA leads to the activation of ICE.To confirm that ICE was required for secretion of IL-1\ufffd inPGA-treated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, we used an ICE-specific inhibitor, Z-WEHD-FMK. PGA treatment alone ledto induction of IL-1\ufffd in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after 48 h oftreatment, whereas the administration of Z-WEHD-FMKprior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1\ufffd in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E and F and Fig. 4E and F). At adose of 100 \ufffdM, Z-WEHD-FMK blocked nearly 80% of theIL-1\ufffd induced by 100 \ufffdg of PGA/ml. Taken together, withWestern blot assays, these results indicate that PGA-inducedIL-1\ufffd secretion occurs via ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1cells and hMoDCs.DISCUSSIONA PGA capsule is produced primarily by Bacillus strains butis also infrequently produced by other strains, including Staph-ylococcus epidermidis (19). In general, the biological functionof the PGA capsule in B. anthracis has been unclear except forthe role of sheltering the bacteria from phagocytosis (24). Inthe case of S. epidermidis, PGA has been reported to efficientlyshelter the bacteria from key components of the innate hostdefense (antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil phagocytosis)and from high salt concentrations, a common feature of itsnatural environment, the human skin (19). Recently, oral ad-ministration of high-molecular-mass PGA (2,000 kDa) isolatedfrom B. subtilis generated NK cell-mediated anti-tumor activityin mice bearing major histocompatibility complex class I-defi-cient tumors (18). Nanoparticles made of PGA are being de-veloped as an adjuvant for vaccines and are capable of induc-ing strong cellular and humoral immune responses (41). Theseresults suggest that PGA is able to induce an innate immuno-logical reaction in the host, and thus it may be useful as a noveladjuvant for cancer immunotherapy as well as for vaccines forinfectious diseases.The capsule of B. anthracis is produced as the high-molec-ular-mass capsule (\ufffd100 kDa) which is first polymerized onthe bacterial cell surface in vivo and then degraded to theFIG. 2. Dose-dependent cytokine induction in hMoDCs treatedwith PGA. hMoDCs were treated with various concentrations (0, 10,20, 40, 80, and 100 \ufffdg/ml) of PGA from the pXO1-cured strain of B.anthracis H9401 (A) or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (B).

Bars represent the interassaystandard deviations.VOL. 78, 2010 B. ANTHRACIS CAPSULE ACTIVATES CASPASE-1 389lower-molecular-mass capsule (\ufffd14 kDa) (25). The lower-mo-lecular-mass capsule is released from the bacterial cell surfaceinto the culture medium and is known to act as a decoy toprotect bacteria from complement (25). However, lower-mo-lecular-mass PGA was not detected in sera of infected mice,which might be either due to a failure of depolymerization ofthe high-molecular-mass form in vivo or due to fast clearancefrom serum (20). Although the production of PGA by B. an-thracis at each stage of anthrax infection is not thoroughlystudied, a high level of serum PGA reaching up to 500 to 1,000\ufffdg/ml was observed in the later stage of murine infection, inwhich actively produced virulence factors of B. anthracis stim-ulate cytokine production (20, 39). Similar levels of serumPGA were observed in rabbit and nonhuman primate modelsof pulmonary anthrax (39). In our experiment, we used PGAconcentration up to 100 \ufffdg/ml, which might be a five timeslower than the physiological concentration at the later stage ofinfection in vivo. Our experimental results strongly suggest thatthe high concentration of PGA at a later stage of infection willbe sufficient to induce IL-1\ufffd production through ICE activa-tion, which possibly contributes to the induction of septic shockin vivo.LT of B. anthracis has been reported to acts as a positiveregulator of ICE-dependent IL-1\ufffd secretion (6). However, LTalso elicits a negative effect on the production of proinflam-matory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1\ufffd and TNF-\t(1, 7, 30, 33). LT cleaves MAPKK and blocks p38 MAPK andNF-B activation, resulting in apoptosis of activated macro-phages (16, 28, 29). LT-dependent apoptosis is also associatedwith the activation of various caspases, including ICE (6, 33).Selective apoptosis of activated macrophages by LT preventssecretion of cytokines and chemokines that alert the remainderof the immune system (28). Thus, anthrax infection can pro-ceed undetected to the terminal stage. These findings indicatethat LT is involved both in the induction and in the preventionof proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion throughICE activation and in the apoptosis of activated macrophages(42). Similarly, the activation of ICE is subject to both theproinflammatory and the proapoptotic pathways in the anthraxinfection (33). The balance among these processes might beimportant for the progression of the anthrax infection. Ourresults show that PGA also functions as an important virulencefactor for anthrax infection by activating ICE. In addition,PGA might also affect MAPK or other signaling pathways andcould thus potentially contribute to the expression of IL-1\ufffdand/or other cytokines. This possibility as well as the role ofPGA in the apoptosis of APCs, including activated macro-phages, is currently under investigation.Because IL-1\ufffd is one of the key host modulators of septicshock (6), regulation of ICE activation by both anthrax LT andPGA at the late stage of infection can be considered as apotential target for therapeutic intervention. Actually, al-though anthrax spore-induced ICE-mediated IL-1\ufffd produc-tion at early stage of infection is required for host defenseFIG. 3. Processing of IL-1\ufffd, activation of ICE, and dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1\ufffd production by an ICE inhibitor in PGA-treated THP-1cells. Cultures of THP-1 cells were treated with a fixed dose of PGA (100 \ufffdg/ml) from the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 (A and C)or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (B and D) for increasing periods as indicated. Protein lysates generated from these cultures were analyzedby Western blotting (50 \ufffdg of total protein per lane) for the presence of cleaved IL-1\ufffd (17 kDa) (A and B, upper panels), the activated cleavageproduct of ICE, p20 (C and D, upper panels), and \ufffd-actin (A, B, C, and D, lower panels). Shown are the results of one representative experimentfrom three separate experiments. For the inhibitor experiments, cultures of THP-1 cells were pretreated with or without increasing concentrationsof Z-WEHD-FMK. After 30 min of pretreatment, cultures were treated with or without 100 \ufffdg of PGA/ml from the pXO1-cured strain of B.anthracis H9401 (E) or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (F) for 48 h. Values represent the average extracellular cytokine concentrations of IL-1\ufffdmeasured in triplicate by ELISA. Bars indicate the interassay standard deviations.390 CHO ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.against B. anthracis infection (17), LT-induced IL-1\ufffd produc-tion has been reported to account for lethality of B. anthracisinfection (32). ICE inhibitors have already been proposed as apotential therapeutic agent for anthrax infection (33). In ad-dition to IL-1\ufffd, IL-18 (which is also activated by ICE) is an-other potential target for therapy of an anthrax infection. Inour study, the induction of IL-18 secretion by PGA was not,however, observed. Usually, THP-1 cells are likely to expresslow levels of pro-IL-18 without lipopolysaccharide priming,similar to human monocytes and peripheral blood mononu-clear cells (21, 26, 34). In our experiment, it was difficult todetect the level of IL-18 induced by PGA both in differentiatedTHP-1 cells and in hMoDCs. The potential of an ICE inhibitoras a target for therapy requires confirmation in vivo usinganimal models through the examination of the host response toanthrax PGA (and/or LT) and to live anthrax spore infection inICE\ufffd/\ufffd compared to wild-type mice.Our study is the first to show that PGA produced by B.anthracis infection is capable of inducing IL-1\ufffd productionthrough activation of ICE both in vitro using THP-1 cells andex vivo with hMoDCs. Similarly, the treatment of humanCD14\ufffd monocytes with PGA also increased the production ofIL-1\ufffd with ICE activation (data not shown). A complete un-derstanding of how PGA of B. anthracis with or without LTinteracts with host against infection at each stage of infectionmay lead to novel therapeutic strategies to improve the effi-ciency of the immune response to anthrax infection.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank S.

After 30 min of pretreatment, cultures were treated with or without 100 \ufffdg of PGA/ml from the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401(E) or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (F) for 48 h. Values represent the average extracellular cytokine concentrations of IL-1\ufffd measured intriplicate by ELISA. Bars indicate the interassay standard deviations.VOL. 78, 2010 B.
