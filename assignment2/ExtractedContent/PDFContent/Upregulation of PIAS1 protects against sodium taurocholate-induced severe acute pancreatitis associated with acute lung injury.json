Yuan).The regulator of cytokine signaling known as protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS1) is increasinglyunderstood to have diverse regulatory functions for inflammation, but its effect in inflammatory condi-tions such as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has not previously been reported. The aim of this study wasto investigate the effect of upregulation of PIAS1 on SAP associated with acute lung injury (ALI), and itssubsequent effect on disease severity. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were given an IV injection of adenovirusserotype 5 (Ad5)/F35-PIAS1, Ad5/F35-vector or saline before induction of SAP. The control group receivedonly a sham operation. Lung and pancreas samples were harvested 16 h after induction. The protein lev-els of PIAS1 in tissue were investigated. The severity of pancreatic injury was determined by a histologicalscore of pancreatic injury, serum amylase, and pancreatic water content. The lung injury was evaluatedby measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability, lung myeloperoxidase activity and malondi-aldehyde levels. The survival rates of rats were also analyzed. The results found that in Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated rats, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 levels were decreasedbut showed no influence on the levels of IL-10, and the severity of pancreatic tissue injury was lesscompared with either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The administration ofAd5/F35-PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats downregulated the activity of the signal transducer and activatorof transcription-1 (STAT1) pathway and the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) andintercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 protein in lung. Thus, compared with the untreated SAP rats,the inflammatory response and the severity of ALI decreased, and the survival rates increased(P < 0.01). These findings suggest that PIAS1 could augment anti-inflammatory activity by inhibitingSTAT1, thus attenuating the severity of SAP associated with ALI.\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It carries anoverall mortality rate of 10\u201315% [1], but the rate approaches 30\u201340% for especially severe cases [2]. Deaths associated with severeacute pancreatitis (SAP) are mainly due to its major complication,the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (for-merly known as multiple organ failure). Acute lung injury (ALI) isa major component of this complication, clinically manifested asacute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. Despite significant ad-vances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALI in SAP and itsmanagement, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high.Studies have shown that pancreatic damage due to SAP leads tothe release of systemic inflammatory cytokines, including tumorll rights reserved.. Chen), sap19760714@sina.n), yuanyz28@yahoo.com.cnnecrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b. These cytokinesmay result in distant organ damage and the development of ALI.They therefore play a key role in the pathogenesis of SAP withALI, and are ultimately responsible for the majority of deaths asso-ciated with this condition [4]. Related studies found that the tran-scriptional induction of genes involved in the release ofinflammatory cytokines associated with SAP is controlled by vari-ous regulated factors, including the Janus kinase/signal transducerand activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway [5].A family of negative regulators of the JAK/STAT signaling path-way is that of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), withfour members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy. Gene activationanalyzes show that PIAS1 selectively regulates a subset of STAT1-dependent genes, with a notable preference for inflammatoryresponse [6]. Related studies found that PIAS1-null mice demon-strated a hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide-induced septicshock, and others indicate that PIAS1 is involved into in responseto inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-a and lipopolysaccharide [7].PIAS1 participates in anti-inflammatory responses by regulatingthe transcription factor, nuclear factor-j-light-chain-enhancer ofhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.02.016mailto:chenping714@yahoo.com.cnmailto:sap19760714@sina. commailto:sap19760714@sina. commailto:chenping714@medmail.com.cnmailto:yuanyz28@yahoo.com.cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.02.016http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666306 P. Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314activated B cells. This transcription factor is involved in the induc-tion of approximately 200 genes, many of which are involved ininflammatory responses [8\u201310]. In addition, PIAS1 has also beensuggested to promote the sumoylation of the transcription factorperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c, resulting in thetrans-repression of inflammatory gene activation [11]. These find-ings support a hypothesis that a focus on the regulation of PIAS1might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflam-matory disorders. However, past studies have not fully addressedwhether the administration of PIAS1 would prove equally effica-cious if administered upon the onset of SAP. As well, the precisemechanisms determining the effect of PIAS1 on SAP relative tothe degree of lung injury are largely unknown.The purpose of this study was to elucidate the up-regulating ef-fect of PIAS1 on SAP associated with ALI. We performed a series ofstudies to explore for a new therapeutic agent for SAP, includingtotal water content, scoring of lung injury, neutrophil count inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung tissue myeloperoxidase(MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammatorymediators levels, and a survival analysis of rats with SAP.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and reagentsThe male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, 150\u2013200 g, obtained from theanimal experimental department of Ruijin Hospital were randomlydivided into the following groups.In the SAP group (n = 20), 24 h prior to the start of the experi-ments the rats were deprived of food but allowed access to water.The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pento-barbital (30%, 0.15 mL/100 g). SAP was induced by retrograde infu-sion of 3.5% sodium taurocholate (1.5 mL/kg, Sigma\u2013Aldrich,St. Louis, MO, USA) into the pancreatic duct transduodenally for2\u20133 min via a 24-gauge angiocath using a constant infusion rateof 100 lL/min under laparotomy. The abdominal wounds wereclosed and the rats returned to their cages with free access to waterand food after surgery.In treated groups, we used replication-defective adenovirus sero-type 5/F35 (Ad5/F35) as the vector. Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was constructedby Benyuanzhengyang Bio. (Shanghai, China) using the previouslydescribed method [12]. PIAS1 cDNA, containing the full-lengthtranslated regions, were sub-cloned into the PDC316-MCMV-EGFPtransfer plasmid. This plasmid was cotransfected into 293 cells,along with a fragment of the plasmid containing the Ad5/F35 aden-oviral vector. Additionally, an Ad5/F35 containing an empty expres-sion cassette was constructed for use as a control (Ad5/F35-vector).All of the viral constructs were similar with the exception of thetransgene, and the production and purification procedures wereidentical. The dosage of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was basedon our previous studies\u2019 results (Un-published data). Ad5/F35-PIAS1or Ad5/F35-vector (3.6 \ufffd 108 PFU/100 g in 25 lL sterile PBS) wasdelivered by IV injection through the penile vein in rats at 10 min,on day 1, or on day 2 prior to SAP induction (n = 10, 10 and 10, respec-tively for each treatment). For these treatment groups, SAP was in-duced with 3.5% sodium taurocholate as described above. Based onthe results of PIAS1 protein expression levels, on day 2 before SAPinduction, rats who had received the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-vector treatment were selected for future study.In the control group (n = 10), rats were given only a sham oper-ation, consisting of administration of an equal volume of PBS (withno SAP induction, Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-vector treatment).Blood samples, pancreatic and lung tissues were harvested at16 h after the onset of induction according to our previousmethods [13]. The serum was separated from blood by a 1600g,10 min centrifugation for examination. The experiments wereconducted according to the Guidelines of the Shanghai AnimalUse and Care Committee and the National Animal Welfare Law.2.2. Morphological examinationPancreatic and lung tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalde-hyde overnight and subsequently dehydrated through a gradedethanol series. After impregnation in paraffin wax, tissue sampleswere cut into blocks (4 lm). Pancreatic and lung tissues werestained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) and examined by lightmicroscopy. Sections were examined by an experienced morphol-ogist, who was blinded to the sample identity, for tissue injury.For this study, five randomly chosen microscopic fields were exam-ined for each tissue sample and given a histological score for injuryaccording to the previously described method [14,15].2.3. Wet/dry weight ratio of pancreatic or lung tissuePancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue watercontent. A portion of the pancreatic or lung tissue was taken imme-diately after sacrifice, to trim fat and weigh. Tissue water contentwas determined by calculating the wet weight/dry weight ratioaccording to the formula: [(wet weight \ufffd dry weight)/dryweight] \ufffd 100%, where the wet weight was the initial weight ofthe respective tissue and the weight after incubation at 72 \ufffdC for24 h was the dry weight.2.4. Biochemical assaysSerum amylase level was determined by a Beckman CX7 Chem-istry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum TNF-a,IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were evaluated by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA kit, Mai Bio, Shanghai, China).2.5. Lung tissue MPO and MDA assaysTo carry out the assays, 1 g lung tissue samples were thawed,homogenized in 1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,000g for10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The supernatant was assayed for MPO activityand MDA concentration with test kits (Jianchen Bio, Nanjing,China). All procedures were done in accordance with the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions.2.6. Neutrophil counting in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and amedian sternotomy allowed for exposure of both lungs. The tracheawas exposed and inserted with an IV infusion needle. After ligatingthe hilum of the right lung, the left lung was lavaged five times with1 mL ice-cold PBS. The recovery ratio of the fluid was about 90%. TheBALF was then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min to separate cellsfrom the supernatant. Cells were suspended in saline and the num-ber of neutrophils was counted with a hemocytometer.2.7. Western blot assayTissue samples were washed twice with PBS, homogenized witha tissue homogenizer in RIPA buffer (Biyuntian Shanghai, China),and centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 \ufffdC for 10 min. The supernatantswere collected and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC. Protein concentration of eachsample was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay(Biyuntian, Shanghai, China). Each sample was adjusted up to thedesired protein content of 40 lg, denatured in loading buffer(62 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),0.003% bromophenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on aP.

The separatedproteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membraneby using transfer buffer (39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris pH 8.3, 20%methanol) at 200 mA for 90 min. The membranes were blockedwith 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-0.1% Tweenfor 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min in TBS-0.1% Tween. They were then incubated with a primary antibody,either STAT1, phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1; Cell SignalingBiotechnology, Danvers, MA, USA, diluted to 1:1000), PIAS1, intra-cellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, or matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA, di-luted to 1:500), each in TBS-0.1% Tween, overnight at 4 \ufffdC.

The results showed that in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated rats, there was remarkable positive staining for PIAS1 inendothelial cells of lung and pancreatic acinar cells. However,PIAS1 was weakly expressed in control rats, and there was noremarkable PIAS1 staining in either the untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (Fig. 1B and C).3.2. Histological changes of pancreatic and lung tissueLung tissue from control rats showed a normal structure and nohistopathological changes under a light microscope. In untreatedSAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the lung tissue stained withH&E indicated a widespread increase in alveolar wall thicknesscaused by edema, severe hemorrhage in the alveolus, alveolus col-lapse and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration. In the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats, the histopathological changes of lung tissuewere minor compared with those in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, especially for hemorrhage in the alveolus(Fig. 2A). The infiltration of neutropils and mononuclear cells,interstitial edema and focal necrotic areas were seen in the pancre-atic tissue of both untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats.The morphological changes in pancreatic tissue of Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated rats included intralobular edema, inflammatory infiltrate,and acinar cell necrosis, but these were greatly reduced (character-ized only by slightly interstitial edema), and without obviousparenchyma necrosis and hemorrhage. There were no observablepancreatitis pathologic changes in control rats (Fig. 2B).The severity of pancreatic injury in rats based on histologicalscore of pancreatic injury, the ratio of wet /dry weight of pancreatictissue and serum amylase levels, are summarized in Table 1. Theresults showed that the levels of these markers for inflammationwere significantly lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats as com-pared to those of the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treatedrats (P < 0.01). However, the histological score of pancreatic injuryand serum amylase levels in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats werehigher than for the control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of theabove-mentioned markers showed no statistically significant dif-ference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treatedrats (P > 0.05).The tests for levels of severity of lung injury in rats, includingthe histological score of lung injury and the ratio of wet/dry weightof lung tissue, are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the controlrats, the histological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dryweight of lung were significantly increased in both the untreatedSAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The increase in his-tological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dry weight of lungwas significantly reduced in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats(P < 0.01) compared to either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vectortreated rats, although still higher than in the control rats(P < 0.01). The levels of the above-mentioned markers showed nostatistical difference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P > 0.05).3.3. Detection of inflammatory response of lungThe MPO activity and concentrations of MDA in the lung wereincreased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated ratscompared to that of the controls rats (P < 0.01, respectively), butthere was no significant different between the SAP and Ad5/F35-Fig. 3.

However, in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treatedrats, the upregulation of PIAS1 protein markedly decreased theMPO activity and MDA concentration (vs. the untreated SAP andAd5/F35-vector treated rats, P < 0.01; vs. the control rats, P > 0.05,respectively). The number of neutrophils in BALF showed increasesin rats who received the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treat-ment, as compared with that seen in the lungs of Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated and control rats (P < 0.01). There were no significant differ-ence between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats(P > 0.05) (Table 3).3.4. Comparison of serum TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levelsThe TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6 serum levels were significantly de-creased in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats in comparison with thoseof SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01), and there wasno difference between the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated and control rats(P > 0.05). In addition, the serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6showed no significant difference between the untreated SAP andAd5/F35-vector treated rats (P > 0.05). Anti-inflammatory cytokineIL-10 levels were greatly deceased in untreated SAP rats comparedto control rats (P < 0.01), and were also lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 orAd5/F35-vector treated rats than control rats (P < 0.01, respec-tively). There was no difference in IL-10 levels in Ad5/F35-PIAS1or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats compared to that of untreated SAPrats (P > 0.05) (Table 4).3.5. Pulmonary expression of inflammatory-regulated mediatorsWestern blot analysis of inflammatory-regulated mediators isshown in Fig. 3. To gain direct evidence for the mechanism leadingto the reduction of the inflammatory response of lung induced byPIAS1 in rat with SAP, we determined the levels of un-phosphory-lated and phosphorylated STAT1 protein in lung tissue. The phos-phorylation of STAT1 protein (as assayed with P-STAT 1antibody) in the lungs of untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector trea-ted rats was enhanced compared to that of control rats (P < 0.01).In contrast, the treatment of SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 led tothe abrogation of phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (P < 0.01,compared to untreated SAP and Ad/F35-vector treated rats), thereFig. 4.

Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314was no difference in this regard when compared with the controlrats (P > 0.05). However, the un-P-STAT1 protein levels (as assayedwith STAT 1 antibody) for all SAP-induced rats were highercompared to that of control rats (P < 0.01). ICAM-1 protein expres-sion in the lung revealed that its 85-kDa protein expression levelswere increased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treatedrats, compared with either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated or controlrats (P < 0.01). Moreover, the increase of MMP-9 protein expressionin lung was much more marked in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats compared to that of the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treatedand control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 pro-teins showed no difference between either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated and control rats or between the Ad5/F35-vector treatedand untreated SAP rats (P > 0.05).3.6. Survival studyThe average survival time of SAP-induced rats receiving Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was 31.70 \u00b1 5.16 h (95% confidence interval (CI):21.47\u201341.82). The average survival time of SAP-induced ratsreceiving Ad5/F35-vector was 19.80 \u00b1 4.17 h (95% CI: 11.62\u201327.97). As for the untreated SAP rats, the average survival timewas 18.70 \u00b1 4.19 h (95% CI: 10.48\u201326.91). The 48 h survival ratewas significantly improved in SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treat-ment compared with the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vectortreated rats (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference wasseen in the survival rate between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (Fig. 4).4. DiscussionThe use of Ad5-based gene therapy offers several significantadvantages over the administration of recombinant proteins. Forexample, the pretreatment of mice with Ad5 delivery-IL-10 re-duced weight loss, attenuated the release of inflammatory cyto-kines, and reduced mortality in mice with sepsis; pretreatmentwith a control Ad5 delivery did not significantly exacerbate theinflammatory response. The results suggest that the injection ofAd5 delivery-IL-10 could reduce the severity of sepsis in rats[16]. Therefore, the gene transfer has been proposed as a novelmethod to produce cytokine inhibitors or antagonists in inflamma-tion, in the present study the delivery of adenovirus-based genewas used for the severe inflammatory disease SAP to explore its ef-fect of action.Expression with Ad5 vectors is rapid, with appearance of theprotein usually occurring within hours; peak expression occurswithin 1\u20133 days after Ad5 instillation [16]. Some studies were per-formed in which the Ad5-delivered gene therapy was administeredbefore the onset of the inflammatory state [17,18]. Recently, a hy-brid Ad5 vector was developed, in which the fiber protein fromAd35 was substituted for the original fiber. This vector binds in aCoxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent man-ner, and has successfully been used to infect suspension cells. Andthe ability of Ad5/F35 to deliver transgenes to cells with highefficiency and low toxicity provides an improved means of study-ing the consequences of transient gene expression in cells [19].This study explored the effect of using Ad5/F35-based genetherapy to deliver PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats. Firstly, the time toadministrate Ad5/F35-PIAS1 seems to be very important, since ittakes time to transfect and express protein. The route and timecourse of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was based on previousstudies that have also been shown that cytokine production afterthe administration of Ad5-cytokine gene persists for 4 days [20].According to the results of PIAS1 protein expression, the currentstudy demonstrates that Ad5/F35 transfer of PIAS1 is an effectivemethod to transfect the pancreas and lung for up to 3 days in ratswhen delivered by IV injection. The expression of PIAS1 protein inlung and pancreatic tissue was greatly increased in rats who weretreated with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 before SAP induction com-pared to those treated 10 min or 1 day prior to SAP induction.Therefore, the rats received with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 beforeSAP induction was used for future investigation. And these findingsrepresent the first demonstration of prophylactic strategy of Ad5/F35 gene transfer in experimental SAP. Secondly, the early inter-vention is necessary in the treatment of SAP, since SAP developsfast and the consequent systemic responses will increase mortality,thus making therapies more difficult and more costly. Here, wepresented the first evidence that early prophylactic administrationof Ad5F35-PIAS1 could ameliorate the extent of injury of pancre-atic tissue in SAP-induced rats and decrease mortality. Thirdly,the administration of the Ad5F35-vector had no effect on the injuryP. Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314 313extent of pancreatic tissue in SAP-induced rats. Finally, because ofthe results mentioned above, it was necessary to further evaluatethe effective mechanisms of up-regulation of PIAS1 on SAP-in-duced rats associated with ALI.ALI is an important problem affecting the severity of SAP [21]. Itis believed that the excess production of inflammatory mediatorsreleased by macrophages, neutrophils and other cells of the im-mune system in a cascade network is the underlying mechanismcausing ALI in SAP [22,23]. As SAP progresses, neutrophils are alsotransmigrated across endothelial surfaces and into the tissues byinflammatory mediator induction, where they exert their toxic ef-fects, resulting in microvascular dysfunction and local inflamma-tory response. These responses include microvascular disorder,alveolar capillary barrier leakage, interstitial and alveolar edema,and eventual cell death [24,25].The wet weigh/dry weight ratios of lung tissue for each groupwere measured for assessment of changes in lung vascular perme-ability. This study found that the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated ratsshowed a much lower ratio of wet to dry weight in lungs than inthe untreated SAP rats. Furthermore, when compared to the un-treated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the Ad5/F35-PIAS1treated rats had lower scores for lung injury, including measure-ments of alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggrega-tion of neutrophils in airspace or vessel wall, and thickness of thealveolar wall. According to the MPO assay measurement of neutro-phil accumulation, and the BALF count of neutrophils, the un-treated SAP rats had a higher neutrophil accumulation thaneither the control or Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats. MDA is one ofthe final products of lipid peroxidation, and its concentration is di-rectly proportional to the cell damage caused by reactive oxygenmetabolites [26]. In the present study, the increase in pulmonaryMDA production following SAP induction was reduced by Ad5/F35-PIAS1 prophylactic administration, suggesting that Ad5/F35-PIAS1 is involved in an anti-inflammatory effect. These results lendsupport to the use of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 as an anti-inflammatory ther-apy for SAP associated with ALI.The STAT1 signaling pathway, one of the most important intra-cellular signaling pathways in mammals, is involved in the regula-tion of the inflammatory response. Various forms of stimuli canactivate it and thereafter the phosphorylation of STAT1 regulatesa variety of downstream proteins. Many studies have shown thatSTAT1 regulates the transcription of cytokine genes [27]. Ourprevious studies found that there was a positive interaction be-tween the activity of STAT1, which regulates the expression ofinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6, and theseverity of SAP. The inhibitor of STAT1 (Rapamycin) decreasedthe levels of these inflammatory cytokines, thus lessening theseverity of SAP (Un-published data).Meanwhile, TNF-a and IL-1b are important inflammatory cyto-kines participating in the pathogenesis of SAP, directly injuringcells and causing necrosis, inflammation and edema [28]. IL-6 isa multifunctional cytokine released by macrophages and is anaccurate early predictor of acute pancreatitis severity, with a sen-sitivity range of 89\u2013100% [29]. The current study found that theearly administration of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 might block the inductionof TNF-a and IL-1b. Previous study has also shown that IL-10 isan important anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a role as aself-defense mechanism, limiting the intensity of the inflammatoryprocess. Several studies concluded that IL-10 plays an importantprotective role for pancreatic cell injury in SAP [30], but Ad5/F35-PIAS1 gene prophylactic administration had no significantinfluence on the release of IL-10 in the course SAP in this study.As secondary chemotactic factors of inflammatory-regulatedmediators, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 initiate a cascade reaction, accumu-late neutrophilic leukocytes and stimulate the production of reac-tive oxygen species and other pro-inflammatory factors, attackand degrade membranes, damage membrane stability and causeslung vascular permeability [31\u201333]. In our experiments, the ele-vated levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 were found in SAP. The Ad5/F35-vector were administered IV have no significantly promotionin lung inflammation were observed in this study. Furthermore,the pretreatment of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was able to inhibit the activa-tion of STAT1, down-regulated the levels of downstream inflamma-tory-regulated mediators including ICAM-1 and MMP-9. As thesemediators are known mediators of inflammatory injury, the reduc-tion in their levels may be important in attenuating the endothelialpermeability of lung tissue and lessening the severity of ALI of SAP.These findings suggest that pretreatment with Ad5/F35-based genetherapy expressing PIAS1 can be safely performed during acuteinflammation and can reduce the magnitude of the subsequentinflammatory process. As a final result, the survival time was pro-longed in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats compared with SAP rats.In our study, the results suggest that the prophylactic adminis-tration of PIAS1 inhibited the activation of STAT1 and down-regulated downstream inflammatory cytokines, relieved endothe-lial permeability, attenuated ALI and increased the survival ratein SAP-induced rats. PIAS1 also inhibited the inflammation andlessened the pancreatic injury of SAP. It might be helpful to usePIAS1 in SAP as a therapeutic strategy for the future experimentand we believe this study will be particularly relevant to clinicalsettings.References[1] Yousaf M, McCallion K, Diamond T.
