Its up-regulation might play a role in the tumourigenesis of invasivetumours, but its involvement in human lung cancer tissues has not yet been determined.We immunohistochemically compared FAK expression and localisation in 60 formalin-fixedand paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues with that in the surroundingnon-neoplastic tissue and in a further five microscopically normal lungs. FAK mRNA levels werequantitatively determined by real-time RT-PCR in frozen tissue specimens of all of the tumoursand 21 matched non-neoplastic lung parenchymas, and protein expression in 16 homogenatesof the matched neoplastic/non-neoplastic specimens was evaluated by Western blotting.The three different techniques showed that FAK is weakly expressed in non-neoplastic lungparenchyma and up-regulated in NSCLCs. Moreover, Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR indi-cated a statistically significant correlation between FAK up-regulation and higher disease stages(I + II versus III + IV, p = 0.019 andup-regulated in NSCLCs, and sug\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introductionnumber of factors regulate tumour cell growth, migrationnd proliferation, and a major role is played by interac-ions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1]. Integrins areell membrane-spanning proteins that bind to the ECM andontribute to the assembly of the cellular focal adhesionites in which focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is located. FAKs a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein that was origi-ally detected in Rous sarcoma virus (v-src)-transformedhicken embryo fibroblasts [2]. A primary autophosphory-ation site (Tyr397) is located in the N-terminal region ofAK and directs the interaction with the Src homology-2omain [3]. Two highly conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr576nd Tyr577) are part of the central catalytic domain that isnvolved in signalling events to downstream effectors [4],nd multiple protein\u2014protein interaction sites are presentn the C-terminal region [5]. FAK is a point of convergence forhe signalling events mediated by both integrins and growthactor receptors [6] that regulate processes, such as celldhesion [5], motility [7], migration [8], and apoptosis [9].FAK phosphorylation leads to the activation of variousownstream intracellular signalling molecules such as Srcamily kinases [10], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [11], phos-holipase C [12] and Grb7 [13]. As all of these effectorsctivate pathways that are intimately involved in neoplasticransformation, invasion and metastases, FAK may play anmportant role in tumourigenesis [14], a hypothesis that isupported by the original isolation of the human FAK generom a primary human sarcoma [15] and the high FAK lev-ls found in several tumour cell lines of different origin [16].AK is also up-regulated in different primary human tumoursncluding breast, colorectal [17], prostate [18], thyroid [19],varian [20], and brain tumours [21]. The extent of its mRNAxpression has been linked to the progression of epithe-ial and mesenchymal tumours to invasive and metastatichenotypes [22], and to poor prognoses in patients with hep-tocellular carcinoma [23] and acute myeloid leukemia [24].inally, at cell level, FAK regulates matrix metalloproteinasexpression and secretion, and EGF-stimulated chemotaxisotility [14].The FAK signal transduction pathway may be a promisingarget for cancer therapy [14]. It has recently been shownhat inhibiting FAK expression and activation by inducingAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) increases the sensitivity ofransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracil,hich suggests that FAK may play a role in tumour chemore-istance [25]. The same has been found in pancreatic ade-ocarcinoma cells, in which the suppression of FAK expres-ion by means of mRNA interference enhances gemcitabine-nduced in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, and increasesumour susceptibility to chemotherapy [26]. Moreover, thectivation of FAK and its molecular partners improves cellesistance to ionizing radiation in lung adenocarcinoma cells27]. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death inestern countries: its incidence continues to increase [28]nd it has a poor prognosis as only 15% of affected subjectsurvive for 5 years or more after diagnosis [29]. However,espite the increasing importance of FAK in human cancer,here is still a lack of data concerning FAK expression in pri-ary human NSCLCs. The aim of this study was to investigatehe expression and clinical significance of FAK in 60 surgicallyL\ufffdSoiS. Carelli et al.esected stage I\u2014IV NSCLCs with known clinicopathologicaleatures.. Materials and methods.1. Patients and sampleshe study population consisted of 60 NSCLC patients whonderwent curative surgical resection, without having pre-iously received chemotherapy or radiation therapy; all ofhe enrolled patients have their informed consent to thetudy.Tissue samples representative of the tumour, non-eoplastic lung parenchyma (normal tissue sections andeactive lung parenchyma adjacent to carcinomas) and fiveicroscopically normal lung specimens were routinely fixedn 10% buffered neutral formalin, and processed for conven-ional histopathological examination. Immediately adjacenteoplastic specimens and 21 macroscopically non-neoplasticissue samples (taken as far as possible from the neoplasticrea) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min ofurgical resection, and standard 5 \ufffdm thick sections fromaraffin-embedded blocks were stained with hematoxylinnd eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Tumour his-otype and stage were, respectively, determined accordingo the WHO classification of lung and pleural tumours (1999)nd the TNM staging system (1997). All of the non-neoplasticamples were microscopically judged to be benign.The clinical follow-up of 43 patients was available for aean post-surgical period of 28 months (range: 12\u201445); theollow-up data were obtained by means of direct patientontact at 2-month intervals for the first 2 years and 4-onth intervals thereafter. At the time of the last follow-up,3 patients had died for cancer-related causes. The clinico-athological characteristics of the study patients are shownn Table 1..2. Tissue homogenisation and proteinuantificationresh frozen lung tissues were homogenised under iso-onic condition (25 mM Tris\u2014HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose,% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% NP-40 (v/v), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mMGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, 1 mM aprotinin,mM leupeptin, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodiumoride) using an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 homogeniser (IKA-abortechnik GmbH, Staufen, Germany). The homogenatesere centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 20 min at 4 \u25e6C, after whichhe supernatants were collected and their protein concen-ration determined by means of Lowry Ciocalteau\u2019s methodsing bovine serum albumin as standard..3.

FAK activation was investigated using theFAK pY Sampler Pack (Biosource, Camarillo, CA), whichcontains polyclonal antibodies recognising phosphorylatedtyrosines (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861); FAK phos-phorylation was normalised to its expression levels. Theproteins were visualised by means of an enhanced chemilu-minescence detection system (ECLTM, Amersham, ArlingtonHeights, IL). After being acquired using a GelDocTM imagecapture system (Biorad), the autoradiograms were quanti-fied using Quantity OneTM software.2.4.

Briefly, the slidesere dewaxed, rehydrated and processed using an Opti-ax Plus automated immunostainer (BioGenex, San Ramon,A). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3%ydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 10 min and, afterxtensive washing in TBS/Triton X-100, the slides were incu-ated with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution) overnightt 4 \u25e6C; 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogenicubstrate.

Real-time RT-PCRAK mRNA levels were quantified by real-time quantita-ive RT-PCR based on TaqManTM technology, using the ABIRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosys-ems, Foster City, CA) as previously described [30]. Themount of FAK mRNA was normalised to an endogenous ref-rence (\ufffd-actin, ACTB) and expressed as n-fold FAK mRNAevels in relation to a calibrator or 1\u00d7 sample (MCF7 celline).

Results.1. FAK Western blottingestern blotting was used to evaluate p125FAK proteinxpression in 16 NSCLCs (six stage I, six stage II, four stage III)Table 1) and paired non-neoplastic lung parenchymas. FAKxpression was significantly increased in 13 NSCLC samplesn comparison with their non-neoplastic counterparts. Theestern blotting of seven samples is shown in Fig. 1(panel); the ratio between the optical density of the neoplas-ic (T) and non-neoplastic (N) tissues (OD T/N) of the sameatients was calculated and expressed graphically (Fig. 1,anel B). The increased expression of FAK in the NSCLCss documented by the mean ratio of 2.98 (range 0\u20147.3),nd comparable results were obtained using a polyclonalntibody specific for the FAK N-terminal portion (data nothown). FAK activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphoryla-ion [32], and so the phosphorylation status of FAK tyrosineesidues measured by specific antibodies can be consideredn index of protein activation.

These results suggest that the up-regulation ofFAK expression does not correlate with increased activationin NSCLCs.3.2. Tissue localisation of FAK byimmunohistochemistryFAK immunoreactivity was detected in both normal and neo-plastic lung cells. In normal bronchus, FAK protein expressionwas detected in epithelial ciliated and basal cells, chon-drocytes, and the ductal and serous cells of the submu-cosal glands; FAK immunostaining was also detected in theendothelial cells of the vessels within the lung parenchyma.Immunoreactivity was greater in reactive lesions, such assquamous metaplastic bronchial epithelium, and in thehyperplastic/reactive pneumocytes surrounding the neo-plasia. Fig. 2 shows FAK protein immunodetection in non-neoplastic lung parenchyma.In comparison with the non-neoplastic lung parenchy-mas, FAK was overexpressed in every neoplastic tissuesection. Furthermore, FAK immunoreactivity was strongerin the NSCLCs than in previously described reactive lunglesions, with moderate-strong immunoreactivity in between40% and more than 90% of tumour cells. Forty-six ofthe NSCLCs (77%) were HE (moderate-intense immunore-activity in more than 70% neoplastic cells; scores 6and 9), 10 (17%) were IE (moderate immunoreactivity in40\u201470% of neoplastic cells; score 4), and 4 (7%) were LE(moderate-intense immunoreactivity in less than 40% neo-plastic cells; scores 2 and 3). FAK was also observed inthe endothelial cells of the vessels within the neoplasticstroma.Furthermore, as shown in Table 2, there was no sig-nificant difference in FAK immunostaining between thetwo most represented tumour histotypes (ADK versus SQ,p = 0.947, \ufffd2-test).

Quantitative evaluation of FAK mRNA byreal-time RT-PCRFAK mRNA levels were investigated in 60 NSCLCs and 21matched non-neoplastic lung tissues (16 of these matchedsamples were also studied by Western blotting, see Fig. 1).The non-neoplastic lung samples were used to establish thebasal levels of FAK mRNA, and FAK transcripts ranging from0.5n to 3.3n (mean 1.3n; median 1.1n) were determined inall of them. Three tumour samples were discarded becauseof RNA degradation, but FAK mRNA was assayed in all ofthe remaining 57 and ranged from 0.5n to 4.5n (mean 1.8n;median 1.5n). Both Wilcoxon\u2019s test and the t-test showedthat FAK mRNA levels were significantly higher in the NSCLCswhether all of the samples were considered (p = 0.016 and0.013) (Fig. 4), or just the 21 matched neoplastic and non-neoplastic lung samples (p = 0.038 and 0.04).3.4.

Expression of \ufffd1-integrin and p53 in NSCLCshe correlations between FAK up-regulation and changes inther adhesion- and apoptosis-related proteins were evalu-ted by Western blotting in 12 of the above samples. Thexpression of \ufffd1-integrin was comparable in the neoplasticnd non-neoplastic lung tissues (p = 0.13, t-test), as can beeen in the example of Western blotting and densitomet-ic analysis of all of the examined cases in Fig. 5 (panel). The up-regulation of FAK therefore seems to be spe-ific among adhesion-related molecules. We also assessedhe pro-apoptotic p53 protein, which is capable of suppress-ng FAK expression [31], and found that the increased FAKxpression in NSCLCs did not correspond to changes in p53xpression in any of the 12 cases (p = 0.3, t-test) (Fig. 5,anel B).. DiscussionAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell motility7], migration [8], apoptosis [9] and cell matrix interac-ions [6]. All of these processes are crucial for neoplasticransformation, invasion and dissemination, and suggest aotential role of FAK in the development and progressionf cancer [14]. FAK is overexpressed in a variety of humanumours including breast [17], colorectal [17,33], prostate18,34], thyroid [19], ovarian [20], endometrial [35], andrain cancers [21]. Agents aimed at inhibiting the FAK signalransduction pathway may be useful in the development offfective new anticancer therapies [14,36]. Inhibited FAKFig. 3 FAK protein overexpression in NSCLCs as detected by immmous cell carcinoma. Original magnification: (A) \u00d7600 and (B) \u00d74immunostaining. Considering all of the FAK protein expres-sion values, Western blotting showed a statistically signif-icant correlation between higher protein levels and a hightumour stage (stage I + II versus stage III + IV, p = 0.019). TheFAK mRNA overexpression revealed by real-time RT-PCR notonly correlated with a high tumour stage (stage I + II ver-sus stage III + IV, p = 0.028), but there was also a statisticallysignificant association between FAK mRNA level and tumoursize (T1 versus T2, T3 and T4, p = 0.046).The association between FAK mRNA measured by real-time RT-PCR and the presence of node metastases at thetime of resection was also observed. The 21 matched spec-imens were analysed separately and sub-classified on thectivity or modulated FAK expression have recently beenssociated with the decreased resistance of human pan-reatic adenocarcinoma cells to acquired apoptosis withetachment from the ECM [37], the increased sensitivity ofransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracilFAK in lung cancer 269Fig. 5 FAK regulation in NSCLCs. \ufffd1-integrin (A) and p53 (B) expression in matched neoplastic (T) and non-neoplastic homogenateshowns areE. ofcmnbtTtoibpcrocamttsasiapsctp(N) of 12 NSCLC patients.

Mean values \u00b1 S.[30], and enhanced gemcitabine-induced in vitro and in vivocytotoxicity [26].This paper describes FAK expression in NSCLCs and non-neoplastic lung parenchyma for the first time. We analysed60 tumours by means of immunohistochemistry and quan-titative real-time RT-PCR, 16 of which were also analysedby Western blotting, and provide immunohistochemical andmolecular evidence of FAK up-regulation in NSCLCs. FAKdistribution within neoplastic tissue was quite diffuse andhomogeneous, thus supporting its potential role in confer-ring an advantage on growth and survival, and giving tumourcells more invasive behaviour [16]. We also found that FAKup-regulation is common in NSCLCs, regardless of tumourhistotype and grade: weak-moderate FAK immunostainingwas detected in ciliated basal epithelial cells, ductal cellsof the submucosal glands of the bronchus, as well as inchondrocytes and vessel endothelial cells of non-neoplasticlung parenchyma. Interestingly, more intense FAK proteinimmunostaining was observed in bronchial squamous meta-plastic epithelium and hyperplastic alveolar cells, which areconsidered reactive changes that may evolve into dysplasticand neoplastic transformations.These immunohistochemical observations may partiallyexplain our quantitative Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR evaluations of FAK protein and mRNA in non-neoplasticlung tissues. FAK mRNA levels were significantly higher in theneoplastic than in the non-neoplastic lung samples, which isconsistent with previous observations of FAK overexpressionin human malignancies [16]. Moreover, all of the neoplas-tic samples whose FAK overexpression was determined byWestern blotting and real-time RT-PCR came from patientswith a high tumour stage at the time of resection. Takentogether, these findings suggest that FAK up-regulation maybe an early event in lung neoplastic transformation, and fur-ther support previously published data favouring its crucialrole in the development and maintenance of human cancers[17,32,33].csipt; the quantitative densitometric ratio between the neoplasticplotted under the gel images. As a gel loading control, thetwo independent experiments with similar results.We also found that the expression of \ufffd1-integrin does nothange in NSCLCs, and so it is possible that FAK up-regulationay be specific to NSCLCs. Furthermore, the up-regulation isot accompanied by any changes in FAK activity, as assessedy evaluating the extent of protein phosphorylation [32]:he five tyrosine residues analysed (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576,yr577 and Tyr861) proved to be equally phosphorylated inhe neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. It is known thatne of the possible mechanisms involved in FAK regulations the action of p53, which inhibits FAK transcription [31],ut we found that the expression of p53 in our tumour sam-les overexpressing FAK was comparable with that in theontrol non-tumoural lung tissues. It is possible that the up-egulation of FAK may be due to the amplification of its gener p53 gene mutations.FAK overexpression in human malignancies has been asso-iated with cancer cell migration and invasiveness, and moreggressive tumour behaviour including distant and/or nodaletastases [17,23,24,38,39]. The lack of FAK signalling inhe endothelial cells of FAK\u2212/\u2212 mice embryos has shownhat the function of this protein is crucial for morphogene-is and the formation of blood vessels [40]. In addition, FAKctivation in mouse microvascular endothelial cells is neces-ary to regulate in vitro tube formation [41]. We found FAKmmunoreactivity in the endothelial cells of both neoplasticnd adjacent non-neoplastic lung parenchyma, similarly toreviously described findings in the vascular network of oralquamous cancers [41], and the microvascular endothelialells of malignant astrocytic tumours [42]. These charac-eristics may explain the invasive and metastatic malignanthenotype of tumours overexpressing FAK.In conclusion, our study provides the first immunohisto-hemical and molecular evidence that increased FAK tran-cript levels and protein expression are common eventsn NSCLC. By immunohistochemistry, FAK protein overex-ression was also detectable in reactive changes, such ashe squamous cell metaplasia of bronchial epithelial cells2attrbtTlinvpfATIR[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[70nd alveolar hyperplasia. The immunohistochemical detec-ion of FAK overexpression in all of our cases regardless ofumour stage supports the hypothesis that FAK may play aole in maintaining the malignancy of the morphological andiological characteristics of transformed lung cells, ratherhan a crucial role in the later stages of NSCLC progression.he detection of FAK overexpression, particularly at proteinevel, may represent a novel target for inhibitory therapiesn lung cancer [43]. However, the up-regulation of FAK couldot be statistically related to disease-free or overall sur-ival in our patients probably because of the short follow-uperiod. The prognostic significance of FAK in NSCLCs there-ore requires further evaluation.cknowledgementhis work was supported in part by a grant from Associazionetaliana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC).eferences[1] Aplin AE, Howe AK, Juliano RL.
