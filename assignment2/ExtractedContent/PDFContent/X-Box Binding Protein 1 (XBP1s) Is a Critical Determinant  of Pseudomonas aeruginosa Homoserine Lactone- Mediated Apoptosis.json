Quorum sensing, mediated by small molecules including N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)homoserine lactone (C12), regulates P. aeruginosa growth and virulence. In addition, host cell recognition of C12 initiatesmultiple signalling responses including cell death. To gain insight into mechanisms of C12-mediated cytotoxicity, westudied the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in host cell responses to C12. Dramatic protection against C12-mediatedcell death was observed in cells that do not produce the X-box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s). The leucinezipper and transcriptional activation motifs of XBP1s were sufficient to restore C12-induced caspase activation in XBP1s-deficient cells, although this polypeptide was not transcriptionally active. The XBP1s polypeptide also regulated caspaseactivation in cells stimulated with N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C14), produced by Yersinia enterolitica andBurkholderia pseudomallei, and enhanced homoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation in the presence of endogenousXBP1s. In C12-tolerant cells, responses to C12 including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eukaryotic initiation factor 2awere conserved, suggesting that C12 cytotoxicity is not heavily dependent on these pathways. In summary, this studyreveals a novel and unconventional role for XBP1s in regulating host cell cytotoxic responses to bacterial acyl homoserinelactones.Citation: Valentine CD, Anderson MO, Papa FR, Haggie PM (2013) X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1s) Is a Critical Determinant of Pseudomonas aeruginosaHomoserine Lactone-Mediated Apoptosis.

P. aeruginosa is the fourth most-commonly isolatednosocomial pathogen and infections can be fatal, particularly inimmuno-compromised subjects such as those with burns orundergoing chemotherapy [1,2,3,4]. Chronic conditions includingcystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-CF bronchiectasisare also associated with P. aeruginosa infection [5,6,7]. Antimicro-bials are currently used against P. aeruginosa; however, infectionsare typically refractory to therapeutic interventions [8]. Further-more, drug resistant P. aeruginosa strains have been isolated andbiofilm formation in chronic conditions enhances antimicrobialresistance and pathogenicity [9,10]. As such, there is urgent needto understand mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence and for newstrategies to combat infections [10,11].The process of quorum sensing (QS) has evolved as amechanism by which bacterial communities sense cell densityand consequently regulate processes such as growth, biofilmformation and expression of virulence factors [12,13]. Bacteriasynthesize small, diffusible molecules to coordinate QS and amajor signal generated by P. aeruginosa is N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)homoserine lactone (C12, Figure 1A). In addition to regulating P.aeruginosa responses, C12 activates host cell responses via a processtermed inter-kingdom signalling [14]. C12 is cytotoxic in a dosedependent manner in macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts andepithelial cells [15,16,17,18]. Additional C12-activated hostresponses include phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activatedprotein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translationinitiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and synthesis of c-jun mRNA [17]. C12represses transcriptional activation of nuclear factor k-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) -responsive genes instimulated macrophages, T-cells and fibroblasts [19,20,21]. Incontrast, C12 has also been reported to intrinsically activate pro-inflammatory responses, including elevation of prostaglandin E2and cyclooxygenase 2 levels, in certain cell types [22,23]. Finally,C12 affects calcium homeostasis by releasing calcium stores fromthe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [18,24,25].Knowledge of how host cells recognize and respond to C12 isincomplete, although it is believed that C12 may interact withmultiple host targets in a cell-type dependent manner [14]. Thebitter taste receptor T2R38 was recently demonstrated toPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576recognize C12 [26]. Stimulation of T2R38 by C12 activatesmucociliary clearance and nitric oxide production to facilitatebacterial clearance and killing in primary airway epithelial cultures[26]. Polymorphisms in the T2R38 gene associated with Gram-negative sinonasal infections were demonstrated to reduce airwayresponsiveness to C12 indicating that C12\u2013host interactions arepathologically relevant [26]. C12 is cell permeable and membersof the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nuclear hormonereceptor family have been proposed to respond to C12 [27]. Incontrast, it has been suggested that C12 and other similar acylhomoserine lactones interact directly with host cell membranes toalter membrane polarity and consequently mediate cellularresponses [28]. Although innate immune system receptors arecapable of recognizing diverse pathogen-derived molecules, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide-binding, oligomerizationdomain (NOD)-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2 are not required forC12 recognition [17].The overall objective of this study was to gain insight into howC12 causes cell death. Several C12-induced cellular responses,including morphological changes to ER structure, phosphorylationof eIF2a and disruption of calcium homeostasis, are characteristicof ER stress [17,24,25]. ER stress typically activates intrinsicapoptosis [29,30] and additional C12-initiated responses includingcytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 9activation, suggest that this pathway is involved in C12 cytotoxicity[17,18,25]. As such, we tested the hypothesis that ER stressinitiates C12-mediated cell death. Unexpectedly, these studiesidentified the X box-binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s)as a major regulator of C12-mediated cell death. In this study, wereport that: (i) XBP1s regulates C12 cytotoxicity by a novel, non-transcriptional mechanism; (ii) XBP1s mediates cellular responsesto C12 and similar acyl homoserine lactones in a cell type-independent manner and; (iii) C12-mediated cellular responsesoccur via XBP1s-dependent and independent pathways.ResultsDeletion of inositol-requiring enzyme 1a is protectiveagainst C12-mediated cell deathThree sensors monitor ER protein folding stress; PERK (proteinkinase RNA-like ER kinase), IRE1a (inositol-requiring enzyme 1a)and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) [30,31]. Of thesesensors, PERK and IRE1a have been associated with ER stress-activated apoptotic responses [31,32,33]. Therefore, to investigatethe role of ER stress response pathways in C12 cytotoxicity, wildtype (wt) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and knockoutMEFs that do not express PERK (Perk2/2) or IRE1a (Ire1a2/2)were challenged with C12 and cytotoxic responses characterized.Significant cell death was observed in C12-treated wt MEFs(,40% at 4 hours), as assessed by comparison of cell labelling withthe supravital dye calcein before and after C12-treatment(Figure 1B, first panels, and Figure 1C). The response of Perk2/2MEFs to C12 was similar to that in wt MEFs indicating that C12cytotoxicity is not dependent upon PERK activity (Figure 1B, thirdpanels, and Figure 1C). In contrast, Ire1a2/2MEFs were resistantto C12 cytotoxicity suggesting that C12-induced cell death isIRE1a-dependent (Figure 1B, fourth panels, and Figure 1C). RT-PCR and western blot analysis was performed to verify the identityof knockout cell lines used in these studies (Figure 1B, right).Caspase (cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease) acti-vation has previously been implicated in C12-mediated cell death[17,18]; however, caspases have not definitively been demonstrat-ed to mediate C12 cytotoxicity. As such, caspase activity in C12-challenged MEFs was characterized to further investigate themechanism of C12 cytotoxicity. In wt MEFs, the pan-caspaseinhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited C12-cytotoxicity (,90% cellsremained at 4 hours) suggesting that cell death requires caspaseactivation (Figure 1B, second panels and Figure 1C, grey bar). Severalfamilies of cysteine proteases can be inhibited by z-VAD-fmk;however, inhibition of cathepsin B (CA-074-Me) or calpain(ALLN) did not reduce C12 toxicity in wt MEFs (Figure S1A).As such, z-VAD-fmk effects in C12-treated MEFs were caspasespecific and C12 cytotoxicity is dependent upon caspase activa-tion. Direct measurements of executioner caspase (caspase 3 and 7)activity in MEF cell lines stimulated with 25 mM C12 indicatedthat Ire1a deletion dramatically reduced caspase activation relativeto wt and Perk2/2MEFs (Figure 1D). Reported concentrations ofC12 in liquid culture and biofilms vary from 5 to 600 mM [21,34];therefore, we assessed caspase activation in wt MEFs in responseto low C12 concentrations (Figure 1E and Figure S1B).Executioner caspase activation was significantly enhanced by4 hour treatment with low C12 concentration (5 mM and 10 mMC12 produced ,2-fold and ,5-fold increases respectively) andprogressively increased with higher C12 doses. Taken together,these studies indicate that C12-cytotoxicity in MEFs: (i) requirescaspases such that cell death can formally be classified asapoptosis, (ii) is highly dependent on IRE1a activity and, (iii) isindependent of PERK activity.IRE1a deletion indirectly prevents C12 apoptosisIRE1a is a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER andcontains cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activ-ities [30,35]. During homeostatic conditions, IRE1a RNaseactivity is limited, although it does mediate sequence specific,non-conventional splicing of a pre-mRNA (Xbp1u) to generatemature mRNA (Xbp1s) that encodes the X-box binding protein 1transcription factor (XBP1s) [30,33,35]. Xbp1u pre-mRNA alsoencodes XBP1u protein that binds to and regulates XBP1s stability[36]; the internal location of the Xbp1u splice site dictates thatXBP1u and XBP1s share a common amino terminus. Duringperiods of irremediable ER stress, as observed in pathologicalconditions such as neurodegeneration and type II diabetes, IRE1abecomes hyper-activated leading to apoptosis driven by promis-cuous IRE1a RNase activity and/or activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream target c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) [33,37,38,39].Author SummaryChronic and acute infections associated with P. aeruginosaconstitute a major healthcare burden. Antimicrobialapproaches are currently used against P. aeruginosa;however, infections are typically refractory to treatmentand drug resistant strains have been isolated. As such,there is urgent need to understand mechanisms of P.aeruginosa virulence and for new strategies to fightinfections. The P. aeruginosa-derived quorum-sensingmolecule C12 is recognized by host cells and initiatesstress responses including cytotoxicity. In this study, the X-box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s) wasidentified as a host factor critical for apoptotic responsesinitiated by C12 and other similar quorum sensingmolecules. Additional C12-initiated host responses, includ-ing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2a were found tobe of lesser importance for C12-initiated cytotoxicity.These studies have broad implications for our understand-ing of bacterial virulence mechanisms and for develop-ment of potential new strategies to combat infections.XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced ApoptosisPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576Treatment of wt MEFs with STF-083010, a selective andirreversible inhibitor of IRE1a RNase activity [39,40], did notinhibit C12-mediated toxicity or caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 2A,left and Figure 2B). Similarly, treatment of wt MEFs with a JNKinhibitor (SP600125) did not reduce C12 cytotoxicity (Figure 2A,right) or activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure S1C). A prerequisite forIRE1a-mediated apoptotic signalling is IRE1a activation, aprocess that involves oligomerization and trans-autophosphory-lation [33,37]. Therefore, to further investigate a possible role ofIRE1a in C12-mediated cytotoxic responses, IRE1a activity wasdirectly assessed using a luciferase-based reporter (XBP1-luc). TheXBP1-luc reporter encodes cDNA containing the Xbp1u pre-mRNA splice site fused upstream of a luciferase gene ([41], see alsoMATERIALS AND METHODS). In the absence of IRE1aactivity, an \u2018in-frame\u2019 stop codon prevents luciferase expression(Figure 2C, top left); however, upon IRE1a-mediated pre-mRNAsplicing (which removes 26 nucleotides), the stop codon is shunted\u2018out-of-frame\u2019 and luciferase is expressed to report IRE1a activity(Figure 2C, bottom left). In wt MEFs expressing XBP1-luc, IRE1aactivity was not increased above control levels after 2 hours of C12stimulation (Figure 2C, right). In contrast, exposure of cells tothapsigargin, a known ER stress-inducing agent, producedsignificant enhancement of IRE1a activity over the same timeframe (Figure 2C, right). Treatment of wt MEFs for 2 hours withC12 or thapsigargin produced relatively little cell loss (,10%,Figure S1A). Data obtained in an additional cell type suggestedthat the absence of significant IRE1a activation in response to C12stimulation is a generalized phenomenon (Figure S1D). Insummary, these studies: (i) provide pharmacological evidence thatIRE1a is not directly involved in C12-mediated cytotoxicity and,(ii) demonstrate that C12 stimulation of cells does not significantlyactivate the IRE1a ER stress sensor.Ire1a2/2MEFs synthesize Xbp1u pre-mRNA; however, Xbp1usplicing and XBP1s protein are undetectable in this cell typeindicating that IRE1a is uniquely responsible for processing ofXbp1u pre-mRNA in MEFs ([33,42], see also Figure S2A). As such,C12 cytotoxic responses were assessed directly in Xbp12/2MEFsto test the hypothesis that reduced C12 cytotoxicity in Ire1a2/2MEFs results from loss of XBP1s function(s). C12 stimulation ofXbp12/2MEFs produced little apparent reduction in cell densityFigure 1. Deletion of Ire1a prevents C12 cytotoxicity. A.

The identity ofXbp12/2MEFs used in these studies was confirmed by RT-PCRand western blot analysis (Figure 2D, bottom). Additional experi-ments were performed to characterize the apparent tolerance ofXbp12/2MEFs to C12 cytotoxicity. Treatment of wt MEFs withC12 produced time- and dose-dependent increases in caspase 3/7activity, similar to observations made in other cell types[15,16,17,18] (Figure 2E, black bars). In contrast, caspase 3/7activation only increased by ,2\u20134-fold in Xbp12/2 MEFsstimulated with 25 mM C12 for up to 8 hours or with C12concentrations increasing to 100 mM (Figure 2E, grey bars). Similarresults were obtained in Ire1a2/2MEFs although controlexperiments verified that levels of executioner caspases inXbp12/2and Ire1a2/2MEFs were similar to those in wild typecells (Figure S1E and data not shown). As such, these studiesindicate that C12 cytotoxicity requires the presence of XBP1s andthat reduced levels of the XBP1s do not merely alter the kinetics orsensitivity of cellular responses to C12.To investigate whether XBP1s loss-of-function was directlyresponsible for C12 tolerance, Xbp12/2and Ire1a2/2MEFs weretransiently transfected with Xbp1 cDNA and responses to C12were characterized. As predicted from direct measurement ofexecutioner caspase activation, treatment of wt MEFs with C12produced robust caspase 3-cleavage that could be detected byimmunostaining (Figure 3A). Similarly, as expected from mea-surements of executioner caspase activity, cleaved caspase 3 wasessentially absent in C12-stimulated Xbp12/2and Ire1a2/2MEFs(Figure 3B and C, left panels). Transfection of Xbp12/2MEFs withcDNA encoding either Xbp1u pre-mRNA (which can be processedby IRE1a; Figure 3B, middle) or Xbp1s mRNA (Figure 3B, right)restored caspase 3 cleavage upon C12 treatment in a large numberof cells. In contrast, transfection of Ire1a2/2MEFs with Xbp1scDNA (Figure 3C right), but not Xbp1u cDNA (which is presentendogenously but remains unspliced, Figure 3C, middle), restoredcaspase-3 cleavage upon C12 treatment. In control experiments,C12-treatment of Xbp12/2MEFs transfected with an emptyplasmid was not associated with caspase 3-cleavage, verifying thattransfection of this cell type was not responsible for caspaseactivation (Figure S1F). Taken together, these experimentsindicate that expression of XBP1s in XBP1s-deficient MEFs(Xbp12/2or Ire1a2/2MEFs) is sufficient to re-establish C12-mediated caspase cleavage.C12-mediated apoptosis does not require XBP1stranscriptional activityXBP1s is a member of the cAMP response element-bindingprotein (CREB)/ATF basic region\u2013leucine zipper family oftranscription factors and, consistent with this function, XBP1s ismodular containing a polybasic region, a leucine zipper motif anda transcriptional activation domain [36] (Figure 4B). Therefore,experiments were conducted to investigate whether XBP1stranscriptional activity was required for C12-mediated apoptosis.Treatment of wt MEFs with inhibitors of transcription (actino-mycin) or translation (cycloheximide) during C12 stimulation didnot prevent caspase activation (Figure 4A). As such, in response toC12-stimulation, neither acute activation of XBP1s transcriptionalactivity nor acute protein synthesis of an XBP1s-dependenttranscript are responsible for C12-induced apoptosis.To gain insight into the role of XBP1s domains in C12-mediated apoptosis, a series of XBP1s truncation constructs weregenerated (Figure 4B). In wt MEFs, XBP1s is predominantlylocalized to the nucleus, although in agreement with priorbiochemical analysis, low levels of XBP1s could also be detectedin the cytoplasm [36] (Figure 4C and Figure S2B). Deletion of theamino terminus and polybasic region from XBP1s produced atruncation construct (XBP1D1) that was distributed throughout thecell (Figure 4B and 4C). When expressed in Ire1a2/2or Xbp12/2MEFs, XBP1D1 was able to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage uponC12 treatment (Figure 4D, left). In a similar manner, an XBP1struncation construct that consisted of only the leucine zipper andtranscriptional activation domains (XBP1D2) was distributedthroughout the cell (Figure 4B and 4C) and restored caspase 3cleavage in C12-stimulated Ire1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs(Figure 4D, middle). A truncation construct encompassing theamino-terminal domains of XBP1s (XBP1N, Figure 4B) failed tore-establish caspase 3 cleavage in C12 stimulated Ire1a2/2orXbp12/2MEFs (Figure 4D, right). As such, consideration of C12-mediated caspase 3-cleavage in XBP1s-deficient MEFs expressingXBP1D2 or XBP1N suggested that the transcriptional activationdomain of XBP1s contains a protein sequence that is responsiblefor C12-mediated caspase activation. However, instability ofadditional XBP1s truncation constructs that were generatedprecluded further analysis to identify a minimal XBP1s regionthat is necessary for C12-mediated caspase 3-cleavage. Forinstance, truncation constructs such as those that encode theXBP1s transcriptional activation domain and carboxy-terminus orthe XBP1s transcriptional activation domain alone could not bedetected by immunocytochemistry or western blot analysis (FigureS2C and data not shown). As such, our analysis indicates that theleucine zipper and transcriptional activation domains of XBP1s(XBP1D2) constitute a minimal XBP1s region that can be stablyexpressed and is sufficient for caspase activation in C12-treatedIre1a2/2or Xbp12/2MEFs.Next, experiments were performed to assess the ability of XBP1struncation constructs to mediate transcriptional activity. In theseassays, wt MEFs were co-transfected with an XBP1s-responsiveluciferase reporter and either XBP1s or an XBP1s truncationconstruct [43,44]. As expected, robust transcriptional responseswere observed when XBP1s was co-expressed with the reporter(Figure 4E). In contrast, XBP1N, which lacks a transcriptionalactivation domain, was not associated with transcriptional activity(Figure 4E). The XBP1D1 and XBP1D2 truncation constructs thatrestore caspase 3-cleavage in C12-treated Ire1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs were also not associated with XBP1s-dependent transcrip-tional activity (Figure 4E and Figure S2A). Taken together, thesestudies indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptionalactivation domains of XBP1s (XBP1D2) constitute a minimal,stable XBP1s fragment that restores caspase activation upon C12stimulation in XBP1s-deficient cells and; (ii) C12-mediatedapoptosis does not require XBP1s-transcriptional activity.XBP1s regulates a common mechanism for acylhomoserine lactone-mediated caspase activationAcyl homoserine lactones are a common chemical scaffold usedby diverse bacterial species for QS [12]. Therefore, experimentswere performed to investigate if XBP1s-dependent mechanismsmediate cellular responses to N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserinelactone (C14, Figure 5A), a QS molecule generated by the gram-negative, pathogenic bacteria Yersinia enterolitica and Burkholderiapseudomallei. Treatment of wt MEFs with C14 produced significantcell death, as assessed by calcein AM fluorescence (Figure 5B, left),and activation of executioner caspases (Figure 5C, right). Incontrast, Ire1a2/2MEFs were largely resistant to C14-mediatedcytotoxicity (Figure 5B, right) and demonstrated significantlyreduced caspase activation (,20%) relative to wt cells(Figure 5C, right). As expected from direct measurements ofcaspase activity, robust cleavage of caspase 3 could be detected inXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced ApoptosisPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576C14-treated wt MEFs; however, cleaved caspase 3 immunostain-ing was largely absent in Ire1a2/2MEFs (Figure 5D). Transfectionof Ire1a2/2MEF cells to express either XBP1s or XBP1D2restored caspase 3-cleavage in C14 treated cells (Figure 5D), asobserved in C12-treated cells.Studies were also performed to investigate whether XBP1D2affects cytotoxic response to acyl homoserine lactones in other celltypes. A Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cell line was generated that washighly enriched for expression of XBP1D2 (FRT-XBP1D2,Figure 5E, left). Treatment of FRT-XBP1D2 with C12 or C14resulted in increased activation of executioner caspases relative tocontrol cells (FRTcon, Figure 5E, right). Similarly, enhancedcaspase activation was observed in a Hela cell line enriched forXBP1D2 expression upon treatment with C12 or C14 (Figure 5F).It is noteworthy that in all cell types studied C14 produced higherlevels of caspase activation than C12. Studies with further acylhomoserine lactones indicated that acyl chains of .12 carbonatoms and substitution at the third carbon of the acyl chain arerequired for toxicity (Figure S3). Taken together, these experi-ments indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptionalactivation domains (XBP1D2) of XBP1s regulate activation ofcaspases in response to different homoserine lactones and, (ii)XBP1D2 results in increased caspase activation in the presence ofendogenous XBP1s.C12 activates alternative cellular responses via XBP1s-independent mechanismsC12 activates multiple stress response signalling pathways inhost cells [14,17]. The observation that Ire1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs are protected from C12-induced cell death afforded theopportunity to investigate whether distinct cellular signallingresponses are associated with or unrelated to C12 cytotoxicity.Phosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK have previously beenreported in primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells[17]. In agreement with this study, increased phospho-eIF2a (p-eIF2a; ,2.5-fold change) and phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38MAPK; ,2.5-fold change) could also be detected in wt MEFsafter C12 exposure for 45 minutes (Figure 6A, top panels). A similarpattern of phosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK was observedin C12-treated Ire1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs (Figure 6A, middle andbottom panels; ,2.5 and ,3-fold increases in p-eIF2a, and ,2.5Figure 2.

As bothIre1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs are resistant to C12 cytotoxicity,these studies also suggest that phosphorylation of p-eIF2a and p-p38 MAPK does not contribute greatly to C12-mediated celldeath in MEFs. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of p38MAPK activity (using SB203580 or SB202190) did not inhibit C12cytotoxicity or caspase 3/7 activation in wt MEFs (data notshown).PERK phosphorylates eIF2a during periods of ER stress [32];therefore, experiments were performed to investigate whetherPERK is activated by C12. Phosphorylation of eIF2a was,however, preserved in C12-treated Perk2/2MEFs (Figure 6B,top; ,3-fold increase). As expected, control experiments confirmedthat ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA) produced p-eIF2a inwt MEFs (,4-fold increase) but not Perk2/2 MEFs (,0.9-foldchange) (Figure 6B, middle and bottom). Together, these studiesindicate that C12 challenge activates alternative kinase(s) activityto generate p-eIF2a; however, they do not formally demonstratethat PERK does not contribute to eIF2a phosphorylation.Levels of c-jun mRNA have also been reported to increase inC12-treated primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells[17]. In wt MEFs, c-Jun protein levels increased by approximatelytwo-fold after 90 minutes treatment with 25 mM C12 (Figure 6C,left, and Figure 6D). In contrast, c-Jun protein levels were notaltered by C12 in Ire1a2/2or Xbp12/2MEFs (Figure 6C, middleFigure 3. Transient expression of XBP1s restores caspase 3 cleavage in Xbp12/2 and Ire1a2/2 MEFs.

At present, these studies cannotdistinguish whether c-Jun levels increase in wt MEFs in an XBP1s(or IRE1a) -dependent manner or due to C12-mediated cytotox-icity; however, these studies confirm that C12 cytotoxicity isassociated with increased c-Jun levels. It is noteworthy that inunstimulated conditions, c-Jun levels in wt and knockout MEFsvaried by approximately three-fold; as such, elevated levels of c-Jun, at least in the absence of XBP1s, are not sufficient to mediateC12 cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that C12-mediated hostcell responses occur via both XBP1s-dependent and -independentmechanisms and C12-mediated production of p-eIF2a and p-p38MAPK in MEFs does not contribute greatly to cell death.DiscussionInfections associated with P. aeruginosa result in significantmortality and constitute a major worldwide healthcare burden.Our understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms islimited and there is an urgent need to identify new approachesthat can be employed to reduce P. aeruginosa infectivity. P.aeruginosa employ QS to regulate growth, virulence factorexpression and biofilm formation. In addition to quorumsignalling, P. aeruginosa-derived C12 homoserine lactone activatesseveral host cell responses including cytotoxicity. The majorconclusion of this study is that C12-mediated host cell cytotoxicresponses largely require expression of the XBP1s transcriptionfactor (Figure 7). Cell death and caspase activation weredramatically reduced (,95%) in cells that cannot generateXBP1s (Ire1a2/2MEFs) or lack the XBP1 gene (Xbp12/2MEFs).To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the firstdescription of cells that are C12-tolerant due to genetic ablationof a protein. Restoring XBP1s expression in either Ire1a2/2orXbp12/2MEFs was sufficient to re-establish caspase 3 cleavageupon C12 stimulation. Although the present study does notprovide full mechanistic detail, we demonstrate that a fragment ofXBP1s encompassing the leucine zipper and transcriptionalFigure 4.

Knockoutcell lines were used to incisively demonstrate the role of XBP1s inhomoserine lactone-mediated cell death; however, expression ofXBP1D2 in rat and human epithelial cells resulted in enhancedcaspase activation in response to C12- and C14-stimulation,indicating that XBP1s can mediate apoptotic responses in distinctcell types. Further experiments will be required to establish thatXBP1s regulates C12-mediated apoptosis in cells that are exposedto P. aeruginosa, including macrophages, neutrophils and airwayepithelial cells; however, XBP1s is expressed at high levels inthese cells [45].The concentration of C12 observed in liquid cultures is ,5 mMand biofilms may generate up to ,600 mM C12 [21,34].

Cellular responses, including phosphorylation of p38 MAPKand eIF2a were reported in cells exposed to 5\u201310 mM C12 [17]. Invivo studies indicate that low concentrations of C12 (1\u201310 mM)produce profound responses [46]. Furthermore, it has beenproposed that host cells may be exposed to high local C12concentrations generated by P. aeruginosa structures includingmicro-colonies and biofilms [47,48]. The only rigorous validatedC12 receptor is T2R38, this bitter taste receptor is activated byC12 to stimulate host antimicrobial responses including nitricoxide synthesis and mucociliary clearance [26]. In human subjects,common loss-of-function polymorphism in T2R38 were linked tohost susceptibility to sinonasal gram-negative bacterial infections,suggesting that T2R38 is a key determinant of upper airway innatedefense mechanisms [26]. In primary cell cultures, TR238-mediated antimicrobial responses were stimulated by C12 in theconcentration range 10\u2013100 mM. As such, we predict that C12concentrations considered in these studies will be clinicallyrelevant. Formal verification that C12-mediated cytotoxicityenhances P. aeruginosa virulence will require identification ofpharmacological tools that can be used to block caspase activationin vivo.XBP1s is a member of the CREB/ATF basic region-leucinezipper family of transcription factors and performs pleiotropictranscriptional functions. Approaches including expression profil-ing and chromatin immunoprecipitation have revealed thatXBP1s regulates gene expression for both constitutive andinducible arms of ER stress response pathways; however,XBP1s-responsive promoter regions also regulate expression ofgenes involved in signal transduction, redox homeostasis, cellgrowth and differentiation and carbohydrate metabolism[35,44,49]. Studies in knock-out mice have revealed that XBP1sis essential for hepatogenesis, B lymphocytes differentiation,cardiac myogenesis and development of exocrine tissue[50,51,52,53]. Targeted deletion of XBP1s in murine intestinalepithelial cells results in enhanced inflammatory responses andFigure 6. XBP1-independent cellular responses to C12. A.

Role of XBP1s in C12-mediated cellular responses.Activation of caspases is dependent upon XBP1s, albeit by a mechanismthat does not involve transcription. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK andeIF2a is XBP1s-independent. Stimulation of cells with C12 does notactivate IRE1a and presumably does not activate other ER stressresponse pathways. No inferences about c-Jun synthesis can be drawnfrom the current study.doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003576.g007XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced ApoptosisPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576Xbp1 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn\u2019s disease andulcerative colitis [54]. In C. elegans, P. aeruginosa-mediated PMK-1p38 MAPK activation during development induces ER stress thatis lethal in the absence of XBP1s [55]. In general, these studiesindicate that XBP1s typically acts in a protective manner to restorecellular homeostasis when protein load on the ER is excessive [35].XBP1s function has, however, been linked to cell death and overlong time courses (days) increased levels of XBP1s have beenassociated with apoptosis in endothelial and pancreatic b cells[56,57]. The current study represents the first descriptions of anunconventional (non-transcriptional) role for XBP1s and of afunction for XBP1s in regulating acute apoptosis.Additional insights into the role of cell stress response pathwaysin C12 stimulated cells are afforded by the present study(summarized in Figure 7). Activation of ER stress responsepathways has been proposed as a mechanism by which C12initiates host cell responses [14,48]. Direct assessment of IRE1asplicing activity and pharmacological inhibition of apoptoticpathways that are initiated by IRE1a suggests that C12 does notactivate IRE1a. An additional inference that can be drawn fromthese observations is that \u2018house-keeping\u2019 levels of XBP1s aresufficient to mediate apoptotic responses to C12. However, it isnoteworthy that immune responses initiated by P. aeruginosa (viaTLR4 and TLR5) will result in IRE1a-activation and increasedlevels of XBP1s [58]. ER stress-induced PERK activation has alsobeen proposed to be responsible for C12-mediated eIF2aphosphorylation; however, robust eIF2a phosphorylation wasobserved in Perk2/2MEFs suggesting that an alternative kinase(s)catalyzes this response. Although the present studies do notformally rule out PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, thisscenario seems unlikely given that: (i) C12-mediated IRE1a ERstress responses are negligible, (ii) PERK and IRE1a sense ERstress by a similar mechanism [59] and, (iii) deletion of PERK doesnot alter cytotoxic responses to C12. In response to cell stress,eIF2a is also phosphorylated by eIF2a kinase 1 (the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase), eIF2a kinase 2 (protein kinase RNA-activated, PKR) or eIF2a kinase 4 (GCN2) [60]; further work willbe required to establish which eIF2a kinase(s) responds to C12.The role of individual stress response pathways to overall C12-mediated cytotoxicity is not well understood. The observationsthat p38 MAPK phosphorylation is conserved in Ire1a2/2andXbp12/2MEFs and that pharmacological inhibition of p38MAPK does not prevent C12-mediated apoptosis suggest that thispathway is of limited importance to C12-mediated cell death.Similarly, eIF2a phosphorylation is preserved in Ire1a2/2andXbp12/2MEFs also suggesting that this cellular response has littlerelevance to C12-mediated apoptosis. Finally, it is noteworthy thatcaspases are activated in Ire1a2/2and Xbp12/2MEFs in responseto C12-stimulation, albeit at dramatically reduced levels (,5%)relative to wt MEFs. As such, our study indicates that XBP1s-dependent and -independent processes that contribute to caspaseactivation are initiated in C12-stimulated cells, but that XBP1s-dependent mechanisms are dominant.How might XBP1s contribute to cell death in C12-stimulatedcells? Our study formally verifies that caspase activation mediatesapoptotic cell death in MEFs. Executioner caspase activity wasostensibly used as a metric of cell death; however, caspase 8 wasalso activated in C12-stimulated MEFs (data not shown) aspreviously reported in other cell types [16,18]. Caspase 8activation typically indicates that extrinsic apoptotic pathwaysinitiated by cell surface receptors are operating [29]. As such, wespeculate that XBP1s promotes initiation of extrinsic apoptoticresponses through formation of the death-inducing signallingcomplex in a C12-dependent manner. Precedents of leucinezipper-containing proteins causing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosishave been reported. Similar to XBP1s, the prostrate apoptosisresponse-4 protein (Par-4) contains a leucine zipper motif andnuclear localization sequences. Depending upon cell type, Par-4has been demonstrated to either sensitize cellular responses toapoptotic stimuli or to directly activate apoptosis; however, themechanism of these responses is not fully elucidated [61]. Furtherstudies will be required to test the hypothesis that XBP1s mediatesactivation of extrinsic apoptotic responses in a C12-dependentfashion.In summary, the present study identifies XBP1s as a keydeterminant of apoptotic responses initiated by QS moleculegenerated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterolitica and Burk-holderia pseudomallei. The leucine zipper and transcriptionalactivation domains of XBP1 are sufficient to mediate apoptoticresponses; however, XBP1s transcriptional activity is not requiredfor cell death. These studies advance our understanding of hostresponses to C12 and should facilitate rational design ofapproaches to investigate whether C12-mediated host cellapoptosis is pathologically relevant.Materials and MethodsCell lines and cell cultureImmortalized wt and knockout MEF cell lines used in this studywere previously described and RT-PCR analysis of these cells wasperformed using published primer sequences [32,33,37,39]. MEFswere cultured in DMEM H21 supplemented with 10% fetalbovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/mlstreptomycin and nonessential amino acids. Fischer rat thyroid(FRT) epithelial cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culturefacility and cultured in Ham\u2019s F12 supplemented as for MEFs.Hela cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility andcultured in DMEM H21 supplemented as for MEFs. MEF andFRT cells were transfected using jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfec-tion) and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTXwith Plus reagent (Life Technologies).Reagents and chemicalsHomoserine lactones (including C12 (N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone) and C14 (N-(3-oxodotetradecanoyl)-L-homo-serine lactone)) were obtained from Sigma. For some experiments,C12 was prepared using a previously described synthetic route[62]. Structure and purity (.99%) of synthesized C12 wereconfirmed by proton NMR, and caspase activation in wt orXbp12/2MEFs was similar in response to synthesized orpurchased C12. Details of homoserine lactone dosing is providedin Figure Legends or text. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM),DAPI and thapsigargin was obtained from Life Technologies andused as directed by the manufacturer. Pharmacological modula-tors were purchased from various sources (as detailed below) andcells were typically pre-treated with compounds for 30 minutes, atconcentrations given in parenthesis, prior to homoserine lactonechallenge or other experimental maneuvers. Cycloheximide(5 mg/ml) and CA-074-Me (10 mM) were obtained from Calbio-chem. STF-080310 (50 mM) was obtained from Tocris. Z-VAD-fmk (10 mM) was obtained from Promega. SB203580 (10 mM),SB202190 (10 mM), SP600125 (10 mM), ALLN (10 mM), brefeldinA (1.25 mg/ml) and actinomycin (1 mg/ml) were obtained fromSanta Cruz Biotechnology.Antibodies, western blotting and immunocytochemistryAntibodies against, IRE1a, PERK, cleaved and full lengthcaspase 3 and 7, p-eIF2a, p-p38 MAPK and c-Jun were obtainedXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced ApoptosisPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576from Cell Signalling. Antibody against XBP1 was purchased fromSanta Cruz. Antibody against FLAG-tag was obtained fromSigma. Western blotting was performed using standard procedureswith chemiluminescence detection. Immunocytochemistry wasperformed on fixed and permeabilized cells using indirectimmunodetection with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-ondary antibodies and DAPI as a counterstain. Imaging wasperformed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscopeequipped with an Exfo X-Cite light source, Hamamatsu EM-CCDdeep-cooled camera and appropriate filter cubes and objectives(Nikon S Fluor 206N.A. 0.75 or Plan Fluor 406N.A. 0.75). Forquantitative immunodetection, cell from different experimentswere labelled in parallel, imaged with identical microscope settingsand analyzed using Fiji image processing software.Apoptosis assays and cell density analysisCaspase activity was measured using Caspase-Glo homoge-neous luminescent assays (Promega). In different experiments,caspase activation in C12-treated wt MEFs varied by ,50% forundetermined reasons. As such, control experiments were alwaysperformed and are presented, such that control data andexperimental maneuvers can be directly compared. Normalizedcaspase activation data is presented as mean 6 S.D. for anindividual experiment (comprised of 6\u201312 individual measure-ments), and is representative of at least duplicate experiments. Tocharacterize cell density, cells were labelled with calcein-AM andimaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope(described above) equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 106/NA 0.3objective. Relative cell number was calculated from background-corrected, integrated fluorescence areas and cell density wasderived by comparison of relative cell number before and after anexperimental maneuver. Data is presented as mean 6 S.E. andwas derived from 3\u20135 independent experiments in which 3\u20136 cellareas were imaged per experiment.Plasmids, molecular biology and luciferase-basedreporter assaysPlasmids containing FLAG-tagged murine XBP1u and XBP1scDNA were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 21832 and 21833;[63]). For experiments, the coding regions for XBP1u and XBP1swere excised as HindIII/XbaI fragments, subcloned intopcDNA3.1/Hygro, and an oligo duplex was used to regeneratethe FLAG-tag (amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDL). Carboxy-terminal FLAG-XBP1s truncations (Figure 4B) were generated bypcr as HindIII/XbaI-tagged amplicons that were subcloned intopcDNA3.1/Hygro containing an in-frame FLAG-tag. The amino-terminal FLAG-XBP1s truncation (Figure 4B) was generated bypcr as a BglII/EcoRI-tagged amplicon that was subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1; for experiments, FLAG-taggedXBP1 amino terminus was subsequently subcloned intopcDNA3.1/Hygro as an NheI/XbaI fragment. Domain boundariesfor truncations were based on those previously reported for humanXBP1s [36]. For FLAG-XBP1s, the polybasic, leucine zipper(which contains amino acids involved in transcription factordimerization) and transcriptional activation domains start atArg76, Ala94 and Ala168, the transcriptional activation domainends at Val283 and the amino terminal domain ends at Iso197(corresponding to residues Arg68, Ala86, Ala160, Val275 andIso189 of untagged XBP1s). Sequence analysis was used toconfirm all constructs generated in this study. For experiments inMEFs that assessed the role of full length and truncated XBP1regions in caspase activation, pcDNA3.1/Hygro was used as acontrol (empty) vector. Cell lines enriched for expression of anXBP1s deletion construct (XBP1D2, Figure 4B) were generated byrepeated culture of transfected cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin;cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro and selected in 300 mg/ml hygromycin (FRTcon and Helacon) were used as a control.A luciferase-based reporter of IRE1a activity was generouslyprovided by Albert Koong (Stanford University). Briefly, thisreporter (termed XBP1-luc) consists of cDNA encoding the first208 amino acids of human Xbp1, including a 26-nucleotide splicesite that is recognized by IRE1a, fused to firefly luciferase [41]. Aplasmid-based vector was generated for the current studies bysubcloning reporter cDNA (provided in the pLPCX retroviralvector, Clontech) into pcDNA3.1/Hygro as a HindIII/NotIfragment. Assays of IRE1a splicing activity were performed intransiently transfected wt MEFs or in an FRT cell populationenriched for expression of the reporter construct by repeatedculture of cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin. A luciferase basedreporter of XBP1s activity was purchased (pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/Hygro] (Promega)); this reporter contains five direct repeats of thesequence 59-ATCGAGACAGGTGCTGACGTGGCATTC-39and is similar to a previously described XBP1s-responsive reporter(UPRE/56ATF6GL3) [43,44]. Assays of XBP1 transcriptionalactivity were performed in MEFs transiently transfected withplasmids expressing full length or truncated XBP1s (orpcDNA3.1/Hygro as a control) and pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/Hygro] at a ratio of 9:1. Luciferase-based reporter assays wereperformed using the Bright-Glo Assay system as directed by themanufacturer (Promega).Supporting InformationFigure S1 A.

Carbons at position 1 and3 are highlighted in red (top). B. Representative images of calceinAM labelled wt MEFs treated with acyl homoserine lactones (4 h,25 mM or 50 mM of racemic mixtures; see also Figs. 1 and 5). C.Caspase 3/7 activation in wt (left) and Ire1a2/2(right) MEFs aftertreatment with acyl homoserine lactones (4 h, 25 mM or 50 mM ofracemic mixtures). No activation of caspases was observed whenacyl chains were ,12 carbon atoms in length. Substitutions atcarbons one and three are required for caspase activation and 3-oxo- substitutions produce significantly greater activation ofcaspases than 3-hydroyx- substitutions. Ire1a2/2MEFs areprotected from C12, C14 and C14-OH caspase activation relativeto wt MEFs.(TIF)AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Drs Alan S. Verkman, Alex J.
