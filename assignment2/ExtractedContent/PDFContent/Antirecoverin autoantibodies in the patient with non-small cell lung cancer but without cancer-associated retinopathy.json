Using immuno-blotting with recombinant recoverin as an antigen, we have detected anti-Rc in serumof the patient. At the same time, the patient did not manifest any signs of cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). Polyclonal (monospecific) antibodies against recoverinused for immunohistochemical analysis of the patient\u2019s tumor revealed recoverinexpression in the tumor sections. To our knowledge, this is the first case of thepresence of serum anti-Rc in NSCLC patients in the absence of paraneoplastic retinadegeneration.\u2013 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionParaneoplastic antigens are neuronal proteinswhich can also be expressed in transformed cellsoutside the nervous system. The aberrant expres-sion of these antigens is believed to be the cause ofa number of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes(for a review, see refs. [1\ufffd/3]). One of paraneo-plastic antigens, Ca2\ufffd-binding protein recoverin, isnormally specific for retina [4,5], but it can also bedetected in tissues different from retina providingtheir malignant transformation [6\ufffd/11]. A numberof patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)were found to have serum autoantibodies againstrecoverin (anti-Rc) [6,7,12\ufffd/16]. In contrast toSCLC, only one anti-Rc-positive patient with an-other kind of lung cancer, non-small cell lungcarcinoma (NSCLC), was known so far [11]. For atime, serum anti-Rc were only detected in patientswhen they had both lung cancers and cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) [6\ufffd/15]. However,Abbreviations: anti-Rc, autoantibodies against recoverin;CAR, cancer-associated retinopathy; NSCLC, non-small celllung carcinoma; SCLC, small cell lung carcinoma.*Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/S0169-5002(03)00239-3i An update to this article is included at the endmailto:ppph@belozersky.msu.ruwe have recently revealed several patients withSCLC who had serum anti-Rc, but had no manifes-tation of the CAR-syndrome [16]. In this work, weused recombinant recoverin to reveal anti-Rc inserum of a patient with NSCLC. In addition, weanalyzed paraffin tumor sections of the patient forrecoverin expression using antibodies against re-coverin.2. The patient and methodsA 69-year-old male with a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease had been smoking20 cigarettes per day for 59 years. He gave upsmoking in 1997 when he underwent lobectomy ofthe right lower lobe of the lung due to squamouscell carcinoma (pT1N0M0). During the next 2 years,the patient felt satisfactorily and continued towork. In June 1999, fibreoptic bronchoscopy de-tected a tumor at the right lower lobe stump of 2cm in diameter. Histological analysis of the tumorconfirmed the relapse of a poor differentiatedsquamous cell carcinoma. Chest computer tomo-graphy revealed metastases in the right ipsilateralmediastinal lymph nodes. As the patient refused toundergo any anti-cancer treatment, he got only asupportive care before the next hospitalization inSeptember 2000. Between hospitalizations in 1999and 2000, the state of the patient\u2019s health wasgradually deteriorating: he lost 7 kg (from 67 to 60kg), there appeared a pain in the back. Computertomography and fibreoptic bronchoscopy detectedthe development of the middle lobe atelectasis andmetastases in the ipsilateral mediastinal lymphnodes, spine radiography and bone scintigraphyrevealed vertebral body metastases (Th6-Th8), i.e.the objective examination confirmed the progres-sive disease (cT2N2M1). In addition to supportivecare, the patient received prednisolone (25 mg peros one time a day for 10 days) for treatment ofCOPD exacerbation. He died of progressive lungcancer in January 2001.2.1. Immunoblotting of serum samplesSerum samples were prepared from whole bloodof the NSCLC patient and stored at \ufffd/70 8C.Western blot analysis of the samples was per-formed as described in [16] with homogeneousrecombinant myristoylated recoverin as an antigen[17]. Rabbit polyclonal (monospecific) anti-reco-verin antibodies were prepared as described in[4,5] and used as a positive control; normal humansera served as a negative control.2.2. Immunohistochemical stainingTissue samples were fixed in 4% formaldegydeand embedded in paraffin. For an immunohisto-chemical study, the deparaffinized tissue sectionswere incubated with polyclonal (monospecific)antibodies against recombinant recoverin [4,5] (ina dilution of 1:100) as the first antibody. Immuno-peroxidase staining was applied to the specimensby the streptavidin\ufffd/biotin\ufffd/peroxidase-complex.Bovine retina sections were used as a positivecontrol of the reaction. The tumor cells werepositively stained with monoclonal antibodies tochromogranin (Dako) in a dilution of 1:200 and topancytokeratin (Immunotech) in a dilution of1:100, suggesting neuroendocrine characteristics(data not shown).3. ResultsThe first analysis of serum of the patient made inJune 1999 detected anti-Rc with a titre of 1:10(Fig. 1A). The second measurement in September2000 showed an increase of the titre up to 1:20(Fig. 1B). Thus, an amount of anti-Rc in thepatient\u2019s serum tends to increase with the tumorprogression. Normal human sera used as a negativecontrol contain anti-Rc (see Fig. 1). Exogeneousrecoverin as a competitor for anti-Rc binding torecoverin on the blot decreased the intensity of thereaction in an exogeneous recoverin-dependentmanner (not shown) what proves the specificityof the reaction.It is of interest to note that prednisoloneadministrated for the treatment of COPD exacer-bation in the patient caused a disappearance ofanti-Rc from the patient\u2019s blood stream 10 daysafter the treatment (see Fig. 1B), what was ratherdue to immunosupression by steroid therapy.It should be stressed that the patient had no lossof vision before the disease and during the wholeperiod of the observation. Detailed ophtalmologi-cal investigation of him performed in September2000 showed that the patient possessed normalvisual acuity, his retina and optic nerve werewithout any changes, the fundus picture remainedintact and the visual field was unchanged (Fig. 2).Hence, one may conclude that the patient had nomanifestation of the CAR-syndrome despite thepresence of anti-Rc in his serum. To our knowledge,this is the first report on the anti-Rc-positive casein a NSCLC patient in the absence of the CAR-syndrome.To present day expression of recoverin has beendemonstrated immunohistohemically for one case364 M.S. Savchenko et al.of SCLC only [18]. Whereas no immunohistochem-ical data have been obtained on expression of theprotein in NSCLC tumors. In the present study, weused polyclonal (monospecific) antibodies againstrecoverin for immunohistochemical detection ofrecoverin in the primary tumor of the NSCLCpatient. Fig. 3 shows the sections of the tumorstained with the antibodies. One can see in Fig. 3Athat some tumor cells give recoverin-positivereaction (brown color). At the same time thestaining is absent when the antibodies are omitted(Fig. 3B) or preadsorbed with recoverin (Fig. 3C).Thus, we can make a conclusion on specificity ofthe recoverin-positive reaction revealed.4. DiscussionParaneoplastic neurological syndromes asso-ciated with malignant tumors usually occur monthsor even years before the cancer has been detectedusing traditional diagnostic techniques [1] whatallows to consider the underlying autoantibodies asa promising tool for an early diagnostics of cancer.Our present study demonstrates that anti-Rc can bedetected in a NSCLC patient who has no CAR-syndrome. While paraneoplastic neurological syn-dromes are very rare [1], frequencies of theautoantibodies vary over a wide range: from 2 to4% for anti-Yo and anti-Ri [19] to about 20% for anti-Hu [20]. A frequency of anti-Rc in sera of patientswith SCLC was preliminary estimated as 10% [16],but no statistical data have yet been obtained onthe serum anti-Rc frequency in patients withNSCLC. That is why consequent steps of ourresearch are aimed at accumulation of statisticaldata to estimate the anti-Rc frequencies in sera ofpatients with NSCLC irrespective of the presence offten recoverin is expressed in tumors of patientswith lung cancers.Fig. 1 Immunoblotting of serum of the NSCLC patient.
