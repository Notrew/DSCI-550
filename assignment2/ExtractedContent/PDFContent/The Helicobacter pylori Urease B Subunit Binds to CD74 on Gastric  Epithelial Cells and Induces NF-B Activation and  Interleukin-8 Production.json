We have previously shown that H. pylori binds to CD74 on gastric epithelial cells. In this study,we sought to identify the bacterial protein responsible for this interaction. H. pylori urease from a pool ofbacterial surface proteins was found to coprecipitate with CD74. To determine how urease binds to CD74, weused recombinant urease A and B subunits. Recombinant urease B was found to bind directly to CD74 inimmunoprecipitation and flow cytometry studies. By utilizing both recombinant urease subunits and urease Bknockout bacteria, the urease B-CD74 interaction was shown to induce NF-\ufffdB activation and interleukin-8(IL-8) production. This response was decreased by blocking CD74 with monoclonal antibodies. Furtherconfirmation of the interaction of urease B with CD74 was obtained using a fibroblast cell line transfected withCD74 that also responded with NF-\ufffdB activation and IL-8 production. The binding of the H. pylori urease Bsubunit to CD74 expressed on gastric epithelial cells presents a novel insight into a previously unrecognizedH. pylori interaction that may contribute to the proinflammatory immune response seen during infection.Helicobacter pylori is one of the most widespread humanpathogens. Over 50% of the world\u2019s population are infected,with infection rates as high as 90% in developing countries.This pathogen is a major cause of chronic gastritis, gastric andduodenal ulcers, and gastric carcinomas (9, 24). Although in-fection of the gastric epithelium with H. pylori elicits a markedinflammatory responses and apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells(17, 25), the events that promote these responses are notclearly defined. H. pylori resides in the lumen of the gastricmucosa, in close association with gastric epithelial cells duringinfection (20, 43). Clearly, bacterial adhesion and colonizationof the gastric mucosa are key events in pathogenesis (45).An essential factor in H. pylori colonization of the gastricmucosa, which is also considered a major virulence factor, isurease (11, 12). Urease is perhaps the most abundant proteinmade by H. pylori, comprising \ufffd10% of the total bacterialprotein (10, 14). It hydrolyzes urea to generate ammonia andCO2, which aid in neutralizing hydrochloric acid and allow H.pylori to colonize the gastric mucosa. Urease-deficient H. pylorifailed to colonize the gastric mucosa in multiple studies withmice and gnotobiotic piglets (49). While much urease is foundin the cytoplasm of the bacteria (42), it has also been shown tobe present in association with the outer membrane (8, 41).Although the presence of surface-associated urease has beendebated, a plethora of studies have provided evidence that itexists on the bacterial surface or is released by the bacteria. Arecent study showed the presence of urease in sarcosine-insol-uble outer membrane fractions of H. pylori (1), while otherssuggested that autolysis is responsible for surface urease (10,30, 39). Some have also suggested that urease is secreted orreleased (18, 50). There is also an intriguing suggestion thaturease binds to lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial surface(22).In addition to the enzymatic role in hydrolyzing urease toammonia, urease has been suggested to play a role in thepathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulceration (34, 44). It wasshown to activate monocytes and to stimulate them to produceinflammatory cytokines (19). We have previously shown thaturease binds to class II major histocompatibility complex(MHC) and induces apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells (15).Evidence for a role of urease in contributing to the localresponse was obtained when Mongolian gerbils treated withurease inhibitors showed markedly less gastritis when infectedby H. pylori than untreated gerbils (37).As urease is known to interact with class II MHC, this studyexamined the interaction with the class II MHC-associatedinvariant chain, or CD74. CD74 is best known for its role inregulating the intracellular transport and functions of class IIMHC in antigen-presenting cells (13, 40), and a variety ofother functions for this molecule have recently been discov-ered. Cell surface expression of CD74 on a variety of cell typeshas been described (38, 51). There is also significant expressionon gastric epithelial cell surfaces, which is upregulated duringinflammation (6). CD74 has a long cytoplasmic tail that hasbeen implicated in signaling events. Several studies have shownthat signaling induced through CD74 plays a role in B-cellmaturation (31, 32) that acts though NF-\ufffdB activation. Werecently showed that H. pylori binding to CD74 stimulates theNF-\ufffdB signaling cascade that leads to interleukin-8 (IL-8) pro-duction (7). In another signaling role, macrophage migration* Corresponding author.

We demonstrate that urease B binds to CD74expressed on gastric epithelial cell surfaces, while the urease Asubunit, on the other hand, appears to bind to class II MHC.By utilizing both recombinant urease subunits and urease Bknockout bacteria, we have demonstrated that urease B up-regulates IL-8 production upon binding to CD74.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines. N87 human gastric carcinoma epithelial cells and Hs738.st/int hu-man fetal gastric epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type CultureCollection (Manassas, VA). P3HR1 B cells expressing CD74, but not class IIMHC (47), were obtained from Robert E. Humphreys (Antigen Express,Worcester, MA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. M1 human fibroblast cellstransfected with the RSV.2-p33 isoform of CD74 (M1-p33) or the RSV.2 vectoralone (28) were obtained from Eric Long (National Institutes of Health, Rock-ville, MD) and cultured in selective Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium with10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin.Bacterial cultures. H. pylori strains 43504 and 51B, which were clinical strainsisolated from Japanese patients with simple gastritis, were used in this study.Isogenic ureB mutants were constructed using strains 43504 and 51B as parentalstrains. For isogenic ureB mutants, portions of the genes were amplified by PCRand the amplified fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptSK(\ufffd)(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the BamHI site deleted in advance. Akanamycin resistance gene cassette (a gift from Rainer Haas, Max von Petten-kofer Institut, Munich, Germany) was inserted into the BamHI site of insertDNA for the ureB gene. The obtained plasmids (1 to 2 \ufffdg) were used forinactivation of chromosomal genes by natural transformation as previously de-scribed (21). Inactivation of the genes was confirmed by PCR amplificationfollowed by Southern blot hybridization. All strains were grown on blood agarplates (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at 37\u00b0C under microaerophilic condi-tions as previously described (2). Bacteria were transferred after 48 h intobrucella broth containing 10% fetal bovine serum and left for an additional 24 h.After centrifugation at 2,500 \ufffd g for 10 min, bacteria were resuspended in sterilephosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The number of bacteria per milliliter wasdetermined by measuring the absorbance (at 530 nm) with a spectrophotometer(DU-65; Becton Dickinson Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) and comparing thevalue to a standard curve generated by quantifying viable organisms from ali-quots of bacteria at various concentrations that were also assessed by absor-bance.Biotinylation of bacteria and urease. Bacterial strains, urease (Oravax, Cam-bridge, MA), and urease A and B subunits (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA)were biotinylated using the Fluoreporter cell surface biotinylation kit (F-20560;Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). According to the manufacturer, this reagent iscell membrane-impermeative biotin-XX sulfosuccinimidyl ester, an amine-reac-tive compound that is designed to label surface proteins of live cells. Bacteria andsubunits were then biotinylated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. H.pylori strains were lysed by sonication, and bacterial lysates were dialyzed over-night in PBS.Urease binding of immunoprecipitated CD74. P3HR1 cells (2 \ufffd 107) werelysed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% NP-40, 10%Na-deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) andwere centrifuged at 10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min to remove nuclei. Biotinylated bacte-rial surface proteins were added to cell lysates and rotated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Thelysate mixture was precleared with 10 \ufffdl of protein A/G beads (Santa CruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. CD74 was immunoprecipi-tated using protein A/G beads that were preincubated with BU-45 monoclonalantibody for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, beads were incubatedwith the lysate mixture of P3HR-1 cells and biotinylated bacterial surface pro-teins or urease subunits for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed four times, andthe bound CD74 was eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralizedimmediately. The bound material was eluted, and samples were run on sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellu-lose membrane, and incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (SantaCruz Biotechnology) to detect precipitated H. pylori proteins or urease subunitsby Western blot analysis.Attachment assays. Ten micrograms of biotinylated urease A or B subunitswas incubated with 2 \ufffd 105 gastric epithelial cells or fibroblast cells for 1 h atroom temperature. Some samples were incubated with the anti-CD74 monoclo-nal antibody MB-741 (Becton Dickinson) for 1 h prior to urease exposure or withan isotype control. After being washed with PBS, samples were incubated with 1\ufffdl of strepavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) (Becton Dickinson) for 30 min on ice.Samples incubated with only strepavidin-PE were used as negative controls.Samples were washed two more times and analyzed by flow cytometry on aFACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). H. pylori was stained with the redfluorochrome PKH26 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,washed multiple times with RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI. Bacteriawere washed and added to pelleted cells treated with medium or gamma inter-feron and with blocking or control antibodies where indicated. The cultures weretreated with a 30:1 ratio of bacteria to cells and incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C.Negative control samples consisted of cells treated with the wash from stained H.pylori to assess background staining of cells.I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. Cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated overnight withserum-free medium and stimulated with H. pylori for specified times. Cells wereremoved from plates by scraping and lysed as described for similar studies (37).Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting sampleswere run on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate gels for electrophoresis and transferredto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. The membranes were treatedFIG. 1.

Gastric epithelial cells or fibroblast transfectantswere incubated for 24 h with H. pylori (30:1 bacteria/cell ratio). The fibroblastcontrol cells, M1, and the CD74-transfected cells, M1-p33, were incubated withserum-free medium for 16 h before bacterial exposure because of high basal IL-8production. Some samples were incubated with anti-CD74 antibodies or isotypecontrol antibodies before exposure to H. pylori. Supernatants were harvested at24 h and analyzed using IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)(Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to compareIL-8 secretion from gamma interferon-treated and untreated cells exposed to H.pylori, CD74 cross-linking, or blocking anti-CD74 antibodies.Real-time PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNAisolation kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. The sample concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 260 nm,and RNA quality was determined on a 1% agarose gel. real-time reverse tran-scription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed according the Applied Biosystems two-step real-time RT-PCR protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Allreagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The RT reaction mixtureinclude random 2.5 \ufffdM hexamers, 500 \ufffdM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.4U/\ufffdl of the RNase inhibitors, 5.5 mM MgCl2, MultiScribe reverse transcriptase(3.125 U/\ufffdl) and its buffer, and 1 \ufffdg of cellular RNA. The RT mix was up to finalvolume of the 50 \ufffdl using RNase- and DNase-free H2O (Sigma). The RT stepwas performed using the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) according to the following protocol: 10 min at 25\u00b0C,60 min at 37\u00b0C, and 5 min at 95\u00b0C. The cDNA samples obtained were stored at\ufffd20\u00b0C (if necessary) and used for the PCR step. The PCR mix was preparedusing TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The Assays-on-Demand gene expression assay mix (Applied Biosystems) for human 18S rRNA,IL-8, or CD74 (a 20\ufffd mix of unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan MGB probe,6-carboxyfluorescein dye labeled) and 2 \ufffdl of cDNA were added to the PCR mix.The reaction was carried out in a 20-\ufffdl final volume using the GeneAmp 5700sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) according to the followingprotocol: 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C (1 cycle), and 15 s 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C(40 cycles). The negative controls were included in the RT real-time two-stepreaction. The endpoint used in real-time PCR quantification, CT, is defined asthe PCR cycle number that crosses the signal threshold. CT values range from 0to 40, with the latter number assumed to represent no product formation.Quantification of cytokine gene expression was performed using the comparativeCT method (Sequence Detector user bulletin 2; Applied Biosystems) and re-ported as the fold difference relative to the human 18S rRNA housekeepinggene.

H. pylori binding and IL-8 production results were compared by analysisof variance and considered significant if the P value was \ufffd0.05.RESULTSUrease B coprecipitates with CD74. Since we have previ-ously shown that H. pylori attaches to CD74 and that CD74plays a role in the inflammatory response seen in response toH. pylori (7), we sought to determine the bacterial adhesinresponsible for this interaction. To this end, H. pylori surfaceproteins were biotinylated before bacterial lysis by sonication.Bacterial lysates were mixed with lysates of P3HR1 cells, aB-cell line that was used to examine the interactions with CD74in the absence of class II MHC. This was crucial since class IIMHC can bind H. pylori proteins (15). CD74 was immunopre-cipitated along with bound biotinylated H. pylori surface pro-teins. Western blot analysis using avidin-HRP revealed astrong band at 68 kDa and a weak band at 27 kDa, similar tothe case for the urease control, as seen in Fig. 1A. Two addi-tional bands at high molecular weights were also coprecipi-tated. The presence of biotinylated urease coprecipitating withCD74 suggests that urease is on the surface of H. pylori, sinceonly surface proteins were biotinylated. In a similar experi-ment, recombinant urease, as well as urease A and urease Bsubunits, was biotinylated and mixed with P3HR1 cell lysates.Figure 1B illustrates that the recombinant urease B subunitcoprecipitated with CD74. A band for urease A is present onlywhen intact urease is used and not when the subunit is usedalone, suggesting that it does not bind independently to CD74.The H. pylori urease B subunit binds to cell surface-ex-pressed CD74. Biotinylated recombinant urease A and B sub-units were utilized in order to examine their attachment toCD74 on the surface of gastric epithelial cells or CD74-trans-fected fibroblast cells. The gastric cell lines N87 and HS738and the CD74-transfected fibroblast cell line M1-p33 wereincubated with subunits and stained with strepavidin-PE forflow cytometric analysis. Some samples were preincubated withanti-CD74, anti-class II MHC, or isotype control antibodies for1 hour prior to urease subunit exposure for blocking purposes.Figure 2A shows that urease B attached to HS-738, and theattachment was dramatically decreased upon pretreatmentwith anti-CD74 antibodies, while very little decrease was seenafter pretreatment with anti-class II MHC antibodies (Fig. 2B).CD74 blocking resulted in up to a 70% decrease in attachmentto gastric epithelial cells and CD74-transfected fibroblastscompared to cells treated with isotype control. Urease A at-tachment to gastric epithelial cells was decreased more than50% upon blocking class II MHC with monoclonal antibodies.Additionally, when CD74-transfected fibroblast cells were ex-amined, urease A attachment was much lower than urease Battachment, supporting the Western blot results where recom-binant urease A alone did not coprecipitate with CD74. Nei-ther subunit attached to the M1 parent fibroblast cell line,which did not express CD74 or class II MHC (not shown).In order to further examine urease B attachment to CD74,the attachment of H. pylori strains 43504 and 43504 and ureaseB knockouts to three cell lines was examined by flow cytom-etry. Bacteria were stained with PKH26 PE dye and incubatedwith gastric cells (N87 and HS738) or M1-p33 fibroblast cellsfor 90 min at 37\u00b0C. The urease B-deficient 51B strain bound toN87 and HS-738 cells 27% and 30% less then the wild type,respectively, and the urease B-deficient 43504 strain bound28% and 30% less than the wild type (Fig. 2C and D). Thedecreased attachment was significant, with P values of \ufffd0.05.The wild-type bacteria attached to the M1-p33 fibroblasts,while the urease B-deficient bacteria exhibited very little at-tachment to these cells. There was very little attachment of H.pylori strains to the M1 parent cell line in the absence of CD74(not shown). Examination of the attachment of recombinanturease B subunit or urease B knockout H. pylori strains togastric epithelial cells clearly demonstrates that urease can beused as an adhesin by H. pylori in binding to CD74.Urease B triggers I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. We have previouslyshown that H. pylori binding to CD74 and cross-linking CD74resulted in I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation leading to NF-\ufffdB activation (7).In this study, we sought to determine if urease binding to CD74is involved in these responses. Recombinant urease B subunitwas incubated with gastric epithelial cells for 20-min intervalsto observe I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. As seen in Fig. 3A, incubation ofFIG. 3. Urease engagement of CD74 on gastric epithelial cellscauses I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. (A) Urease B incubation with N87 cellsresulted in I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation at 40 min shown in a representativeresult with a tubulin-\ufffd loading control. (B) Preincubation of cells withanti-CD74 antibodies blocked I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation as shown in a repre-sentative result with a tubulin-\ufffd control. (C) Incubation of N87 cellswith H. pylori strain 43504 led to I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation at 40 min as shownin a representative result with N87 cells with a tubulin-\ufffd control.(D) Incubation of cells with an H. pylori 43504 urease knockout de-creased I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation.VOL. 74, 2006 H. PYLORI UREASE B BINDS TO CD74 1151recombinant urease B alone with N87 cells resulted in I\ufffdB\ufffddegradation at 40 and 60 min, and its expression was restoredat 80 min. The tubulin control was utilized in order to dem-onstrate that equal protein concentrations were loaded intoeach well. When cells were preincubated with anti-CD74 an-tibodies, very little I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation was seen in response tourease B exposure (Fig. 3B). Similarly, when wild-type H. pyloriwas incubated with N87 cells, I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation was visible at40 and 60 min (Fig. 3C), but when the urease B knockoutbacteria were used, the I\ufffdB\ufffd bands are more visible (Fig. 3D).Interestingly, the kinetics of I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation induced by ure-ase B alone are comparable to those induced by H. pylori (Fig.3A and C). These results are consistent with our previous datashowing a decrease in I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation in cells exposed to H.pylori upon blocking of CD74 (7).Urease B triggers IL-8 production by binding to CD74. SinceH. pylori binding to CD74 results in IL-8 production, we soughtto determine whether urease B binding to CD74 alone leads toIL-8 production. N87, HS-738, and M1-p33 fibroblast cellswere exposed to recombinant urease A or urease B subunits toassess IL-8 responses. IL-8 ELISAs were used to quantify theamounts of IL-8 produced by the various cells. As shown inFig. 4A and B, recombinant urease B alone led to cell re-sponses up to three times higher than basal levels of IL-8 withall three cell lines examined at 24 h. The urease A subunit ledto very small increases in IL-8 production. Preincubating cellswith anti-CD74 antibodies decreased IL-8 production in re-sponse to urease B to levels similar to those after treatmentwith an isotype control with M1-p33 cells and drastically de-creased levels with gastric epithelial cells, although these werestill slightly above control levels. Anti-class II MHC antibodieshad little effect on IL-8 levels induced by the urease B subunit.Cells were also incubated with H. pylori strains 51B and 43504and their urease B knockout counterparts to assess their abilityto stimulate IL-8 production by gastric epithelial cells andM1-p33 CD74-transfected fibroblast cells. Figure 4C and Dshow that significantly less (P \ufffd 0.05) IL-8 (approximately 35%decreased production) is produced by the cells exposed tourease B knockout strains than by those exposed to wild-typebacteria. This response is especially apparent with M1-p33cells, where CD74 appears to be the principal receptor for H.pylori.In order to determine whether the observed IL-8 responseby these cells to urease B involved increased transcript expres-sion, real-time PCR was utilized to quantitate mRNA levels.As shown in Fig. 5A, incubation with recombinant urease B ledto fourfold, ninefold, and fivefold increases in IL-8 mRNA forN87, HS738, and M1-p33, respectively. Blocking with anti-CD74 antibodies led to at least 50% reduced mRNA levelscompared to those in cells treated with an isotype control.Urease A incubation resulted in very little increase in IL-8mRNA. Similarly, H. pylori incubation led to even larger in-creases in IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 5B), while urease B knockoutstrains still induced IL-8 mRNA but at reduced levels com-pared to wild-type bacteria.FIG. 4. Urease B engagement of CD74 on multiple cell types induces IL-8 production as measured by ELISA. Urease subunit incubation withN87 cells resulted in very little increase in IL-8 production with urease A subunit but a significant increase with urease B subunit at 24 h, whichwas decreased upon blocking CD74 with monoclonal antibodies but not when blocking class II MHC with (A) N87 and M1-p33 cells and (B) HS738cells. H. pylori strains 51B and 43504 induced IL-8 production, while urease B knockouts induced significantly less IL-8 with (C) N87 and M1-p33cells and (D) HS738 cells. The means and standard errors of the means are shown as the results of duplicates in four experiments (n \t 8).1152 BESWICK ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.Urease B increases CD74 surface expression on gastriccells. We have previously shown that CD74 surface expressionis upregulated by IL-8 production and H. pylori infection (6). Inorder to investigate whether urease B plays a role in thisincreased CD74 expression, surface expression was measuredby flow cytometry and the corresponding mRNA levels wereassessed by real-time PCR. Figure 6A demonstrates that ure-ase B incubation led to a notable increase in CD74 surfaceexpression, while urease A incubation led to very little changein expression. Gastric epithelial cells exposed to H. pylori alsoresulted in an upregulation of CD74 expression, while theurease B knockout strain led to lower expression levels thanthe wild type (Fig. 6B). Similar results were observed withmRNA levels, where urease B induced increases in CD74mRNA of threefold and fivefold for N87 and HS738, respec-tively, while H. pylori induced a fivefold increase for N87 and asevenfold increased for HS738. The urease B knockout strainled to only a two- to threefold increase for both cell lines.FIG. 5. Urease B engagement of CD74 on multiple cell types leadsto increased IL-8 mRNA production as measured by real-time PCR.(A) Urease subunit incubation with N87 cells resulted in very littleincrease in IL-8 mRNA with urease A subunit but significant increaseswith urease B subunit at 24 h, which was decreased upon blockingCD74 with monoclonal antibodies with N87, M1-p33, and HS738 cells.(B) H. pylori strains 51B and 43504 increased IL-8 mRNA, whileurease B knockouts induced significantly less IL-8 mRNA, in N87,M1-p33, and HS738 cells.

PYLORI UREASE B BINDS TO CD74 1153Because urease B and H. pylori bind to CD74, this upregulationmay be important to enhance the binding of bacteria and inpromoting the associated pathogenesis.DISCUSSIONAs one of the major virulence factors of H. pylori, urease hasbeen utilized in clinical aspects, from detection of infection tovaccine development studies. In animal models, it has beenshown to be required for colonization of the gastric mucosa(11, 12, 49) and has been demonstrated as a successful vaccine(16, 46). H. pylori is known to activate professional antigen-presenting cells and play an important role in inflammatoryresponses elicited by these cells during H. pylori infection, andurease alone has been shown to activate these cells (18, 19, 29).Studies with gastric epithelial cells have suggested that ureaseis toxic to them (44) and leads to increased cell death (15).Urease has also been shown to induce proinflammatory re-sponses from gastric epithelial cells, which may lead to thepathogenesis seen in gastritis and peptic ulcers (35, 48).Clearly, urease plays an important role in the inflammatoryresponse triggered by H. pylori and in the associated tissuedamage.Gastric epithelial cells have been suggested to be nonpro-fessional antigen-presenting cells and express high levels ofclass II MHC and CD74 on the cell surface (3, 7). AlthoughCD74 is best known for its role in regulating the intracellularbiology of class II MHC molecules, CD74 has recently beensuggested to have functions independent of class II MHC. Onerecently discovered function for CD74 is its role as a receptorfor macrophage migration Inhibitory factor. MIF binding toCD74 leads to signaling events such as extracelluar signal reg-ulated kinase activation, cell proliferation, and prostaglandinE2 production (27, 33). Other studies have indicated thatCD74 is required for signaling that induces B-cell maturation(31, 33). In B cells, MIF binding to CD74 results in activationof transcription factors, including NF-\ufffdB, which is an impor-tant control in immune and inflammatory responses (26). Thevariety of functions and signaling leading to immune responsesthat have recently implicated CD74 in initiating signaling pro-cesses suggests that there is much more to be revealed aboutthe functions of this molecule.We have previously shown that H. pylori utilizes gastric ep-ithelial cell surface-expressed CD74 as a point of attachment(7). We have also shown that urease binds to class II MHC(15). In this study, we expanded upon these findings to discoverthat urease B binds to CD74, while urease A appears to havea higher affinity for class II MHC. Recent studies have shownurease to be among surface proteins in the sarcosine-insolubleouter membrane fraction of H. pylori (1). We further demon-strated that urease appears to be among the H. pylori surfaceproteins because it was biotinylated before live bacterial lysisby sonication. Many studies have attributed surface urease tobacterial autolysis (30, 39), so it is probable that the urease inour biotinylated outer membrane proteins can be attributed toautolysis as well. The importance of surface-associated ureasewas demonstrated in one study where H. pylori did not survivein acidic conditions in the absence of surface-associated urease(23). Studies by Icatlo et al. have shown that urease bindssulfated polysaccharides (22), and we have shown that class IIMHC-associated CD74 has an important chondroitin sulfate-modified isoform (4) that may play a role in urease binding andshould be further investigated.Similar to professional antigen-presenting cells, gastric epi-thelial cells respond to H. pylori with comparable cytokineprofiles (5, 48). H. pylori urease B similarly elicits a Th1 re-sponse from antigen-presenting cells (19, 35). In this study, wehave shown that urease B represents a ligand for CD74, whichleads NF-\ufffdB activation and IL-8 production. N87 cells, HS-738cells, and M1-p33 CD74-transfected fibroblast cells, which ex-hibit very little response when transfected with the vectoralone, all responded in the same way to urease treatment, andthat response was negated by blocking CD74 with specificantibodies. In contrast, recombinant urease A did not bind wellto M1-p33 CD74-tranfected fibroblasts and did not stimulatethem to produce IL-8. Together, these observations suggestthat urease A probably attaches to class II MHC and couldthen be in involved in the induction of apoptosis, as we dem-onstrated in a previous study (15).The interaction of urease B with CD74 and the elevatedresponses were further examined using urease B-deficientstrains compared to parental strains. Decreases were seen inattachment and IL-8 responses with the urease B mutantscompared to the wild-type strains. Because there are multiplereceptors for H. pylori and there are multiple virulence factorsthat induce IL-8 production (36), attachment and induction ofIL-8 were still observed with the urease B-deficient bacteria;however, significant decreases in both were observed. Thesestudies suggest that urease plays a role specifically in the at-tachment of and proinflammatory immune response initiatedby H. pylori. While the coprecipitation studies showed that twohigh-molecular-weight proteins, in addition to the urease sub-units, were coprecipitated by CD74, their identities are atpresent unknown. However, they are present in lower quanti-ties than urease subunits. They could be proteins that binddirectly to CD74 or that coassociate with H. pylori urease.Urease encompasses an even broader role than previouslytheorized in the pathogenesis associated with infection of H.pylori and should not be overlooked. Although urease is knownfor its enzymatic activity, the dual function as an adhesion andimmunogen should not be surprising since bacteria containgenes involved in a wide range of physiological processes, per-haps as an mechanism for adaptation to an ample array ofgrowth conditions.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grantsDK50669 and DK56338.
