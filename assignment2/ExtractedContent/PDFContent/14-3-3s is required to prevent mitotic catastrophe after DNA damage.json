Kinzler & Bert VogelsteinThe Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Program in Human Genetics, and TheHoward Hughes Medical Institute, The Johns Hopkins University School ofMedicine, 424 N. Bond Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA................. ......................... ......................... ......................... ......................... .........................14-3-3s is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cellularactivity by binding and sequestering phosphorylated proteins. Ithas been suggested that 14-3-3s promotes pre-mitotic cell-cyclearrest following DNA damage, and that its expression can becontrolled by the p53 tumour suppressor gene1. Here we describean improved approach to the generation of human somatic-cellknockouts, which we have used to generate human colorectalcancer cells in which both 14-3-3j alleles are inactivated. AfterDNA damage, these cells initially arrested in the G2 phase of thecell cycle, but, unlike cells containing 14-3-3s, the 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cellswere unable to maintain cell-cycle arrest. The 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cells died(\u2018mitotic catastrophe\u2019) as they entered mitosis. This process wasassociated with a failure of the 14-3-3s-deficient cells to sequesterthe proteins (cyclin B1 and cdc2) that initiate mitosis and preventthem from entering the nucleus. These results may indicate amechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventingmitotic death.Many cell types treated with DNA-damaging agents arrest in theG2 phase of the cell cycle. The 14-3-3j gene is transcriptionallyactivated by p53 after DNA damage, and exogenous overexpressionof 14-3-3s can block cells in G2, indicating that 14-3-3s might be acomponent of the G2 checkpoint1. To test this hypothesis, wecreated cell lines deficient in 14-3-3s by homologous recombina-tion. The human 14-3-3j genomic locus was cloned and fullysequenced, and subclones were used to construct a targetingvector containing a geneticin-resistance gene in place of genomic14-3-3j sequences. Two loxP sites were introduced into the con-struct, one immediately 59 and the other directly 39 to the geneticin-resistance gene. A primer site for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)derived from deleted genomic sequences was placed between the 59loxP site and the 59 end of the selection marker2. The two loxP sitesand the primer-containing construct enabled a relatively rapid androbust approach to screening clones for correctly targeted alleles,and for sequentially generating clones with both alleles disrupted(see Methods).The human colorectal cancer cell (CRC) line HCT116 was usedfor these experiments because it expresses wild-type p53 and14-3-3s, has intact DNA-damage checkpoints and is suitable fortargeted homologous recombination3. Two independently derived14-3-3s+/\u2212 and three 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 clones were used for the studiesdescribed below (Fig. 1a\u2013c). All clones of the same genotypebehaved identically.We investigated the function of 14-3-3s in human cells followingDNA damage by adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeuticagent, as well as by ionizing radiation. The disruption of 14-3-3shad a marked effect on the responses of the cells to these agents.After either treatment, 14-3-3s+/+ and 14-3-3s+/\u2212 cells increased insize, with a corresponding nuclear enlargement and DNA contentcharacteristic of cells arrested in G2 (Fig. 2a). Although 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212cells appeared to enter into a similar G2 block following DNAdamage, they failed to maintain this arrest and eventually under-went \u2018mitotic catastrophe\u2019 (Fig. 2a). Mitotic catastrophe is anapoptosis-like process than begins in prophase, after dissolutionof the nuclear membrane, and is associated with the entry of cdc2and cyclin B1 into the nucleus4,5. This process began ,24 h after\u00a9 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltdletters to natureNATURE | VOL 401 | 7 OCTOBER 1999 | www.nature.com 617treatment and was complete after 72\u201396 h (Fig. 3a). Althoughchromatin condensation and micronucleation occurred duringmitotic catastrophe, this process was distinguished from morecommon forms of apoptosis by a relative lack of DNA degradation,indicated by both DNA laddering (not shown) and TdT-mediateddUTp nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining for nicked DNA(compare with ceramide-induced apoptosis in Fig. 2b).Roughly 75% of parental cells and 14-3-3s+/\u2212 heterozygote cellsarrested after DNA damage with a G2 DNA content, whereas theremaining 25% of cells arrested in G1 (Fig. 3b). A similar fraction(,25%) of 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cells arrested in G1, but a relative decrease inthe G2 fraction was evident as early as 24 h after adriamycintreatment (Fig. 3b). At later times, the 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cells showed amarked decrease in cells arrested in G2 and a corresponding increasein the number of sub-G1 cells, whereas the fraction of G2-arrestedcells remained constant in both 14-3-3s+/+ and 14-3-3s+/\u2212 cells(Fig. 3b). The number of G1-arrested cells remained constant incells of all three genotypes, indicating that the cells were probablyundergoing catastrophe directly from the G2/M phase rather thanfrom all parts of the cell cycle.To study the expression of 14-3-3s following DNA damage, wegenerated an antibody specific for 14-3-3s using an amino-acidsequence found in 14-3-3s but not in the other six 14-3-3 familymembers. The specificity of this antibody was verified by thedetection of a protein of the expected size upon western blottingof parental cells treated with DNA-damaging agents but not of14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 1d). The 14-3-3s protein was induced as earlyas 6 h after exposure to adriamycin, with kinetics similar to those ofthe p53-induced gene p21 in the same cells (Fig. 3c).The 14-3-3s antibody was used to study the protein in situ.There was no detectable staining in most exponentially growing14-3-3s+/+ cells, although a small population of large cells stainedFigure 1 Generation of human cells deficient in 14-3-3s. a, Genomic structure of thehuman 14-3-3j gene and targeting construct.

After expression of cre recombinase to excise the selectioncassette, the same targeting construct was used to disrupt the second 14-3-3s allele.Primer site B and an EcoRV site were incorporated directly upstream of the neomycin-resistance gene.

The size and morphology of the cells expressing14-3-3s in the absence of DNA damage suggested that they werearrested in G2 and perhaps senescent. When cells were treated withg-ionizing radiation or adriamycin, all the cells expressed 14-3-3s(Fig. 3d). As expected, 14-3-3s\u2212/\u2212 cells did not stain for 14-3-3seither before or after treatment with adriamycin (Fig. 3d), confirm-ing the specificity of the antibodies for immunohistochemicalanalysis.A key step in regulating the progression of cells from G2 intomitosis is the activation of the protein kinase cdc2 (ref. 6). Cdc2 andcyclin B1 are cytoplasmic during interphase and are translocated tothe nucleus in late G2 to initiate mitosis4,7. The DNA damagecheckpoint prevents the activation of cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 complexesand thereby prevents cells from entering a potentially lethalmitosis when their DNA is damaged8. When we treated parentalcells or 14-3-3s+/\u2212 cells with adriamycin or ionizing radiation, cdc2and cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm throughout the durationof the experiment (Fig. 4a). In identically treated 14-3-3s-deficientcells, cdc2 and cyclin B1 were initially cytoplasmic, as in the parentalcells; however, cdc2 and cyclin B1 soon migrated to the nucleus inmost of the cells, and mitotic catastrophes occurred soon after(Fig. 4a, b). Normally, the entry of cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25C intothe nucleus occurs simultaneously4; however, cdc25C remainedlocalized in the cytoplasm before nuclear-membrane dissolution,despite the fact that cyclin B1 and cdc2 were in the nucleus (Fig. 4a).Double-staining with antibodies specific for cdc2 and 14-3-3s inDNA-damaged cells revealed a striking colocalization of the twoproteins in the cytoplasm of parental cells (Fig. 4c). This mayindicate that 14-3-3s normally sequesters cyclin B1 and cdc2 in thecytoplasm, keeping cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 from entering the nucleus andinitiating mitosis following DNA damage. To investigate the mole-cular determinants of this sequestration, we carried out immuno-precipitation experiments using anti-14-3-3s antibodies. Westernblots of the immunoprecipitates showed that cdc2 and cyclinB1were bound to 14-3-3s, and that this binding markedly increasedfollowing adriamycin treatment (Fig. 4d; and data not shown).Wee1 kinase was also found in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4d); ithas already been shown that cdc2 and cyclin B1 can bind to eachother, and that wee1 binds to cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 (ref. 9). No cdc25Ccould be detected (Fig. 4d), indicating that other 14-3-3 familymembers, but not 14-3-3s, may be responsible for the reportedcdc25C interactions10.Thus, it appears that 14-3-3s normally sequesters cdc2\u2013cyclinB1complexes in the cytoplasm during G2 arrest, and that the absenceof 14-3-3s eventually allows cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 complexes to enter thenucleus, resulting in mitotic catastrophe. This idea is consistentwith several previous experiments which show that the cytoplasmiclocalization of cdc2\u2013cyclinB1 is a critical regulator of the G2/Mtransition8, and that mitotic catastrophes occur if mitosis is experi-mentally induced in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA4.Our results also support the idea that the initiation of G2 arrest isdistinct from its maintenance11. Notably, we observed identicalmitotic catastrophes in DNA-damaged parental cells after treatingthem with leptomycin B, an agent that inhibits nuclear export andresults in a similar lack of cytoplasmic sequestration of cdc2\u2013cyclinB1 (data not shown). These results, in combination with previousstudies, suggest a simple but redundant set of mechanisms forpreventing lethal mitosis following exposure of cells to DNA-Figure 3 Cells deficient in 14-3-3s are sensitive to DNA-damage. a, Cells with theindicated 14-3-3s genotypes were treated with adriamycin for various time periods,stained with DAPI and scored for chromosome condensation.

Chk1 inactivates cdc25C through phos-phorylation of serine 216 and consequent binding to 14-3-3proteins. The cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 complex is thereby prevented frombecoming activated and initiating mitosis, and the cells arrest in G2.Although this arrest is initiated in cells without 14-3-3s or withoutp21, the arrest cannot be sustained. The 14-3-3s protein is normallyin a cytoplasmic complex with cdc2 during G2 arrest, and localiza-tion is dependent both on 14-3-3s (Fig. 4) and on continuednuclear transport by the crm1-dependent nuclear-export com-plex12\u201314. In the absence of either 14-3-3s or nuclear transport,cdc2 and cyclin B1 escape to the nucleus and initiate a catastrophicmitotic process4.

The G2/M checkpoint isinitiated by the phosphorylation of chk1 by rad3 family members (such as ATM inmammalian cells)20. Chk1 then inactivates cdc25C through phosphorylation of serine216, which leads to the binding of cdc25C to a 14-3-3 protein (not 14-3-3s) and to itsexportation out of the nucleus15. The cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 complex is thereby prevented frombecoming activated and initiating mitosis, and the cells arrest in G2. DNA damage alsoleads to stabilization of p53, which is required for maintenance of the G2 arrest throughthe transactivation of the p21 and 14-3-3j genes. 14-3-3s is required to sequestercdc2\u2013cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm and prevent mitotic catastrophes. p21 mayprevent any cdc2\u2013cyclin B1 that enters the nucleus from becoming activated.\u00a9 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltdletters to nature620 NATURE | VOL 401 | 7 OCTOBER 1999 | www.nature.comensure that mitosis does not occur in the presence of DNA damage,one by sequestering cdc25C15 and the other by sequestering cdc2\u2013cyclin B1. It is becoming apparent that it is not only the enzymaticactivities of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes but also their spatialcompartmentalization that is critical for proper control of the cellcycle5. MMethods14-3-3s targeting constructA BAC clone containing 14-3-3s was obtained as described1. The BAC clone was digestedwith BamHI, and two fragments, one 4.7 kilobases (kb) and the second 3.8 kb, were used toconstruct the 59 and 39 arms of the targeting vector, respectively. The 4.7-kb subclonecontained the region immediately 59 of the initiating codon of the 14-3-3s coding region.The 3.8-kb subclone contained a region beginning 900 base pairs (bp) distal to theinitiating codon. A synthetic EcoRV site plus the sequence 59-CGTGGAGAGGGACTGGCAG-39, derived from a region of the 14-3-3s locus deleted by the targeting construct,were ligated to the 59 end of a geneticin-resistance gene. This product was placed into thepBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). To facilitate knockout of both alleles, loxP sitessurrounding the geneticin-resistance gene were incorporated into the vector. Details of theconstructs are available upon request. The construct was linearized by digestion with NotIand used for transfection. Southern blot analysis was carried out using standardtechniques.Cell culture and transfectionHCT116 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). TheHCT116 p21\u2212/\u2212 line has been described3. Cells were cultured in McCoy\u2019s mediumsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). We carried out transfections withLipofectamine as directed by the manufacturer (Gibco). Clonal selection followingtransfection with the knockout construct was carried out in McCoy\u2019s medium with 10%fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg ml\u22121 geneticin (Gibco). Following transfection, cells werediluted in selection media and plated out in 96-well plates. After selection, we preparedgenomic DNA from the drug-resistant clones using the QiaAmp column system (Qiagen).Identification of clones with successful targeting events was achieved using a PCR-basedscreen with the primers 59-AGTGTCCTGGGATCTCCAGC-39 and 59-CTGCCAGTCCCTCTCCACG-39 and Taq Platinum (Gibco). PCR products were resolved by electrophor-esis in 1% agarose gels. Knockout clones were confirmed by Southern blot and westernblot analysis. Irradiation was performed using a 137Cs g-irradiator at 1 Gy min\u22121 for12 min. Adriamycin was used at a concentration of 0.2 mg ml\u22121 (ref. 16). Leptomycin B wasa gift from M. Yoshida. Time-lapse microscopy was done as described17.Flow cytometryCells were trypsinized, washed with HBSS (Gibco) and resuspended in 40 ml HBSS. Thecells were then added to 360 ml of a solution containing 1% NP-40 (Sigma), 4.7%formaldehyde (J. T. Baker), and 11 mg ml\u22121 Hoechst 33258 in PBS. The fixed and stainedcells were stored at 4 8C and analysed within three days by flow cytometry.Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysisImmunoprecipitations were performed as described9,18. 14-3-3s antibody was conjugatedto beads using an Affi-Gel kit (Bio-Rad). Samples of protein from equivalent numbers ofcells were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex). The proteins were thentransferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) and incubated with either the p53-specific DO1monoclonal antibody, the p21-specific EA10 monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), a 14-3-3s-specific polyclonal antibody, anti-cdc2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-wee1antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-cdc25C antibody (Santa Cruz). Polyclonal antibodiesagainst 14-3-3s were generated in rabbits using a KLH-conjugate of the peptideSNEEGSEEKGPEV and were affinity purified using the same conjugate. The membraneswere then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the appro-priate horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Jackson Labs). Proteins werevisualized with ECL (Pierce).ImmunohistochemistryCells were rinsed twice with PBS and then fixed with Histochoice (Amresco), permeabi-lized with 1% NP40 in PBS, and blocked in goat serum for 1 h. Antibodies specific for cdc2,cyclin B, cdk4, cyclin D, a-tubulin (all from Santa Cruz), 14-3-3s (generated as describedabove) and p21 (Calbiochem) were applied in GT (goat serum containing 0.05% Tween20). After washing in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), fluorochrome-labelled secondaryantibody (Molecular Probes) was applied in GT for 1 h. Cells were washed for 5 min inPBST 3 times. In some cases, cells were counterstained with 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole(DAPI). Slides were mounted in DAPCO/glycerol and analysed with a Nikon Eclipse E800microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics). Images were pseudocolouredusing the software program IPLab (Signal Analytics Cooperation). TUNEL analysis wasperformed as described19.
