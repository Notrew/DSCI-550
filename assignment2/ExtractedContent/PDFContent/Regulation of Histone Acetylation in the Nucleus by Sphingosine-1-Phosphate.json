R. China4 National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USAAbstractThe pleiotropic lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can act intracellularly independentlyof its cell surface receptors through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), one ofthe isoenzymes that generates S1P, was associated with histone H3 and produced S1P that regulatedhistone acetylation. S1P specifically bound to the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 andinhibited their enzymatic activity, preventing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues withinhistone tails. SphK2 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in repressor complexes and was selectivelyenriched at the promoters of the genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or thetranscriptional regulator c-fos, where it enhanced local histone H3 acetylation and transcription.Thus, HDACs are direct intracellular targets of S1P and link nuclear S1P to epigenetic regulation ofgene expression.Phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolites have established roles in signal transductionpathways initiated by activation of cell surface receptors. The recent identification of nuclearlipid metabolism has highlighted a new signaling paradigm for phospholipids. The bestcharacterized of the intranuclear lipids are the inositol lipids that have critical roles in nuclearfunctions, such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, transcriptional regulation, andchromatin remodeling (1). Sphingomyelin has long been known to be a component of thenuclear matrix (2), but the possibility that sphingolipids are also metabolized within the nucleushas only recently emerged from observations that enzymes controlling sphingolipidmetabolism, including neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramidase, are also present in thenucleus (3).*To whom correspondence should be addressed. sspiegel@vcu.edu.Supporting Online Materialwww.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5945/1254/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs.

Most of its actions are mediated bybinding to a family of five heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, designated S1P1\u20135 (5). S1P may also function inside the cell independentlyof S1P receptors (4); however, direct intracellular targets of S1P have not been identified. Sincethe discovery that S1P is produced intracellularly by two closely related sphingosine kinaseisoenzymes, SphK1 and SphK2, much has been learned about SphK1 and its functions, yetthose of SphK2 remain enigmatic (7).Because, in many cells, SphK2 is mainly localized to the nucleus or can shuttle between thecytosol and the nucleus in accordance with its nuclear localization and export signals (8), wesought to determine its function there (9). In human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, SphK2 ispredominantly localized to the nucleus (10), where it is enzymatically active and can produceS1P from sphingosine (Fig. 1A). The nucleus contained high amounts of sphingosine (tableS1), and SphK2 expression significantly increased nuclear abundance of S1P by sixfold anddihydro-S1P, which lacks the trans double bond at the 4 position, by twofold (Fig. 1A).Endogenous SphK2 was mainly associated with isolated chromatin and was not detected inthe nucleoplasm (Fig. 1B). SphK2 was present in purified mononucleosomes fractionated bysucrose density gradient centrifugation, and its distribution paralleled that of native histones(fig. S1A). Thus, we tested whether SphK2 was associated with core histone proteins.Immunoprecipitation of proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from MCF-7 cellsoverexpressing SphK2 or SphK1 and subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated thathistone 3 (H3) was associated with SphK2 (Fig. 1C), but not with SphK1. H3 was alsocoimmunoprecipitated with catalytically inactive SphK2G212E (in which glycine 212 isreplaced by glutamic acid) (Fig. 1C), which does not increase nuclear S1P (4.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 4.6\u00b1 0.6 pmol/mg for vector and SphK2G212E, respectively); these findings suggest that enzymaticactivity is not required for association of these two proteins. H3 from nuclear extracts alsoassociated with histidine (His)\u2013tagged SphK2 isolated with Ni2+\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)\u2013agarose beads (fig. S1B). To further confirm the specificity of the physical interaction of SphK2with H3, we measured in vitro association of Ni-NTA-agarose\u2013bound His-tagged SphK2 orHis-SphK1 with individually purified histones. Only H3, but not histones H4, H2B, or H2A,bound to SphK2 (fig. S1C). In contrast, none of the purified histones interacted with SphK1(fig. S1C).We noticed that expression of SphK2 increased acetylation of lysine 9 of H3 (H3-K9), lysine5 of histone H4 (H4-K5), and lysine 12 of histone H2B (H2B-K12) (Fig. 2A), without affectingacetylation of other lysines or acetylation of histone H2A. In contrast, expression ofcatalytically inactive SphK2G212E (Fig. 2A) or SphK1 did not influence acetylation of anyresidues examined. Although catalytically inactive SphK2G212E also bound to H3 (Fig. 1C),it did not affect its acetylation status (Fig. 2A), which correlated with the formation of S1P inthe nucleus with histone acetylation. Addition of S1P or dihydro-S1P, which can both beproduced intranuclearly by SphK2 (Fig. 2D), to isolated nuclei also increased specificacetylations of the same lysine residues on histones H3, H4, and H2B without causingacetylation of H2A (Fig. 2B).All these results indicate that SphK2 in the nucleus regulates histone acetylation. Depletion ofSphK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. 2C) reduced nuclear but not cytoplasmicamounts of S1P and dihydro-S1P (Fig. 2D), consistent with the specificity of SphK2 for bothsphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (11). As expected from its cytosolic localization, siRNAtargeted to SphK1 (siSphK1) only reduced amounts of S1P in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). siSphK2specifically decreased acetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5, and H2B-K12, without affectingacetylation of other lysines or acetylation of H2A (Fig. 2C). In contrast, depletion of SphK1Hait et al. Page 2Science. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 7.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscripthad no significant effect on acetylation of these histone residues (Fig. 2C). Similar results wereobtained with siRNAs targeted to different sequences in SphK2. Addition of S1P to isolatednuclei reversed the decreased acetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5, and H2B-K12 induced bydepletion of SphK2 (fig. S2A). siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous SphK2 (fig. S2B),but not that of overexpressed V5-SphK2 (fig. S2C), decreased acetylation of particular histoneresidues (fig. S2C), which could be reversed by cotransfection with a siRNA-insensitive V5-SphK2 construct (fig. S2C). Together, these observations indicate that S1P produced in thenucleus by endogenous SphK2 acts there to regulate histone acetylation.Lysine acetylation of histones is a critical component of an epigenetic indexing systemdemarcating transcriptionally active chromatin domains. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)and histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain the delicate, dynamic equilibrium in acetylationlevels of nucleosomal histones (12,13). Neither S1P nor dihydro-S1P increased HAT activityin HeLa cell nuclear extracts, nor did overexpression of SphK2 (fig. S3). In sharp contrast, S1Pand dihydro-S1P inhibited HDAC activity in nuclear extracts by 50%, compared with 95%inhibition by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (fig. S4A). Conversely, siSphK2, whichreduced SphK2 expression by 70% in HeLa cells without affecting SphK1 expression (fig.S4C), enhanced HDAC activity (fig. S4B). This increased HDAC activity was not due toincreased abundance of HDAC1 or HDAC2 (fig. S4D). We also assessed the effect of S1P onenzymatic activity of endogenous HDACs. S1P inhibited the enzymatic activity ofimmunoprecipitated HDAC1 (Fig. 3A) and HDAC2 (fig. S4E) almost as effectively as didTSA. Both S1P and dihydro-S1P also inhibited recombinant HDAC1 (Fig. 3B) and HDAC2(fig. S4F). However, neither sphingosine nor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), another bioactivelysophospholipid structurally related to S1P, had significant effects on HDAC1 (Fig. 3B) orHDAC2 activity (fig. S4F). Thus, S1P and dihydro-S1P appear to be endogenous inhibitors ofHDAC. To provide further evidence that HDACs are targets for S1P, we examined binding ofendogenous HDACs in nuclear extracts to S1P immobilized on agarose beads. Both HDAC1and HDAC2 were associated with matrices carrying S1P but not by control or LPA matrices(Fig. 3C). In contrast, other class I HDACs (HDAC3, HDAC8), class IIa HDACs (HDAC4,HDAC5, HDAC7), class IIb HDAC (HDAC6), and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NAD+)\u2013dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 did not bind to S1P agarose beads (fig.S5). 32P-labeled S1P specifically bound to either His-tagged HDAC1 or HDAC2 immobilizedon Ni-NTA-agarose beads and was displaced by excess unlabeled S1P (fig. S6). Modeling ofS1P into the active site of the HDAC1 homolog from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifexaeolicus (14) revealed that it docks well (fig. S7), with a predicted binding energy comparableto that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (fig. S7), a potent inhibitor of HDACs.Indeed, both SAHA and TSA completely displaced bound [32P]S1P from HDAC1 anddecreased binding to HDAC2 to a similar extent, as did excess unlabeled S1P (fig. S6). Todetermine whether endogenous S1P is bound to nuclear HDAC1, we measured the abundanceof sphingolipids in HDAC1 immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts by mass spectrometry.Of all the sphingolipids present in the nucleus, only S1P was bound to HDAC1 (Fig. 3D andtable S1). Thus, S1P can bind to the active site of HDAC1 and HDAC2 and inhibit their activity.HDAC1 and HDAC2 are catalytically active components of distinct multiprotein co-repressorcomplexes that include Sin3 and NuRD. Over-expressed SphK2 associated with proteins ofthese co-repressor complexes, mSin3A and MBD2/3, and with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (fig.S8A). Endogenous SphK2 also associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 and interacted withhistone H3 (fig. S8B). These results place SphK2, the enzyme that produces S1P in the nucleus,in close proximity to its potential nuclear targets. To determine whether nuclear S1P levels areregulated in response to external signals and whether HDACs sense these changes, we treatedcells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, whichenhances phosphorylation and catalytic activity of SphK2 (15). Indeed, PMA increasedamounts of S1P in the nucleus by more than twofold within 5 min (fig. S8C) and also rapidlyHait et al. Page 3Science. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 April 7.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptenhanced colocalization of SphK2 with HDAC1 (fig. S9). Prolonged treatment with PMAinduced nuclear export of SphK2 (8) (fig. S9), which ensured transient inhibition of HDACs.A common response to inhibition or depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 is the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 independently of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (16\u201319). Inagreement with possible involvement of SphK2 in p53-independent expression of p21 (10),silencing SphK2 in MCF-7 cells reduced basal and PMA-induced accumulation of p21 protein(fig. S10A) and mRNA (fig. S10B). Overexpression of SphK2, but not catalytically inactiveSphK2, enhanced PMA-stimulated transcription of a reporter construct containing the p21promoter (fig. S10C), and its depletion reduced it (fig. S10D). Overexpression of SphK2increased acetylation of histone H3-K9 associated with the proximal p21 promoter and furtherenhanced the response to PMA (Fig. 4A), in accordance with the participation of SphK2 inPMA-induced expression of p21 (fig. S10, A to D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)analysis also revealed that, like HDAC1, SphK2 is also associated with the proximal p21promoter (Fig. 4A). Depletion of SphK2 suppressed PMA-induced acetylation of histone H3at the p21 promoter (Fig. 4C), which further supported the notion that SphK2 regulatesHDAC1-dependent deacetylation of histone H3 and repression of p21 gene transcription.We also examined another target gene that shows increased transcription in cells treated withPMA, c-fos (12,20). SphK2 depletion compromised the induction of endogenous c-fosexpression by PMA (fig. S11A) and blocked enhanced c-fos promoter activity (fig. S11B).Overexpression of SphK2, but not that of catalytically inactive SphK2, increased PMA-inducedexpression of c-fos mRNA (fig. S11C) and enhanced c-fos promoter activity (fig. S11D).Finally, ChIP analysis confirmed the presence of SphK2 on the c-fos promoter anddemonstrated that overexpression of SphK2 (but not that of the mutant SphK2 that cannotproduce S1P) enhanced H3 acetylation at the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4B). Conversely, down-regulation of SphK2 decreased acetylation of histone H3 at the c-fos promoter in response toPMA (Fig. 4D).We conclude that HDACs appear to be intra-cellular targets of S1P. Our data reveal a newparadigm of S1P signaling produced by nuclear sphingolipid metabolism, suggesting animportant function for SphK2 in the nucleus. Abundance of nuclear S1P may influence specificand contextual chromatin states that impact gene transcription (Fig. 4E). HDACs have emergedas key targets to reverse aberrant epigenetic changes associated with human diseases (18,21),such as cancer. S1P may therefore influence the delicate balance and dynamic turnover ofhistone acetylation and the transcription of target genes, linking them to epigenetic regulationin response to environmental signals.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grants from the NIH R37GM043880 and R01CA61774 (S.S.).
