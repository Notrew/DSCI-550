Based on phenotypic results, PCR sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting,the isolate was assigned to E. faecium with a chromosomally located VanD allele most closely related to theVanD1 allele.Glycopeptides inhibit cell wall synthesis through the inter-action of their N termini with the D-alanyl-D-alanine termini ofpeptidoglycan precursors. The resulting complexes prevent thetransglycosylases from incorporating disaccharide pentapep-tide subunits into the growing peptidoglycan chain, therebyinhibiting cell wall synthesis (15). Since 1988, many reportsdescribed the increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcifrom Europe and the United States (6, 13). This resistance toglycopeptides occurs via a common mechanism involving mod-ification of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway (8). Fivephenotypes of acquired glycopeptide resistance have beenidentified in enterococci. VanA and VanB are the most com-mon types. They are caused by complex gene clusters that maybe plasmid and/or transposon carried (8). VanE and VanGtypes have each been identified in single strains of Enterococ-cus faecalis (11, 15). Finally, to date, five Enterococcus faeciumstrains with VanD resistance have been reported in the UnitedStates, in Canada, and in Brazil (4, 7, 16, 18, 19). These isolateswere recovered from stool cultures, urine, and blood culturesfrom immunocompromised patients. Each contained a distinctvanD allele, vanD1 to vanD5 (4, 7, 16, 18, 19).Since November 2003, a 56-year-old man had been regularlyadmitted to the hematology and oncology unit of N\u0131\u0302mes Uni-versity Hospital for the treatment of an acute myeloid leuke-mia. He was hospitalized on February 2004 for febrile neutro-penia. Physical examination did not reveal a focal site ofinfection. E. faecium was isolated from three blood cultures.Despite an intravenous antibiotic therapy using levofloxacinand quinupristin/dalfopristin, the patient died 5 days after hisadmission.E. faecium was determined biochemically using the Vitek2-AST N017 identification card (Biomerieux, Marcy-l\u2019Etoile,France). Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined with theE-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on blood agarplates, and antibiotic MICs were interpreted according to therecommendations of the Antibiotic Susceptibility TestingCommittee of the French Society for Microbiology with En-terococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium B91 (VanA\ufffd), andE. faecium B132 (VanB\ufffd) as reference strains (20). The threeisolates from the blood cultures showed the same resistantpattern. They were resistant to penicillin G (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml),gentamicin (MIC, \ufffd2,000 \ufffdg/ml), streptomycin (MIC, \ufffd2,000\ufffdg/ml), tetracycline (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml), linezolid (MIC, \ufffd4 \ufffdg/ml), daptomycin (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml), and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-type antibiotics (MIC, \ufffd8 \ufffdg/ml). They werealso resistant to vancomycin (MIC, \ufffd256 \ufffdg/ml) and teicopla-nin (MIC, \ufffd256 \ufffdg/ml). They were susceptible only to quinu-pristin/dalfopristin (MIC, 0.5 \ufffdg/ml) and intermediate to levo-floxacin (MIC, 2 \ufffdg/ml). Levels of growth of these strains inthe absence of and following the addition of vancomycin (8\ufffdg/ml) were identical (data not shown), indicating that resis-tance was expressed constitutively. One of the three isolateswas genotypically studied and named E. faecium NEF1.To determine the genotype responsible for the unusual re-sistance of this strain, we used a multiplex PCR assay previ-ously described by Dutka-Malen et al., which allows simulta-neous detection of the glycopeptide resistance genotypes vanAand vanB, which encode D-alanine-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac) li-gases, and vanC-1 and vanC-2/3, which encode D-Ala-D-Serligases (9). At the same time, multiplex PCR allows the iden-tification to the species level of the following clinically relevantenterococci: E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. cas-seliflavus/E. flavescens. In this assay, PCR amplicons are dis-criminated from each other based on their molecular sizes.This protocol was modified according to Patel et al. in order tobypass the DNA extraction procedure and to process the PCRassay directly on an isolated colony from blood agar or Muel-ler-Hinton plates (17).

Mul-tiplex PCR performed on the enterococcal isolate resistant tovancomycin and teicoplanin yielded a 550-bp amplified frag-ment specific for an internal fragment of the gene encodingD-Ala-D-Ala ligase of E. faecium. However, despite the highlevel of resistance to glycopeptides of this E. faecium isolate,none of the vanA, vanB, vanC1, or vanC2/3 resistance deter-minants could be amplified. Using degenerate V3 (5\ufffd-GARGAT GGI TSC ATM CAR GGW-3\ufffd) and V4 (5\ufffd-MGT RAAICC IGG CAK RGT RTT-3\ufffd) primers, which allow amplifica-tion of fragments internal to genes encoding related ligases(12), we obtained a 630-bp fragment. This fragment was clonedinto pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield the pGEMT-Van plasmid and introduced into Escherichia coli via transfor-mation. The insert was sequenced. The deduced 223-amino-acid partial peptide showed approximately 90% identity withfive VanD ligases listed in the GenBank database. Primer walksequencing was carried out to amplify the entire D-Ala-D-Lacligase (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Deduced aminoacid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The complete region detected was predictedto encode a ligase of 343 amino acids (Fig. 1). This VanDpeptide showed 85 to 95% amino acid identity to the VanD2(AF153050 [16]), VanD3 (AF175293 [3]), VanD4 (AF277571[7]), and VanD5 (AAR37060 [2]) ligases and 68% and 67%identity with, respectively, the VanA and VanB (B1 and B2)ligases (M97297 [1], U35369 [10], and AY145441 [14]) (Table1). It shared a maximum of 98% amino acid identity with theVanD1 ligase (AF130997 [5]).To search for a possible chromosomal location of the vanDallele, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of I-CeuI-re-stricted DNA as previously described (2). A transfer of DNAfrom electrophoresis gel to a nylon membrane was accom-plished by capillary transfer. For DNA probing of the Southernblot, we used an amplification product obtained by PCR of E.faecium NEF1 using the vanD1 primers previously described(18). This product was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP follow-ing the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Boehringer Mannheim,Indianapolis, Ind.) and hybridized on I-CeuI-restricted pat-terns (Fig. 2). The vanD1 probe hybridized with E. faeciumNEF1 DNA, confirming the chromosomal localization of thisresistance gene as previously described for the vanD1 gene(18). All these results point to the fact that the resistance genein E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the vanD1 allele.In this study, we reported to the best of our knowledge thefirst strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium from Europethat contains a vanD allele. Since this episode of bacteremia,no further strains belonging to this genotype have been iso-lated in our hospital. Similar to previous patients reported withVanD-type glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus, this patientFIG. 1.

For a few months, our patient had been treated severaltimes with vancomycin, but, during this period, the patient hadno enterococcal infections. He received also \ufffd-lactams (amoxi-cillin plus clavulanic acid, imipenem, and cephalosporins),fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and pristinamycin. How-ever, he did not have any links with the United States, Canada,or Brazil, the countries where the five VanD-type glycopep-tide-resistant E. faecium strains have been previously de-scribed. Interestingly, the five E. faecium strains with VanD-type resistance reported before were isolated in patients withmultiple medical problems: diabetes mellitus, aplastic anemia,and, above all, three cases of orthoptic liver transplantation.Phenotypically, this E. faecium presents a very high level ofresistance against teicoplanin compared with the other de-scribed vanD phenotypes. It may represent constitutive high-level expression of the vanD gene cluster. The resistance genein E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the VanD1 allele.The E. faecium NEF1 peptide showed 98% amino acid identityto the VanD1 ligases and a vanD1 probe hybridized with the E.faecium NEF1 DNA. The residues believed to comprise theactive site of VanA are conserved in all enterococcal D-Ala-D-Ala ligases, including our isolate (7) (Fig. 1). It will be inter-esting to characterize the entire vanD operon in E. faeciumNEF1 to detect potential variations in its organization com-pared to vanD1 to vanD5 operons.We showed that the vanD gene of our isolate was chromo-somally located as previously described for the other VanDisolates (8). This distribution may contribute to the paucity ofVanD-type resistant strains in contrast to the widespread andincreasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci car-rying vanA or vanB genes in France.(This work was presented in part in 6th European Congressof Chemotherapy and Infections, Paris, France, December2004, abstr. 348/78P.)We are very grateful to Josiane Campos for performing the entero-coccal multiplex PCR assay.This work was supported by Universite\u0301 de Montpellier 1 (BQR, BQ68).REFERENCES1.
