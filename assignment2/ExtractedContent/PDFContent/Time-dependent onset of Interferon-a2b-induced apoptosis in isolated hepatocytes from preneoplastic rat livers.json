The aimof this study was to further investigate the mechanism of this activation. Isolated hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers induced DNAfragmentation in response to IFN-a2b, which was completely blocked when anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media. IFN-a2b med-iated radical oxygen species (ROS) production that preceded the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW), release of cyto-chrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Bax levels increased in a time-dependent fashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the earlyhours of IFN-a2b treatment. The delayed translocation of Bid into the mitochondria was in concordance with late caspase-8 activation.In conclusion, endogenous TGF-b1 secreted under IFN-a2b stimulus seems to induce cytochrome c release through a mechanism relatedto Bcl-2 family members and loss of mitochondrial DW. Bax protein could be responsible of the release of cytochrome c during the initialhours of IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1. Activated Bid by caspases could amplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing therelease of cytochrome c.\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, it hasbeen stated that IFN-a applied in the early stages of tumorevolution could have a very important clinical effect, whereasits activity in advanced stages would be minimal [3]. We havepreviously shown that IFN-a2b induces apoptosis in isolatedhepatocytes from preneoplastic rat livers [4]. The apoptoticeffect of IFN-a2b was mediated by the production ofTGF-b1 from hepatocytes, due to the fact that when anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media, IFN-a2b-inducedapoptosis was completely blocked.Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essentialphysiologic process required for normal development andmaintenance of liver homeostasis. However, apoptosis ismailto:mcarrill@fbioyf.unr.edu.armailto:carrillo@ifise.gov.ar246 M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253also involved in pathologic conditions, including liverregression, physical and chemical liver injury, viral hepa-titis, and liver carcinogenesis [5]. The aspartate-specific-cysteine-protease (caspase) cascade is now believed to bethe main pathway by which cellular death is orchestrated[6]. There are two pathways by which caspase activation istriggered: the extrinsic and the intrinsic. Both pathwaysconverge on the activation of caspase-3. This caspase isultimately responsible for the majority of the effects [7].The extrinsic pathway is activated by the engagement ofdeath receptors on the cell surface. Caspase-8 is the keyinitiator caspase in the death-receptor pathway [8]. Theintrinsic pathway or non-receptor-mediated apoptosis istriggered by various extracellular and intracellular stress-es, such as growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, DNAdamage, and oncogene induction. Signals that are trans-duced in response to these stresses result in the permeabi-lization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, release ofcytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic molecules, forma-tion of the apoptosome, and caspase activation [9].Among these processes, only the permeabilization step isregulated, and several members of the Bcl-2 family areinvolved in this regulation. The anti-apoptotic proteinsBcl-2 and Bcl-xL can stop the march towards apoptoticdeath by preventing cytochrome c release [10], whereastranslocation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid) tothe mitochondria can induce the release of cytochrome ccontained in the intermembrane space. Once cytochromec is released, the downstream cascade of caspase activa-tion is irreversible [11].The endogenous transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) is an important physiological mediator for apoptosisin both normal and neoplastic liver [12]. It has beenreported that TGF-b1 plays an important role as aninducer of apoptosis in a variety of cells, including pri-mary hepatocytes [13], fetal rat hepatocytes [14], andhepatoma cell lines [15\u201317]. Although the mechanismsby which TGF-b1 induces apoptosis in hepatocytes havenot been fully elucidated, it is well established that TGF-b1 mediates radical oxygen species (ROS) productionthat contributes to the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, therelease of cytochrome c, and the activation of at leastcaspases-2, -3, -8, and -9 [14\u201319]. However, the involve-ment of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-xL proteins in TGF-b1-in-duced apoptosis has not been completely established.TGF-b1 decreased the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL indiverse hepatoma cell lines [16,20] whereas in other hep-atoma cells no changes in Bax or Bcl-xL were observed[17]. On the other hand, overexpression of Bcl-2 blockedinduction of apoptosis by TGF-b1 in human hepatomacells [21].In the current study, we wished to further investigate themechanism of caspase activation during IFN-a2b-inducedapoptosis via TGF-b1. For this purpose, experiments wereperformed to characterize the time-dependent effects ofIFN-a2b via TGF-b1 on hepatocytes from preneoplasticlivers.2. Materials and methods2.1. ChemicalsDiethylnitrosamine (DEN), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), 2 0,7 0-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA),and collagenase were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.IFN-a2b was kindly provided by BioSidus Laboratory(Buenos Aires, Argentina). Anti-caspase-3 (L-18), anti-cas-pase-8 (H-134), anti-cytochrome c, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-xL,anti-Bid, and secondary antibodies were obtained fromSanta Cruz Biotechnology. The fluorogenic substrates forcaspase-3 N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Ac-DEVD-AMC) and for caspase-8 N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AMC(Ac-IETD-AMC) were purchased from Alexis Co. Fluores-cent probe tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM)was from Fluka. All other chemicals were of the highestgrade commercially available.2.2. Animals and treatmentAdult male Wistar rats (330\u2013380 g) were maintained in aroom at constant temperature with a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle,with free access to food and water. The experimental pro-tocol was performed according to the \u2018\u2018Guide for the Careand Use of Laboratory Animals\u2019\u2019 (National Institutes ofHealth, publication no. 25\u201328, revised 1996). The animalswere subjected to a two-phase model of rat hepatocarcino-genesis, for details see Ref. [22]. The initiation stage wasperformed by the administration of two i.p. necrogenicdoses of DEN (150 mg/kg body weight) 2 weeks apart.One week after the last injection of DEN, the rats received20 mg/kg body weight of 2-AAF by gavage for fourconsecutive days per week during 3 weeks.2.3. Cell isolation and cultureHepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion andmechanical disruption as described previously [23]. A hepa-tocyte-enriched population from the entire liver containingboth preneoplastic hepatocytes plus hepatocytes from thesurrounding non-preneoplastic liver tissue was obtainedby centrifugation twice at 40 g [24]. To remove residualadherent cells from the hepatocytes, the suspension wasincubated twice for 20 min in plastic dishes and the hepato-cytes were transferred on culture plates.Cells were cultured at 37 \ufffdC in a humidified atmosphereof 5% CO2 in RPMI medium with L-glutamine supple-mented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and strepto-mycin (100 lg/mL). Two hours later, the medium waschanged to fresh medium supplemented with 0.2% FCS,and cells were treated with 105 U/mL IFN-a2b or leftuntreated. This dose of IFN-a2b induced in vitro a similarincrement of hepatocytes apoptosis than the one observedin vivo, when rats with preneoplasia received IFN-a2b attherapeutic doses [22]. Cells were cultured at differenttimes: 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h.M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 247The viability of all cell suspensions used, checked byTrypan blue exclusion, was between 85% and 95%.2.4. TGF-b1 assayHepatocyte-conditioned media were collected at the dif-ferent times and TGF-b1 was quantitated using an ELISAtest (R&D Systems).2.5. Analysis of apoptosis by DNA fragmentationHepatocytes cultured at different times were scrapped offand centrifuged, lysed with 5 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),20 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and stored at4 \ufffdC for 15 min. Intact nuclei were eliminated by centrifu-gation and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000g for30 min at 4 \ufffdC. DNA in the supernatant was purified asdescribed previously [25]. Cytosolic DNA was subjectedto 10% PAGE. The gel was incubated for 30 min with0.5 lg/mL ethidium bromide and visualized under trans-mitted ultraviolet light by using the BioChemi System.2.6. Analysis of apoptosis by annexin V stainingApoptosis was investigated using the FITC-Annexin VApoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences). Cultured hepatocyteswere stained according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions.Then cells were washed, fixed, and viewed under fluores-cence microscope. Apoptotic cells were counted by examin-ing >1000 cells/dish and expressed per 100 hepatocytes.2.7. Measurement of intracellular ROSFormation of ROS was determined as previouslydescribed [26,27], with slight modifications. Cells culturedat different times were loaded with 5 lM DCFH-DA for20 min at 37 \ufffdC with 5% CO2. Fluorescence was measuredon a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-5301 PC(excitation wavelength 488 nm, emission wavelength525 nm).2.8. Preparation of mitochondria-enriched fractions andcytosolic extractsHepatocytes were scrapped off the plates, and centri-fuged, washed, and resuspended in 300 mmol/L sucrosewith protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by sonicationand incubated at 4 \ufffdC for 15 min and lysates were centri-fuged at 1000g. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions werethen produced as described by de Duve et al. [28]. Proteinswere quantified according to Lowry et al. [29]. Enrichmentof each cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was deter-mined by the measurement of specific activities of succinatecytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial marker) and lactatedehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) [30]. The specific activityof lactate dehydrogenase in cytosol was 9 \u00b1 2-fold higherthan in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the specificactivity of succinate cytochrome c reductase in mitochon-dria was 17 \u00b1 2-fold higher than in cytosol.2.9. Analysis of caspases-3 and -8 activitiesCaspases-3 and -8 activities were evaluated by measur-ing the proteolytic cleavage of their fluorogenic substratesAc-DEVD-AMC and Ac-IETD-AMC, respectively,according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. Briefly, cyto-solic extract (50 lg of protein) was added into reactionbuffer containing 20 mmol/L Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol,2 mmol/L DTT, and 200 lmol/L caspase substrate. Thereaction mixture was incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h. After thattime, enzymatic activity was measured in a luminescencespectrometer (Aminco-Bowman Series 2) (excitationwavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm).2.10. Western blot analysisProcaspases-3 and -8 were detected in cytosolic extracts(20 lg per lane), cytochrome c was analyzed in mitochon-drial and cytosolic fractions (5 lg protein/condition).Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bid were explored in mitochondria-en-riched fractions (30 lg protein for Bax and Bcl-xL, and15 lg for Bid). Samples were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGEand electroblotted onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes.Immunoblots were blocked and incubated overnight at4 \ufffdC with the primary antibody (1:500). Finally, they wereincubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody(1:5000) and bands were detected by ECL detection system(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoreactivebands were quantified using the Gel-Pro Analyzer (MediaCybernetics) software. In all Western blotting analysis,the uniformity of protein loading was checked usingPonceau S.2.11. Analysis of mitochondrial transmembrane potentialTo examine mitochondrial DW, cultured hepatocyteswere loaded with TMRM, a membrane-permeable cationicfluorophore that accumulates in mitochondria in propor-tion to their DW [31]. DW was determined by using a ratiofluorescence approach [32].2.12. Statistical analysisThe results were expressed as means \u00b1 SE.

Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253were stimulated with IFN-a2b at 1 and 4 h of culture.However, IFN-a2b presence in the culture media induceda twofold increase of TGF-b1 secretion at 7 h of culture.TGF-b1 levels continued significantly increased at 20 and24 h of culture (Fig. 1).3.2. DNA fragmentation analysisAccording to other authors [25], only cytosolic, frag-mented DNA was isolated, due to the fact that in totalDNA isolation experiments it was difficult to observe thetypical oligosomal ladder.A representative time dependence study of the cell deathprocess is shown in Fig. 2a. Cultured hepatocytes did notshow DNA ladder after 1 and 4 h of IFN-a2b stimulus.A very small amount of low molecular weight DNA frag-mentation was first observed at 7 h of incubation withIFN-a2b, and continuously increased for the next studiedhours, reaching a maximum at 24 h of culture. In contrast,fragmented DNA was not observed in cultured cells thatwere left untreated at all studied times (data not shown).Fig. 2. Effect of IFN-a2b on DNA fragmentation. Hepatocytes frompreneoplastic livers were incubated for 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h without (notshown) and with IFN-a2b (a), and also with IFN-a2b plus anti-TGF-b1(b). Cells were lysed and subjected to cytoplasmic DNA extraction.Purified low molecular weight DNA was electrophoresed on 10%polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ultraviolet fluorescence by stainingwith ethidium bromide. A representative experiment is shown.In addition, experiments were performed with IFN-a2bplus anti-TGF-b1 to demonstrate whether the DNA frag-mentation observed in IFN-a2b-treated cells is mediatedby the production of TGF-b1 from hepatocytes. Whenanti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media, no DNAcleavage was detected (Fig. 2b).3.3. Annexin V staining analysisTable 1 shows the percentage of apoptotic hepatocytesby annexin V staining at the different hours of culture.The percentage of apoptotic cells in IFN-a2b-treated cul-tures significantly increased over unstimulated cultures at20 and 24 h. When anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culturemedia, no increase in the percentage of apoptotic hepato-cytes could be detected.3.4. ROS production analysisIt has been described that TGF-b1-induced apoptosis inrat fetal hepatocytes is mediated by ROS production [25].In this work, we examined whether the generation ofROS is involved in the IFN-a2b-induced apoptotic celldeath of hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers. For thispurpose, we used DCFH-DA, an oxidation-sensitive fluo-rescent probe [27]. Cells were incubated at different times(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) with or without IFN-a2b. Hepatocytes stimulated with this cytokine showed amaximum increase in ROS production at 1 h of culture(Fig. 3). After this time, ROS decreased, returning to con-trol values. The presence of anti-TGF-b1 did not affect thepeak of ROS observed at 1 h of culture.3.5. Caspases-3 and -8 activation analysisIn this work, time-course experiments to analyse theactivities of caspases-3 and -8, and the expressions ofprocaspases-3 and -8 following IFN-a2b treatment wereperformed. These procaspases are converted into activesubunits during the course of activation [16]. Thus,decreases in densities of procaspase-3 or -8 bands indicateactivation of the respective caspase.Fig. 3. IFN-a2b induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species content.Hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers were cultured for different times(0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) in the absence or presence of IFN-a2b.The production of ROS was analyzed as described in Section 2. Resultsfrom IFN-a2b- (black circles) and IFN-a2b plus anti-TGF-b1- (whitecircles) treated hepatocytes are expressed as percentages of control(untreated) cells and are means \u00b1 SE from at least four independentexperiments. *p < 0.05 vs. untreated cells.M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 249Figs. 4a and b show that caspase-3 like and caspase-8activities significantly increased at 24 h of culture underIFN-a2b stimulus (40% and 85%, respectively, comparedwith untreated cells). Before this time, no increase in casp-ases-3 and -8 activities could be detected. According tothese results, procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 levels signifi-cantly decreased after 24 h of IFN-a2b treatment (Figs.4c and d). Besides, immunoblotting studies showed thatFig. 4. Time course analysis of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation during IFNcourse analysis of (a) caspase-3 and (b) caspase-8 activities. Cells were incubatetime (1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h), and caspases-3 and -8 activities were assayed. Resuexperiments with duplicate dishes for each point. *p < 0.05 vs. unstimulated cellprocaspase-8 levels. Hepatocytes were untreated (\ufffd) or treated (+) with IFN-procaspase-3 levels started to diminish at 20 h of culturein presence of IFN-a2b, whereas procaspase-8 levels start-ed to decrease at 7 h of stimulation with IFN-a2b,although these decreases were not statistically significant.On the other hand, no changes in procaspase-3 orprocaspase-8 protein levels were observed in unstimulatedcultured hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers (Figs. 4cand d).These data showed that caspases-3 and -8 were pro-cessed and activated during IFN-a2b-induced apoptosisvia TGF-b1. However, there was no clear evidence if onecaspase is being activated before the other.3.6. Release of cytochrome c and mitochondrialtransmembrane potential analysisWe studied the intracellular distribution of cytochromec in IFN-a2b-stimulated hepatocytes from preneoplasticlivers. As early as 4 h after treating with IFN-a2b, therewas a significant increase in the cytochrome c content ofthe cytosol and its levels increased over time, reaching amaximum at 20 h. At the same time, cytochrome c contentdecreased in the mitochondria. These results showed thatthe release of the cytochrome c was an early cellularresponse to TGF-b1 (Figs. 5a and b).The disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane poten-tial (DW) has been defined as an early irreversible stage ofapoptosis, preceding caspase-3 activation [10]. In agree-ment with results previously reported for adult and fetalrat hepatocytes [33,34], in this work we presented evidencethat the loss of mitochondrial DW was coincident with the-a2b-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers.

Analysis of the Bcl-2 family proteins expressionThe Bcl-2 family of proteins is related to the mitochon-drial changes during apoptosis. Bax and Bcl-xL involve-ment in TGF-b1-induced programmed cell death iscontroversial [16,17,20]. So, we analyzed Bax and Bcl-xLmitochondrial content in hepatocytes from preneoplasticlivers. Results showed that the levels of Bax increased inmitochondria of hepatocytes after 4 h of IFN-a2b treat-ment (30% compared with untreated cells) and augmentedin a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 20 hof culture (95% of increase with respect to unstimulatedcells) (Fig. 6a). It is well known that IFN-a induces apop-tosis in different tumor cell lines through the activation ofpro-apoptotic Bax [35], so we have included Bax activationstudies in cultured cells treated with IFN-a2b and anti-TGF-b1 in order to discard a possible induction of Baxby IFN-a2b itself. The results indicated that the presenceof anti-TGF-b1 in the culture media of IFN-a2b-stimulatedhepatocytes completely blocked the increase of mitochon-drial Bax protein levels at the studied times (data notFig. 6. Role of Bcl-2 family proteins in IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis ofhepatocytes from preneoplastic livers. (a) Kinetic study of Bax and Bcl-xLmitochondrial levels, analyzed by Western blot. Densitometric analyseswere performed in at least four independent experiments. Data areexpressed as percentages of control (untreated) cells and are means \u00b1 SE.*p < 0.05 vs. control cells. (b) A representative experiment of a Westernblot analysis of Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bid protein levels in mitochondriafractions is shown.M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 251shown). So, Bax up-regulation in IFN-a2b-treated cells ismediated by the TGF-b1 secreted from hepatocytes.On the other hand, Bcl-xL mitochondrial content wasdecreased in IFN-a2b-stimulated cells already at 1 h oftreatment (30% compared with untreated cells), and reacheda diminution of 50% at 7 h (Fig. 6a). This down-regulation ofBcl-xL in the early hours of apoptosis, although no signifi-cant during the time-course study, is in agreement with pre-vious reports [14,16]. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-xL expression ratiowas calculated from the densitometric analysis of Westernblots; the ratio clearly increased during the studied times:1.5 \u00b1 0.1, 1.6 \u00b1 0.2, 2.7 \u00b1 0.3, 3.5 \u00b1 0.4, and 3.3 \u00b1 0.3, at1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h, respectively.We also examined the mitochondrial levels of pro-apop-totic protein Bid. Caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bidgreatly increases its pro-death activity and results in trans-location to mitochondria, where promotes cytochrome crelease [35]. Fig. 6b shows that truncated Bid increased inmitochondria after 20 h of culture. As expected, thisdelayed translocation of Bid protein was in concordancewith a late caspase-8 activation.4. DiscussionDysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated innumerous pathological conditions, including cancer, auto-immune disorders, viral infections, and others [5,7]. Effortsaimed at treating these diseases by manipulating cell suicidewould seem to have great potential, although they are at arelatively early stage.In a previous work [4], we showed that IFN-a2b-in-duced production of TGF-b1 by hepatocytes from preneo-plastic livers is involved in the apoptotic elimination ofpreneoplastic foci. In vitro studies revealed enhanced apop-tosis of IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes at 24 h of culture,and this effect was mediated by hepatocytic TGF-b1.Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of IFN-a2b-in-duced apoptosis via TGF-b1 in isolated hepatocytes frompreneoplastic rat livers by exploring some critical factorsinvolved in the apoptotic pathway.The present work was made on a mixed population ofhepatocytes (preneoplastic plus surrounding cells).Although we were unable to separate both populations,the study of the apoptotic phenomenon induced by IFN-a2b in the whole preneoplastic liver is of great interest, dueto the fact that patients with liver diseases treated with thiscytokine, such as chronic hepatitis B or C, may already havesmall, clinically undetectable preneoplastic foci duringtherapy.The induction of apoptosis by IFN-a2b was determinedby annexin V staining. As previously reported [4], the per-centage of apoptotic hepatocytes in IFN-a2b-treated cul-tures increased twofold over unstimulated cultures at24 h. The same increase was also observed at 20 h ofIFN-a2b stimulus. In accordance, the analysis of DNAfragmentation showed a maximal increase of cytosolicDNA at 24 h of culture. The addition of anti-TGF-b1blocked hepatocytes apoptosis, with no increase in DNAfragmentation and percentages of apoptotic hepatocytes,similar to those in unstimulated cultures.Reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen perox-ides or oxygen radicals, are integral control elements in thecell\u2019s decision to enter apoptosis. IFN-a2b-mediated apop-tosis via TGF-b1 in hepatocytes from preneoplastic liverswas preceded by an enhancement of ROS production. Anearly ROS production induced by TGF-b1 has been previ-ously described in fetal rat hepatocytes [14,34]. However, inthe present study the maximum increase in ROS at 1 h afterIFN-a2b treatment was not coincident with the highestconcentration of TGF-b1 in conditioned media detectedafter 7 h of treatment. Moreover, the peak of ROS at 1 hwas not affected by the presence of anti-TGF-b1 in the cul-ture media. In consequence, the increase of ROS might bemediated by IFN-a2b but not by TGF-b1. It has beenshown that IFN-c induces ROS generation via upregula-tion of NADPH oxidase, a ROS-producing system [37].The same mechanism has been described to be activatedby IFN-a in human neutrophils [38]. So, it is possible thatin our model IFN-a2b could be raising ROS levels byNADPH oxidase induction. Moreover, further work withscavengers of reactive species is in process to providedirect evidence that the generation of ROS is involved inthe IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis.In the current study, we observed that caspases-3 and -8 were activated in IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes from pre-neoplastic livers. Previous studies have indicated that acti-vation of caspase-8 precedes the activation of caspase-3 inTGF-b1-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells [16]. Howev-er, we were unable to define an ordered and sequentialprocessing of individual caspases. On the other hand,Scaffidi et al. [39] previously reported that in some typesof cells such as liver cells there is a minimal amount ofreceptor-activated caspase-8 and probably insufficient toinduce downstream effector caspase cleavage. This lowcaspase-8 activity is thought not to be usually detectedbut to be enough to cleave Bid. Truncated Bid then trans-locates to the mitochondria where initiates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signals including cytochrome crelease and efficient activation of both caspases-8 and -3.In view of the fact that procaspase-8 levels started todecrease at 7 h of IFN-a2b treatment, we studied Bid pro-tein mitochondrial levels. The delayed translocation of Bidto the mitochondria (after 20 h of culture, see Fig. 6b)allowed us to ascertain that the mechanism postulatedby Scaffidi et al. [39] is unlikely to contribute significantlyto the apoptotic effect of IFN-a2b on hepatocytes frompreneoplastic livers.In the present study, Bax increased in a time-dependentfashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the early hoursof IFN-a2b treatment. Therefore, the relative ratioincreased during the studied times, clearly favoring theapoptotic process. It has been reported that TGF-b1 candown-regulate Bcl-xL protein levels in some hepatoma cells[16,20] and fetal rat hepatocytes [18] without affecting Bax252 M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253expression. Therefore, to our knowledge, this is the firststudy where TGF-b1 induced mitochondrial Bax overex-pression in hepatic cells.We have also shown that cytochrome c is early releasedinto the cytoplasm in the time course of TGF-b1-inducedapoptosis (Fig. 5). This suggested that an apoptosome-like-caspase-activation mechanism could be involved. Theexact mechanism by which cytochrome c is released fromthe mitochondria during the apoptosis has not been eluci-dated. Current ideas suggest that Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL preventthe release of cytochrome c and, therefore, suppress apop-tosis, whereas Bax and cleaved Bid promotes cytochrome crelease and apoptotic cell death [9,40]. In our study, therelease of cytochrome c into the cytosol was coincidentwith the increase of Bax protein levels in mitochondria.These data are in good agreement with previous observa-tions that Bax protein can directly induce the release ofcytochrome c, without apparent requirement for caspases[41]. On the other hand, it has been reported that Bid isa much more potent cytochrome c-releasing factor thanBax [36]. In accordance with this, the maximal levels ofcytochrome c found in cytosol at 20 h were correspondedwith augmented levels of Bid protein in mitochondria.In conclusion, IFN-a2b treatment of hepatocytes frompreneoplastic rat livers produced an increase in ROS andTGF-b1 secretion. This growth factor seems to induce cyto-chrome c release through a mechanism related to Bcl-2family members. Bax protein could be responsible of therelease of cytochrome c during the initial hours of IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1, whereas at later times(after 20 h of culture) activation of Bid by caspases couldamplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing the releaseof cytochrome c.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Research Grant PICT 05-11107 (M.C.
