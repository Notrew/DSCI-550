"Two Functional Type VI Secretion Systems in Avian PathogenicEscherichia coli Are Involved in Different Pathogenic PathwaysJiale Ma,a,b Yinli Bao,a,b Min Sun,a,b Wenyang Dong,a,b Zihao Pan,a,b Wei Zhang,a,b Chengping Lu,a,b Huochun Yaoa,bCollege of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Chinaa; Key Lab of Animal Bacteriology, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing, ChinabType VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are involved in the pathogenicity of several Gram-negative bacteria. The VgrG protein, acore component and effector of T6SS, has been demonstrated to perform diverse functions. The N-terminal domain ofVgrG protein is a homologue of tail fiber protein gp27 of phage T4, which performs a receptor binding function and deter-mines the host specificity. Based on sequence analysis, we found that two putative T6SS loci exist in the genome of theavian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strain TW-XM. To assess the contribution of these two T6SSs to TW-XM pathogene-sis, the crucial clpV clusters of these two T6SS loci and their vgrG genes were deleted to generate a series of mutants. Conse-quently, T6SS1-associated mutants presented diminished adherence to and invasion of several host cell lines cultured in vitro,decreased pathogenicity in duck and mouse infection models in vivo, and decreased biofilm formation and bacterial competitiveadvantage. In contrast, T6SS2-associated mutants presented a significant decrease only in the adherence to and invasion ofmouse brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) line bEnd.3 and brain tissue of the duck infection model. These results sug-gested that T6SS1 was involved in the proliferation of APEC in systemic infection, whereas VgrG-T6SS2 was responsible only forcerebral infection. Further study demonstrated that VgrG-T6SS2 was able to bind to the surface of bEnd.3 cells, whereas it didnot bind to DF-1 (chicken embryo fibroblast) cells, which further proved the interaction of VgrG-T6SS2 with the surface ofBMECs.Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is a groupof strains that have been implicated in manifold infections inhumans and animals, including urinary tract infections, newbornmeningitis, abdominal sepsis, and septicemia (1). Avian patho-genic Escherichia coli (APEC), an important ExPEC subgroup,causes respiratory or systemic infections and large financial lossesin the poultry industry worldwide (2). APEC shares importantvirulence traits with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), neonatal men-ingitis Escherichia coli (NMEC), and septicemia-associated E. coli(SEPEC), representing a potential zoonotic risk (3\u20135). Recently, ithas been confirmed that some closely related clones of APEC andNMEC were able to cause extraintestinal infections in bothchicken and rat models of human neonatal meningitis, suggestingthat there is no host specificity for these clonal types of isolates(6, 7).Today, one important but overlooked bacterial virulence traitis the delivery of proteins and toxins to host cells through special-ized secretion systems (8\u201310). The type VI secretion system(T6SS) has been described for several bacterial species (8, 11, 12),including APEC (13, 14), and represents a new paradigm of pro-tein secretion (11). de Pace et al. (14) found that the mutants ofT6SS core genes (clpV and hcp) of APEC strain SEPT362 displayeddecreased adherence and actin rearrangement on epithelial cells.A similar result was revealed by research on the Hcp mutant of theneonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) strain RS218 (15). However,the means by which T6SSs contribute to virulence remain un-known, and the mechanisms warrant further investigation.The minimal machinery necessary for the functionality ofT6SSs has been revealed, and it is assembled by at least 13 coreproteins called \u201ccore components\u201d (10, 16). Two T6SS-associatedeffectors, hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and valine-gly-cine repeat G (VgrG), function as exported chaperones of effectors(12, 17) and have similar structures of the (gp27)3-(gp5)3 spikecomplex (18, 19). The tail fiber protein can bind to the receptor ofsensitive bacteria specifically, which confers on bacteriophage ahigh degree of host specificity, and this mechanism may also beapplied to the host cell recognition of the gp27 domain of VgrG(20, 21). Some VgrG proteins have different C-terminal exten-sions, including certain domains with different activities. For ex-ample, VgrG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa carries a zinc-metal-loprotease domain, while VgrG1 from Vibrio cholerae containsrepeats in structural toxin A (RtxA) (22).In this study, the results indicated that the two functionalT6SSs are encoded in the genome of meningitis-causing APEC K1strain TW-XM. T6SS1 is required for interaction with eukaryoticas well as prokaryotic host cells and not only is involved in thepathogenesis of APEC systemic infection but also contributes tobiofilm formation and bacterial competition. However, T6SS2 isresponsible only for cerebral infection. The comprehensive anal-ysis revealed that T6SS1 and T6SS2 of APEC may function indifferent pathogenic pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and growth conditions.

All strains (Table 1) were grownaerobically in LB medium or Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium(DMEM) (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C. When necessary, antibiotics were added atthe following concentrations: 100 \ufffdg/ml ampicillin, 30 \ufffdg/ml chloram-phenicol, and 50 \ufffdg/ml kanamycin (Km).Animals. Seven-day-old ducks, 5-week-old male ICR mice, and NewZealand White rabbits were purchased from the Comparative MedicineCenter of Yangzhou University and housed in filter-top cages with freeaccess to food and water under a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle inaccordance with the guidelines of Beijing Laboratory Animal Welfare andEthics. All animal experiments were approved by the Department of Sci-ence and Technology of Jiangsu Province. The license number was SYXK(SU) 2010-0005.Purification of recombinant protein and preparation of polyclonalantibody. A total of four genes were cloned in frame into the pET28avector; the protein expression and purification were carried out as de-scribed previously (23). The supernatant of lysate was purified by a His-Trap FF column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) ac-cording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The New Zealand Whiterabbits were used for producing polyclonal antibody (anti-Hcp-T6SS1,anti-Hcp [XmtA]-T6SS2, anti-VgrG-T6SS1, and anti-VgrG-T6SS2). Thepurified fusion proteins emulsified with adjuvant ISA 206 (Seppic,France) were injected into the back of the rabbits once every 2 weeks.Construction of isogenic mutants and complementation of mu-tants. Disruptions of the vgrG genes, clpV genes, tle4 gene, and tli4 gene inthe chromosome of strain TW-XM were achieved by using \ufffd red mu-tagenesis (24). For complementation of \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1, \ufffdVgrG-T6SS2,and \ufffdTle4, the coding sequences of genes plus their putative promoterregions were amplified from the TW-XM genome and independentlycloned into pUC19 (25) using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Allprimers used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental ma-terial.Isolation of bacterial secretory proteins and eukaryotic cytoplasmicproteins of host cells. Bacteria (106 CFU) were added to wells of a24-well tissue culture plate containing a monolayer (105 cells) ofbEnd.3 or DF-1 cells (from Shanghai Fuxiang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.)in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. Plates were incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0Cin a 5% CO2 atmosphere to allow full interaction between bacteria andcells. The monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered sa-line (PBS), and the culture medium and washing PBS collected by theabove steps were passed through 0.22-\ufffdm filters to remove bacterialcell contamination. Then, the secretory proteins were concentrated byTABLE 1 Summary of bacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmid Characteristic or functionaSource orreferenceE. coli strainsTW-XM Virulent strain of APEC isolated from brain of a duck that died from septicemia; Strr Collected inour lab\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS1 with TW-XM background This studyK\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 containing kanamycin resistance This study\ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This study\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1\u20132 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS1 and vgrG-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This studyC\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 APEC_XM \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 with the vector pUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C, Ampr This studyC\ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 APEC_XM \ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 with the vector pUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C, Ampr This studyP\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 APEC_XM \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This studyP\ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 APEC_XM \ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This study\ufffdT6SS1 Deletion mutant of clpV-T6SS1 with TW-XM background This studyK\ufffdT6SS1 \ufffdT6SS1 containing kanamycin resistance This study\ufffdT6SS2 Deletion mutant of clpV-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This study\ufffdTle4 Deletion mutant of tle4 with TW-XM background This study\ufffdTle4Tli4 Deletion mutant of tle4 tli4 with TW-XM background This studyK\ufffdTle4 \ufffdTle4 containing kanamycin resistance This studyP\ufffdTle4 APEC_XM \ufffdTle4 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This studyC\ufffdTle4 APEC_XM \ufffdTle4 with the vector pUC19-tle4\u2013T6SS1C, Ampr This studyMG1655 Strain induced by nalidixic acid resistance This studyDH5\ufffd Cloning host for maintaining the recombinant plasmids InvitrogenBL21 Host for expressing the recombinant proteins InvitrogenPlasmidspET28a(\ufffd) Expression vector, Kanr InvitrogenpET28a-hcp-T6SS1 pET28a inserted in frame with the hcp-T6SS1 gene for expressing Hcp-T6SS1 This studypET28a-hcp-T6SS2 pET28a inserted in frame with the hcp-T6SS2 gene for expressing Hcp-T6SS2 This studypET28a-vgrG-T6SS1 pET28a inserted in frame with the vgrG-T6SS1 gene for expressing VgrG-T6SS1 This studypET28a-vgrG-T6SS2 pET28a inserted in frame with the vgrG-T6SS2 gene for expressing VgrG-T6SS2 This studypMD 19-T vector TA cloning vector TaKaRapUC19 E. coli shuttle vector; Ampr TaKaRapUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length vgrG-T6SS1 ORF This studypUC19-vgrG-T6SS2C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length vgrG-T6SS2 ORF This studypUC19-tle4-T6SS1C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length tle4 ORF This studypKD46 \ufffd red recombinase expression plasmid 24pKD4 pANTS\ufffd derivative containing FRT-flanked kanamycin resistance 24pCP20 TS replication and thermal induction of FLP synthesis 24a ORF, open reading frame; FRT, FLP recombination target; TS, temperature sensitive.Ma et al.3868 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgusing 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff spin columns (Millipore). Thequality of secretory proteins was verified by the absence of the cytosolicmarker cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) (15). The mono-layers were washed three times with PBS again, digested with trypsin,and disrupted by sterile deionized water to release cytoplasmic pro-tein. The above fluids were also passed through 0.22-\ufffdm filters toremove the remnant of bacteria and cellular debris, and the resultantconcentration of cytoplasmic proteins was similar to that from theabove extraction. The quality of cytoplasmic proteins was verified bythe presence of the eukaryotic cytosolic marker \ufffd-actin protein (26).The concentrations of the wild-type strain and mutant proteins wereassessed using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit(Pierce Protein Biology of Thermo Scientific). Fifty micrograms ofprotein was loaded into each lane for SDS-PAGE, followed by Westernblot analysis. The Western affinity blotting assay was carried out asdescribed previously (27), and all assays were repeated at least twice.Biofilm formation assay and SEM. The biofilm assay (1% crystal vi-olet method) was performed as previously described (28, 29) in 96-wellplates, and the A595 was recorded. Wells with sterile broth medium servedas controls. All biofilm assays were run in triplicate. Scanning opticalmicroscopy of biofilm stained by crystal violet was performed as previ-ously described (30). The microtiter plate was air dried at 37\u00b0C for 30 min,and the bacterial biofilms were observed under \t40 magnification. Scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed as previously described(29). The biofilms on coverslips were washed three times with PBS andfixed by using 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Observations were performed at 5 kVwith a scanning electron microscope (model S800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Ja-pan).Bacterial competition experiments. For bacterial competition exper-iments, both strains were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (donor to recipient) intriplicate after the cultures were normalized to an optical density at 600nm (OD600) of 0.5 (31). This mixture was then spotted on a nitrocellulosemembrane on a 1.5% (wt/vol) agar LB plate. Competition mixtures wereincubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C. Bacterial spots were harvested, and the CFU permilliliter of the surviving donor and recipient were determined by plating10-fold serial dilutions on selective medium plates. Wild-type TW-XMand \ufffdTle4Tli4 were selected on LB plates with streptomycin (50 \ufffdg/ml);MG1655 was selected by nalidixic acid (100 \ufffdg/ml); \ufffdT6SS1 (Kanr),\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 (Kanr), and \ufffdTle4 (Kanr) were selected on kanamycin (50-\ufffdg/ml) plates; C\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1, C\ufffdTle4, P\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1, and P\ufffdTle4were selected on ampicillin (100-\ufffdg/ml) plates.Assessment of pathogenicity by LD50 and survival curve. The viru-lence of each strain was evaluated in duck and mouse models by 50%lethal dose (LD50) as described previously (25). Eight infection groupswere intramuscularly injected in the pelma with 10-fold serially dilutedsuspensions containing 103 to 107 CFU of bacteria in sterile PBS. Theblank control group was injected with sterile PBS. The ducks were ob-served for 7 days until survival rates were steady. The LD50 of each strainwas also tested with a mouse model. LD50 results were calculated by usingthe Reed-Muench method. Furthermore, 107 CFU/ml of each strain wasinjected into the pelma muscles of ducks (16 ducks per strain) to obtainthe survival curve. The groups were observed throughout a 7-day period,and survival condition was recorded every 12 h.Proliferation capacity of APEC in animal infection model. Eachgroup consisted of 15 ducks, and the dose of intramuscular injection inthe pelma was 5 \t 106 CFU/duck (10\t LD50). At 24 h postinfection, thediseased ducks were selected for euthanization and dissection. Bacteriawere isolated from the blood, spleens, lungs, and brain homogenates byplating 10-fold serial dilutions on MacConkey agar. The number of bac-teria colonizing the organs of the ducks during systemic infection wasobtained.Adherence and invasion assays in bEnd.3 and DF-1 cells. Accordingto the results of analyzing bacterial proliferation capacity in vivo, we usedchicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1) as the model of system infection,while mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) (bEnd.3)were used as the model of meningitis. E. coli invasion assays were per-formed as described previously (32, 33). Bacteria were added to monolay-ers at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 bacteria/cells. The invasionfrequency was calculated by dividing the number of invaded bacteria bythe CFU of the original inoculum. Results were presented as the relativeinvasion frequency compared with the invasion frequency of wild-typeTW-XM, which was arbitrarily set at 100%. The assay was performed insextuplicate. Adherence assays were performed similarly to the invasionassay, except that the gentamicin treatment step was omitted.qRT-PCR. The bacteria were grown to the logarithmic phase, andRNA was isolated by using the E.Z.N.A. bacterial RNA isolation kit(Omega, Beijing, China). Contaminating DNA was removed from thesamples with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and cDNAsynthesis was performed by using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit(TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the transcription levels ofthe virulence factors using SYBR premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)and gene-specific primers (see Table S2 in the supplemental material),and the data were normalized to the housekeeping gene dnaE transcript(25). The relative fold change was calculated by using the threshold cycle(\ufffd\ufffdCT) method (34).Assessment of VgrG protein binding to target cells. To analyze thecell binding competence of VgrG proteins, both indirect enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis were carried outusing antibody against His-VgrG proteins. DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells (4 \t 104cells per well in a 96-well microplate [BD Biosciences]) were incubatedwith 12 \ufffdg/ml endotoxin-free His-VgrG proteins for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. Themonolayers were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with 10%skim milk at 37\u00b0C for 1 h or used to extract protein samples for Westernblot analysis. VgrG-ELISA was performed as reported previously (35),and blots were probed with a mouse anti-His antibody (1:2,000; Beyo-time). A Western affinity blotting assay was carried out as described pre-viously (27). Samples were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvi-nylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and the detection of boundimmunoglobulin was achieved using mouse anti-His antibody and horse-radish peroxidase\u2013 goat anti-mouse serum.Statistical analysis. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The difference between mean values amonggroups was first evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) andthen by pairwise comparison of the mean values between the two groups,followed by Tukey\u2019s Student rank test. The comparisons between twogroups of abnormal distribution were evaluated by the nonparametricMann-Whitney U test, and the duck survival data were analyzed by theKaplan-Meier estimator method. Differences with a P value of \ufffd0.05 wereconsidered significant, and a P value of \ufffd0.01 was considered greatlysignificant.RESULTSTwo T6SS gene clusters exist in the genome of meningitis-caus-ing APEC K1 strain TW-XM. The orthologous T6SS clusterswidely exist in the genomes of various E. coli pathotypes and aredivided into three types based on the homology and structuralanalysis of core gene clusters (see Table S3 and Fig. S1 in thesupplemental material) (36). Here, genome sequence analysisshowed that two gene clusters (GenBank accession numbersKF678349 and KF678350) encoding putative T6SSs exist in thegenome of APEC K1 strain TW-XM, named the T6SS1 and T6SS2clusters (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic analyses of VgrG proteins sug-gested that the T6SS2 clusters encoded in E. coli genomes could bedivided into the intestinal pathogenic group and the extraintesti-nal pathogenic group (see Fig. S1A). Therefore, we speculated thatthese two T6SS2 groups may perform different functions in intes-tinal pathogenic and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC),T6SSs and Pathogenic PathwaysSeptember 2014 Volume 82 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3869http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=KF678349http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=KF678350http://iai.asm.orgrespectively. Furthermore, the Hcp (XmtA), VgrG, and PAARproteins of T6SS2 in ExPEC are significantly different from thoseof intestinal pathogenic E. coli (see Fig. S1B), which also suggeststhat T6SS2 may perform specific functions in ExPEC. The infor-mation above provides us an opportunity to research the func-tional mechanisms of T6SS1 and T6SS2.Identification of functional T6SS1 and T6SS2. The quality in-spection of protein samples was performed by Western blottingwith Crp or \ufffd-actin antibodies (see Fig. S2 in the supplementalmaterial). The purified proteins of VgrG and Hcp were used aspositive controls (see Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 2A, incubationwith anti-VgrG-T6SS1 led to the detection of protein bands of theexpected size for VgrG-T6SS1 in the total lysate of the wild-typeand complementation strains but not in that of mutant strain\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1. Surprisingly, VgrG-T6SS2 proteins were detectedonly in the lysates of complementation strains, not in \ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 and TW-XM (Fig. 2B). This phenomenon might be due tothe activation of some T6SS requiring bacterial endocytosis byhost cells (22, 37).Hcp family proteins can be secreted via a T6SS-dependentpathway (38\u201340) and were found not only in culture supernatantsbut also in the cytosol and membrane of human epithelial cells(26). The Hcps could also be detected in the culture supernatants(incubation with host cells) by immunoblotting using anti-Hcpserum (Fig. 2C and D) in this study, which suggested that T6SSmachinery had been assembled successfully. As shown in Fig. 2C,Hcp-T6SS1 was detected in all samples of TW-XM and culturesupernatants of \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 but was not found in the cytoplasmof DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells infected by \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1. A similarresult was obtained in studies of the Hcp-T6SS2 protein (Fig. 2D).These results indicated that the inactivation of VgrG proteins didnot destroy the secretion tube of T6SS but led to a defect in exportof effectors into host cells. These results above indicated that theT6SS1 and T6SS2 loci in the TW-XM strain encode two functionalT6SSs.T6SS1 contributes to biofilm formation. To examine whetherthe T6SS was involved in biofilm formation or not, wild-type andmutant strains were tested for their ability to form biofilms onpolystyrene surfaces as previously described (41, 42). Thegrowth rates of T6SS-associated mutants were similar to thoseof the wild-type strain (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental mate-rial). The biofilm formation ability of T6SS1-associated mu-tants in LB medium supplemented with fibrinogen was signif-icantly decreased (\ufffd45%) compared with that of the wild-typestrain TW-XM (P \ufffd 0.01) (Fig. 3; see also Fig. S5). Althoughthe biofilm formation ability did not reach the level of that ofthe wild-type strain, it was restored in the C\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1strain (Fig. 3A). Since most virulence factors contributing tobiofilm formation could induce intercellular autoaggregation(42), it could be inferred that the inactivation of T6SS1 reducedautoaggregation of APEC strain TW-XM. However, T6SS2 didnot affect the biofilm formation.T6SS1 is involved in bacterial competitions. The analysis byRussell et al. (43) suggested that the type VI lipase effector 4 (Tle4)family proteins might have antibacterial activity, like any otherphospholipases encoded in T6SS loci. The Tle4 proteins are unitedby a broad sporadic distribution pattern within Gram-negativebacteria (Fig. 4A). The T6SS1 cluster of APEC also encodes a Tle4family protein and its immunity protein Tli4 (Fig. 4B); the aminoacid identity between XmoI and Tle4 (YP_542179, E. coli UTI89)was \ufffd90%. To explore the role of Tle4 and T6SS1 in interbacterialinteractions more thoroughly, we measured their influence oncompetition outcomes between APEC and a model T6SS1 target,E. coli MG1655. Our results showed that both Tle4 and T6SS1significantly contributed to the fitness of APEC in interpathotypecompetition under T6SS-conducive conditions (Fig. 4C). Thesefindings show that Tle4 is a potent antibacterial effector deliveredby T6SS1. Using cocultured antibiotic derivatives of this strain,we found that recipient strains lacking Tle4 and its putativeimmunity determinant exhibited significantly decreased fitnessin competition with donor strains possessing Tle4 and func-tional T6SS1 and that expression of Tli4 in the recipient strainwas necessary (Fig. 4D).T6SS1 and T6SS2 play an important role in pathogenicity ofAPEC in vivo. The virulence of the wild-type, mutant, andcomplementation strains was evaluated in the duck and mousemodels. The virulence of T6SS1-associated mutants was signif-icantly lower than that of the wild-type strain, and the comple-mentation strain restored the virulence to the level of thewild-type strain. The LD50 values of the mutant strains \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 and \ufffdT6SS1, wild-type strain, and complementationstrain were 1.56 \t 106, 2.38 \t 106, 2.05 \t 105, and 3.19 \t 105CFU/duck (see Table S4 in the supplemental material), respec-tively. A similar trend was observed for T6SS2-associated mu-tants, although the difference did not reach significance,whereas the survival time was significantly longer (Fig. 5A).Within 48 h, no duck infected with the wild-type strain sur-vived, and only 37.5% of ducks remained alive in the C\ufffdVgrG-FIG 1 Schematic diagram of the genetic organization of TW-XM T6SS gene clusters. Genes encoding conserved domain proteins are represented by the samecolors. Silver arrows refer to other genes included in the T6SS loci that were not identified as part of the conserved core described by Boyer et al. (57). The directionof the arrows indicates the direction of transcription. The color keys for the functional classes of genes in the T6SS loci are shown at the bottom. The database ofClusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins was obtained from the NCBI.Ma et al.3870 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=YP_542179http://iai.asm.orgT6SS2 group, whereas 62.5% and 60.0% of ducks infected with\ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 and \ufffdT6SS2, respectively, survived (Fig. 5A).The mouse model displayed a similar result (see Table S5).Different pathogenic pathways of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in vivo.To determine the effect of T6SSs in vivo, systemic infection exper-iments were performed according to the method described previ-ously (25). As shown in Fig. 5B, the amount of bacteria in all of thefour studied organs was significantly reduced in duck incubatedwith the T6SS1-associated mutants, compared with wild-typestrain (P \ufffd 0.05). As for the strain T6SS2-associated mutants, nosignificant differences (P \ufffd 0.05) were presented statistically;those two mutants did not affect the bacterial accumulation inblood, lungs, and spleens (Fig. 5B); the differences were not sta-tistically significant (P \ufffd 0.05). Only in the brain were the bacteriasignificantly reduced with the T6SS1-associated mutants com-pared with TW-XM (P \ufffd 0.05). These results suggested thatT6SS1 was involved in the process of systemic infection by APECstrain TW-XM, whereas T6SS2 was linked only with cerebral in-fection.The T6SSs contribute to APEC\u2019s adherence to and invasionof DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells. The capacities for adherence to andinvasion of host cells were compared among the wild type, mu-tants, and complementation strains under the same conditions.The T6SS1-associated mutants were defective in binding to andinvasion of DF-1 (P \ufffd 0.01) and bEnd.3 (P \ufffd 0.05) cells (Fig. 6).In contrast, the adherence and invasion abilities of T6SS2-associ-ated mutants were not affected in DF-1 and showed a significantreduction only in bEnd.3 (P \ufffd 0.01) (Fig. 6). These results indi-cated that T6SS1 is involved in APEC adherence to and invasion ofa broad range of host cells. However, T6SS2 bound to and invadedonly bEnd.3, which supported the hypothesis that T6SS2 plays animportant role in the bacterial interaction with the blood-brainbarrier.Inactivation of T6SSs downregulated the expression of viru-lence genes in APEC. Several microbial determinants, such asOmpA, Ibe proteins, tsh, and type 1 fimbriae (fimC), contributedto the invasion phenotype (25, 44, 45). Thus, the expression pro-filing of virulence genes associated with invasion and adherenceFIG 2 Expression levels of VgrGs and Hcps in different strains were studied by immunoblotting.

As shown in Fig. 7, the expressionlevels of the virulence factors fimC, tsh, and luxS were significantlydecreased in T6SS1-associated mutants (P \ufffd 0.05). The expres-sion levels of the virulence genes were restored in the complemen-tation strain C\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1. In contrast, only ibeA of T6SS2-associated mutants showed a significant decrease in geneexpression levels compared with those in TW-XM (P \ufffd 0.05), andits level was restored in the complementation strain.VgrG-T6SS2 protein specifically binds to BMECs (bEnd.3).To analyze the binding competence of the VgrG-T6SS1 and VgrG-T6SS2 proteins for DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells, an indirect ELISA and aWestern blotting assay were performed. These two VgrG proteinsshowed a positive reaction with bEnd.3 cells, whereas only VgrG-T6SS1 showed a strong binding with DF-1 cells (Fig. 8). The con-sistent results of ELISA (Fig. 8A) and Western blotting (Fig. 8B)indicated that the putative receptor of VgrG-T6SS2 may exist onlyon the BMEC surface, whereas the receptor of VgrG-T6SS1 maybe widely distributed on the surfaces of various cell species.DISCUSSIONType VI secretion systems are bacterial nanoinjection machinesthat transport macromolecules into neighboring prokaryotic oreukaryotic cells. The toxic effector molecules serve to outcompeteother bacterial species (31, 46) or to alter host cells during patho-genesis (47\u201349). Many bacterial genomes encode more than oneT6SS, and it is currently unclear whether they are functionallyredundant or are both required for a specific niche (10, 50, 51).Here, we report the existence of two T6SS pathogenicity islands inAPEC and demonstrate their functions. Especially, T6SS2 can besignificantly divided into the intestinal pathogenic group and theextraintestinal pathogenic group. The special functions of T6SS2in these two different groups still remain unknown.The core genes and cluster structures of T6SS1 and T6SS2 inAPEC have been described in our previous research (36). Thefunctions of these T6SSs are shown by the secretion of the hall-mark hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and valine-glycine re-peat G (VgrG), whereas specific features of T6SS1 and T6SS2 arenot the same. Different pathogenic pathways of T6SS1 and T6SS2FIG 3 Biofilm assays of bacteria grown in LB supplemented with fibrinogen using 24-well microtiter plates. Biofilms were cultivated and quantified as describedin the text. (A) Results shown are mean values of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate. The error bars stand for standard deviations. Theexpression of vgrG-T6SS1 and the complete T6SS1 cluster led to significantly increased biofilm formation (P \ufffd 0.01).

The deletion of VgrGs led to the absenceof Hcps in the cytosol and the membrane of DF-1 and bEnd.3 cellsinfected by bacteria. These results indicated that VgrG family pro-teins play a key role in puncturing the host cell membrane andexporting Hcps into the cytoplasm. However, no evidence indi-cated that Hcp-T6SS2 was transported into DF-1 cells. Our datahad identified that VgrG-T6SS2 expression could be activated byDF-1 cells. However, the surface of DF-1 cells might not be boundby VgrG-T6SS2, a finding which seemed to suggest the key role ofVgrGs in host cell recognition and explained why Hcp-T6SS2 wasnot transported into DF-1 cells.There are some VgrG variants that harbor C-terminal effectordomains, such as the RtxA actin cross-linking domain of V. chol-erae VgrG1 and the actin-ADP-ribosylating domain of Aeromonashydrophila VgrG1 (52). In comparison to the better-studied ho-mologues, the C termini of VgrGs in APEC strain TW-XM aremuch smaller, and there is no bioinformatic indication that theycould harbor active domains. Here, we found that these twoVgrGs were not involved in apoptosis and cytoskeleton rearrange-ments of DF-1 and bEnd.3 (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental mate-rial), which indicated that they do not have functions similar tothose of other known VgrG homologues. Currently, we are tryingto understand the nature of this interaction and its biologicalfunctions.In enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), the T6SS (sciZ) mutantcauses a reduction in biofilm formation compared with the wild-type strain (38). In this study, T6SS1 also functioned in regulationof biofilm formation. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that inacti-vation of T6SS1 leads to decreased luxS expression. The luxS geneplays a vital role in biofilm formation, motility, and quorum sens-ing (53), which could be a major reason for the decreased biofilmformation in T6SS1-associated mutants. On another hand, thismultipurpose T6SS1 is also involved in competition proliferationof bacteria.

APEC uti-lizes a dedicated immunity protein, Tli4, to protect against endog-enous and intercellularly transferred Tle4.The T6SSs and their VgrGs were necessary for the full virulence ofAPEC strain TW-XM. The LD50s of T6SS1-associated mutants wereincreased compared with those of the wild-type strain in duck andmouse models. The survival time of the animal models infected withT6SS2-associated mutants was significantly longer than those for thewild-type or complementation strains. The inactivation of VgrG-T6SS1 and T6SS1 led to a decrease of fimC, tsh, and luxS expression,which might be responsible for the phenomenon of the mutantstrains reducing invasion capacity (3). Previous research has shownthat the inactivation of T6SS (Hcp) could result in reduced type 1fimbria expression and decreased pathogenicity in APEC (14). Inaddition, the inactivation of VgrG-T6SS2 and T6SS2 leads only todecreased expression of ibeA, which plays a vital role in penetratingthe blood-brain barrier. Reduced expression of adherence-associatedgene ibeA mutants could be an important reason for the decreasedproliferation capacity in the brain.FIG 5 In vivo infection study.

The bars in the middle of columnsindicate the average number of bacteria recovered from the organ for each group of animals.

T6SS2 was specifically involved in cerebral infec-tion of APEC. The invasion by T6SS2-associated mutants was sig-nificantly decreased in bEnd.3 cells, whereas it was unaltered inDF-1 cells. A similar finding that the E. coli K1 invasion of endo-thelial cells was specific to BMECs has been reported, and no in-vasion characteristics were observed for nonbrain endothelial cells(54).

Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene dnaE. Results are shown as relativeexpression ratios compared with expression in the parental strain TW-XM.

(A) Expression levels of ompA, fimC, tsh, ibeA, luxS, and kpsS in strains TW-XM, \ufffdVgrG-T6SS1, \ufffdT6SS1, and C\ufffdVgrG-T6SS1 were measured byqRT-PCR, and differences between TW-XM and mutants were statistically significant at a P value of \ufffd0.05. (B) Expression levels of ompA, fimC, tsh, ibeA, luxS,and kpsS in strains TW-XM, \ufffdVgrG-T6SS2, \ufffdT6SS2, and C\ufffdVgrG-T6SS2 were measured by qRT-PCR, and the differences between TW-XM and mutants werestatistically significant at a P value of \ufffd0.05.T6SSs and Pathogenic PathwaysSeptember 2014 Volume 82 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3875http://iai.asm.orgsulted only in a significant decrease in the number of viable bac-teria in brains compared with that of TW-XM, whereas the pro-liferation capacity for the other three tissues has no significantdifference. Thus, it could be concluded that T6SS2 is involved inAPEC invasion of BMECs, whereas it does not contribute to sys-temic infection. These results are also consistent with those fromqRT-PCR analysis.However, VgrG-T6SS1 and T6SS1 displayed no specific selec-tivity to target cells and were involved in the invasion of a varietyof organs. The invasion capacity of T6SS1-associated mutants wassignificantly decreased in both DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells. The dele-tion of vgrG-T6SS1 and the T6SS1 core cluster resulted in signifi-cantly reduced numbers of bacteria reisolated from all four tissuescompared with those of the wild-type strain. Although the de-crease of viable bacteria in blood circulation and systemic organsmay lead to a lower risk of brain infection, the significantly weakercapacity for adherence to and invasion of bEnd.3 cells could alsojustify the effect of T6SS1 on cerebral proliferation.However, the correlation of inactivation of T6SS1 with cere-bral proliferation could not be confirmed by these results, becausethe decrease of viable bacteria in blood circulation and systemicorgans may also lead to a lower risk of brain infection.The functional difference of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in APEC addssomething new to the growing repertoire of T6SS regulationmechanisms and phenotypes. In this study, we found that thebinding competences of VgrG-T6SS1 and VgrG-T6SS2 for DF-1and bEnd.3 cells are significantly different. VgrG-T6SS2 can spe-cifically recognize and bind to the surface of BMECs, whereas itdoes not bind DF-1 cells. In contrast, the receptors of VgrG-T6SS1were nonspecific or ubiquitous in most cell lines, including DF-1and bEnd.3 cells, and even HeLa cells in a previous study (14, 55).The similarity between the gp27 domain of VgrG protein and thetail fiber protein of bacteriophage has been shown previously (10,18). The tail fiber protein of a tailed phage has the receptor bindingfunction and decides the host specificity of the phage (21, 56). Theexperimental results above suggested that T6SSs have significanthost specificity and share a similar mechanism with bacterio-phage. Similar results have been analyzed in our previous studies(36); the absence of four important \ufffd-sheets in the gp27 domainof VgrG-T6SS1 caused a more positive electrostatic potential,which would confer a lower degree of host specificity and allowVgrG to bind multiple different host cell species.In summary, two distinguishable and functional T6SSs, multi-purpose T6SS1 and conservative T6SS2 (Fig. 9), were reported inthis study in APEC K1 isolates. Moreover, the pivotal role of VgrGproteins in recognition/binding-sensitive cells was specificallyshown for the first time, which revealed that T6SS1 and T6SS2 ofAPEC function in different pathogenic pathways.
