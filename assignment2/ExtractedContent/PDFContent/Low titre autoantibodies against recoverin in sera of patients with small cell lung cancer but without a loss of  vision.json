IntroductionParaneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS)are rare neurological disorders that are related tocancer, even though the primary tumor and itsmetastases have not invaded the nervous system.PNS are thought to be autoimmune diseases thatdevelop when malignant tumors express proteins,paraneoplastic antigens (PNA), which are nor-mally present only in neurons. PNA expressionoutside the nervous system triggers the host\u2019simmune response toward the corresponding PNAor their epitops present in neurons, resulting inthe development of PNS [1]. One of the PNS iscancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), a paraneo-plastic ocular disorder characterized by progres-sive retinal degeneration and as a result by a lossof vision [2].The first indication that the retinal protein withan apparent molecular weight 23-kDa could be \u2018aCAR antigen\u2019 was obtained by Thirkill [2]. Morerecently [3] the CAR antigen was shown to behomologous to a retinal Ca2+-binding protein,p26 or recoverin, almost simultaneously discov-ered by our and other groups [4\u20136]. Four poten-tial Ca2+-binding sites of the EF-hand type arepresent in a recoverin molecule of which only two(the 2nd and the 3rd ones) are capable of bindingcalcium ions [5,7]. The immunopathogenic regionof recoverin (residues 64\u201370) is contained withinthe 2nd EF-hand structure [8].Only a small number of CAR patients with afew kinds of cancer (endothelial carcinoma [9],breast cancer [10], epithelial ovarian carcinoma[11]) have so far been found to contain anti-recov-erin autoantibodies (RAbs) in their serum. As forlung cancers, the majority of RAbs-positive CARcases have been revealed in patients with the mostmalignant lung tumor of neuroendocrine origin,small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [2,3,8,12,13];only one similar case has been described for apatient with non-small lung carcinoma [14], thetumor of bronchial epithelial origin.It should be stressed that the common featureof all anti-recoverin-positive patients describedearlier, irrespective of the type of cancer, is thepresence of both the CAR syndrome and hightitres (as a rule, more than 1:1000) of the underly-ing autoantibodies in their serum [2,3,9\u201314]. Inthis study, we have used recombinant myristoy-lated recoverin to screen serum samples of 50patients with SCLC by Western blot and haverevealed five patients with low titres \u2014 from 1:20to 1:160 \u2014 of anti-recoverin antibodies, whohave no manifestation of a loss of vision. None ofsera of the other 45 patients with SCLC and of 30healthy individuals contain RAbs.To our knowledge, this is the first report on thepresence of low titre autoantibodies against recov-erin in a serum of patients with cancer, but with-out any evidence of visual dysfunction.2. Materials and methodsSerum samples were prepared from wholeblood of 50 patients with SCLC and of 30 healthyindividuals and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Normal pooledhuman sera were used as a negative control.Recombinant myristoylated recoverin was ob-tained according to [15] and was used in Westernblot analysis (see below). Rabbit polyclonal(monospecific) anti-recoverin antibodies were pre-pared as described in [4,5] and were used as apositive control in Western blot analysis.Western blot analysis was performed with rock-ing at room temperature after SDS-PAGE [16] ofrecombinant myristoylated recoverin (2 \ufffdg pertrack) in 12% gel. The gel slabs were electrotrans-ferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose mem-A.V. Bazhin et al. / Lung Cancer 34 (2001) 99\u2013104 101branes (Amersham) in Tris\u2013glycine\u2013methanolbuffer, pH 8.3. Then nonspecific sites were satu-rated by incubation for 1.5 h with 10% solution ofdelipidated powdered milk and membranes wereincubated for 12 h with: (i) a serum of SCLCpatients; (ii) a serum of healthy individuals as anegative control (initial dilution was 1:20 in bothcases); and (iii) rabbit\u2019s polyclonal (monospecific)anti-recoverin antibodies (1 \ufffdg/ml) as a positivecontrol. All incubations were performed in bufferB (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl,0.05% TWEEN-20, 1 mM CaCl2). Blots wererinsed three times (each for 10 min) with buffer B,incubated for 1.5 h with sheep anti-human IgGperoxidase conjugate (Amersham) at dilution of1:500 with buffer B, rinsed again with 50 mMTris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6 and finally incubated with 10mM 3,3\ufffd-diaminobenzidine as a substrate in 0.01%hydrogen peroxide.3. ResultsIn the process of raising antibodies againstrecoverin, we measured a level of the antibodies inthe serum of two rabbits after recoverin injectionand found that the maximal levels were differentin each animal. Investigation of an eye bottomand light microscopy of retina slices detected reti-nal degeneration in the rabbit with a high titre ofthe antibodies, whereas the eye characteristics ofthe rabbit with the low titres did not differ fromthose of the control animals (data not shown).The finding that anti-recoverin antibodies circu-lated in the blood stream of the experimentalanimal without causing retina degeneration stimu-lated us to screen serum samples of patients withSCLC irrespective of the presence of the CARsyndrome in them.We have screened 50 patients with diagnosisSCLC and revealed five patients with RAbs intheir sera before treatment (Fig. 1 and Table 1); innone of the cases a loss of vision has been mani-fested. When \u2018exogeneous\u2019 recoverin was used as acompetitor for RAbs binding to recoverin on theblot, the intensity of the reaction was supressed inan exogeneous recoverin-dependent manner (notshown). None of serum samples of the other 45patients with SCLC and of 30 healthy individualsinvestigated as a negative control contain RAbs.Determination of the RAbs titres in the RAbs-positive patients mentioned gave values in therange between 1:20 and 1:160. It is interesting tonote that chemotherapy caused disappearance ofRAbs from the blood stream of 3 patients investi-gated. In one case (patient coded \u2018SCLC-4\u2019), whenthe analysis was repeated 3 months after the lastcourse of chemotherapy, RAbs appeared again inthe patient\u2019s serum (see Table 1).The example of the RAbs titre determination inpatient SCLC-4 is shown in Fig. 2. One can seethat the intensity of staining of the recoverinbands decreases with the increase of the serumdilution. The band can be detected at the dilutionbetween 1:10 and 1:80, but it fully disappears atfurther dilution; the titre of RAbs in this case isestimated at 1:40.4. Case reportIn all five RAbs-positive cases revealed, thediagnosis of the extensive stage of SCLC wasestablished by physical examination, plain chestradiography, bronchoscopy with brushed biopsywith the subsequent histological and cytologyanalyses. The visual acuity of all the patientsremained immutable in comparison with that be-fore the disease and during the whole observationperiod. However, only one patient coded asFig. 1.

That is why the description of patientSCLC-4 is the only one presented in Section 4.Patient SCLC-4, a 58-year-old man was admit-ted to the Pulmonology Research Institute,Moscow in June 2000. He had been smoking 40cigarettes per day for 48 years. First symptoms ofthe disease appeared 3 months before the diagno-sis of SCLC. He complained of a cough withmucopurulent sputum, fever about 37\u00b0C, exer-tional dyspnea, a loss of voice and progressiveweakness. At the moment of the 1st blood sam-pling for the RAbs analysis, the diagnosis was theextensive stage of SCLC. The tumor obturatedthe left upper lobe bronchus involving the leftmain bronchus and did not reach the carina to 3cm. There were methastases into ipsilateral hilarlymphatic nodes, ipsilateral and contralateral me-diastinal nodes, ipsilateral supraclavicularlymphatic nodes and pancreas. The patient hadno loss of vision before the disease and during thewhole observation period. Ophtalmological inves-tigation was carried out about 5 months after thediagnosis at the moment of the last serum sam-pling when the RAbs titre was equal to 1:40 (seeTable 1). The patient\u2019s visual acuity was deter-mined as OD 0.5 and OS 1.0. Ophtalmoscopyrevealed the retina and optic nerve to be normalin appearance. Reaction of pupils to light wasnormal. The patient had no narrowing of thevisual field (Fig. 3). Thus, the manifestation ofretina degeneration was not found.5. DiscussionThe symptoms of PNS can be manifested longbefore the clinical diagnosis of the underlyingtumor, thus enabling the clinician to predict thefuture development of a particular cancer [17]. Itis postulated that the reason for the PNS develop-ment is an expression of PNA in the tumor local-ized outside the nervous system that triggers animmune response toward the corresponding PNApresent in neurons [1]. PNS are shown to beFig. 2.

Althougha number of PNS is developed in patients withSCLC, their frequency is quite rare: the totalamount of various PNS associated with SCLC isestimated at 4% [18]. One of the most extensivelystudied groups of PNA is a family of Hu antigens,autoantibodies against which underlie a multifo-cal neurological disease, paraneoplastic sensoryneuropathy [19]. The frequency of PNS in anti-Hu-positive patients with SCLC having high titresof the autoantibodies and corresponding PNS, isequal only to 1% [20]. However, SCLC patientswith low titres of anti-Hu autoantibodies andwithout PNS have been found, and the frequencyof these cases lying in the range of 15\u201320% [21], isfar above that of the high titre anti-Hu cases. Thepresence of anti-PNA antibodies in the absence ofPNS syndromes has also been demonstrated forYo and Ri antigens, but here autoantibodies weredetected only in 2\u20134% of the patients [22].Inregard to recoverin, to our knowledge, this studyis the first one to describe SCLC patients (as wellas those with other cancers) when low titres ofRAbs have been revealed in the patients\u2019 serumwithout any evidence of visual dysfunction inthem. So far we have found five patients of thistype among 50 SCLC patients investigated,whereas sera of the other 45 patients with SCLCand of 30 healthy individuals have no RAbs.Thus, the frequency of the RAbs low titre casescan be preliminary estimated as 10%. It should bestressed that this number corresponds to the mea-surements made before the treatment becausechemotherapy causes disappearance of RAbsfrom the blood stream (see Table 1) presumablydue to repression of the patients\u2019 immune activity.AcknowledgementsWe are indebted to Professor G.I.
