"Honokiol activates AMP-activated protein kinase in breast cancer cells via an LKB1-dependent pathway and inhibits breast carcinogenesisRESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessHonokiol activates AMP-activated protein kinasein breast cancer cells via an LKB1-dependentpathway and inhibits breast carcinogenesisArumugam Nagalingam1, Jack L Arbiser2, Michael Y Bonner2, Neeraj K Saxena3 and Dipali Sharma1*AbstractIntroduction: Honokiol, a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from magnolia species, is widely known for itstherapeutic potential as an antiinflammatory, antithrombosis, and antioxidant agent, and more recently, for itsprotective function in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we sought to examine theeffectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlyingmolecular mechanisms.Methods: Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cellgrowth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells wasevaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedancesensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examineactivation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breastcancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in thebiologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouseembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts,immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used.Results: Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of thedownstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation ofp70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null andAMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly,we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressorLKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important,inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition ofbreast tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 andphospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors.Conclusions: Taken together, these data provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of theLKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion,honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.* Correspondence: dsharma7@jhmi.edu1Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine andthe Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins,Baltimore MD 21231Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleNagalingam et al.

About 226,870 new cases of invasive breast cancerand about 63,300 new cases of carcinoma in situ will bediagnosed in 2012, according to the latest estimates forbreast cancer in the United States by American CancerSociety. Despite major advances in screening programsand development of various targeted therapeuticapproaches, mortality related to breast cancer still remainsat a staggering high level, with approximately 1 in 35women dying of breast cancer. Available therapies, includ-ing radiation, endocrine, and conventional chemotherapy,are often limited by high toxicity, lower efficacy, therapeu-tic resistance, and therapy-related morbidity. Therefore,more-effective therapeutic strategies are clearly needed tocombat breast cancer and to reduce morbidity andmortality.The importance of active constitutive agents in naturalproducts has become increasingly apparent, owing to theirpotential cancer preventive as well as therapeutic proper-ties [1,2]. In traditional Asian medicine, root and stembark of Magnolia species have been used for centuries totreat anxiety, nervous disorders, fever, gastrointestinalsymptoms, and stroke [3]. Therapeutic benefits of Magno-lia species have been attributed to honokiol, a natural phe-nolic compound isolated from an extract of seed conesfrom Magnolia grandiflora [3,4]. Honokiol has shownantithrombocytic, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antioxi-dant, and anxiolytic effects, and it may prove beneficialagainst hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, thrombosis, andangiopathy [3]. Two pioneering studies showing theremarkable inhibitory effects of honokiol on mouse skin-tumor promotion and demonstrating efficacy of honokiolagainst established tumors in mice [5,6] ascertained theanticancer potential of honokiol. Subsequent studiesshowed the anticancer activities of honokiol in many can-cer cell lines and tumor models [7-11].Honokiol has been found to alter many cellular pro-cesses and to modulate molecular targets that are knownto affect apoptosis, growth, and survival of tumor cells. Areview of previous studies suggests that the mechanismby which honokiol causes growth arrest and cell deathmay be cell-line/tumor-type specific and involve manysignaling pathways. For instance, Bax upregulation hasbeen observed in some but not in other cellular systems[7,12]. Honokiol decreases phosphorylation of ERK, Akt,and c-Src to induce apoptosis effectively in SVR angiosar-coma cells [3], inhibits the ERK signaling pathway toexert antiangiogenesis activity [13], but activates ERK incortical neurons to induce neurite outgrowth [14,15]. Inchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), honokiol causesapoptosis through activation of caspase 8, followed bycaspase 9 and 3 activation [7]. Honokiol-mediatedincreased cleavage of Mcl-1 and downregulation of XIAPas well as BAD upregulation is observed in multiple mye-loma, whereas Bid, p-Bad, Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xLremain unchanged [12]. Honokiol also inhibits the NF-\ufffdB signaling pathway, thus affecting expression of manydownstream genes in endothelial cells, human mono-cytes, lymphoma, embryonic kidney cells, promyelocyticleukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, cervical can-cer, and head and neck cancer [16-19]. Thus, honokiolelicits several cellular responses and modulates multiplefacets of signal transduction.In the present study, we specifically investigated theeffect of honokiol on the malignant properties of breastcancer cells, including migration and invasion, and alsoexamined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Intri-guingly, we discovered that honokiol increases theexpression of tumor-suppressor LKB1 to modulate thesignaling pathway involving the AMPK-pS6K axis. Wedirectly tested the requirement of AMPK and LKB1 inhonokiol-mediated inhibition of malignant properties ofbreast cancer cells. Our results showed that LKB1 andAMPK are integral molecules required for honokiol-mediated modulation of 4EBP1-pS6K and inhibition ofmigration and invasion of breast cancer cells.Materials and methodsCell culture and reagentsThe human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from the American Type CultureCollection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bioproducts,Woodland, CA, USA) and 2 \u03bcM L-glutamine (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell-line authentication was doneby analysis of known genetic markers or response (forexample, expression of estrogen receptor and p53 andestrogen responsiveness) [20]. AMPK-null and AMPK-WT immortalized MEFs were kindly provided by Dr.Keith R. Laderoute (SRI International, Menlo Park, CA,USA) [21]. Honokiol is a natural product extracted fromseed cone of Magnolia grandiflora, as previouslydescribed [6]. Antibodies for p-AMPK (phospho-AMPK),AMPK, ACC, p-ACC (phospho-ACC), pS6K, p-pS6K(phospho-S6K), 4EBP1, p-4EBP1 (phospho-4EBP1),p-Akt (phospho-Akt), Akt, and LKB1 (3047) were pur-chased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,USA).LKB1 stable knockdown using lentiviral short-hairpin RNAFive pre-made lentiviral LKB1 short-hairpin RNA(shRNA) constructs and a negative control constructcreated in the same vector system (pLKO.1) were pur-chased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA).Nagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35Page 2 of 16Paired LKB1 stable knockdown cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) were generated by following our previouslypublished protocol [22].Cell-viability assayCell-viability assay was performed by estimating thereduction of XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide), by using acommercially available kit (Roche) [23]. Breast cancercells were treated with honokiol as indicated.Clonogenicity assayFor colony-formation assay [24], MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with honokiol as indicated for10 days; colonies containing > 50 normal-appearing cellswere counted.Anchorage-independent soft-agar growth assayAnchorage-independent growth of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of honokiol treatment wasdetermined by colony formation on soft agar [25]. Colo-nies were counted in five randomly selected fields at\u00d710 magnification by using Olympus IX50 invertedmicroscope.Scratch-migration assayMigration assay was performed according to our pub-lished protocol [26]. Cells were treated with honokiol asindicated. Plates were photographed after 24 and48 hours at the identical location of the initial image.Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) wound-healing assayWound-healing assay was performed by using the ECIS(Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY, USA) technology andfollowing our previously established protocol [27].Spheroid migration assayMDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells (1.5 \u00d7 104) were seeded in0.5% agar-coated plates and cultured on an orbital shaker(100 rpm) for 48 hours in a humidified atmosphere con-taining 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Intact tumor spheroids wereselected and transferred to six-well plates. The spheroidswere treated with honokiol, as indicated. After 48 hoursof incubation, spheroids were fixed with 10% bufferedformalin in PBS and stained with crystal violet. Themigration of cells from spheroids was observed under alight microscope.Invasion assayFor an in vitro model system of metastasis, Matrigel inva-sion assay [28] was performed by using a Matrigel invasionchamber from BD Biocoat Cellware (San Jose, CA, USA).The slides were coded to prevent counting bias, and thenumber of invaded cells on representative sections of eachmembrane were counted under light microscope. Thenumber of invaded cells for each experimental samplerepresents the average of triplicate wells.Western blottingWhole cell lysate [23] was prepared by scraping MCF7and MDA-MB-231 cells in 250 \u03bcl of ice-cold modifiedRIPA buffer. An equal amount of protein was resolvedon sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel, transferredto nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blot analysiswas performed. Immunodetection was performed byusing enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amer-sham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL, USA)according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Immunoprecipitation assayImmunoprecipitation of LKB1 was performed by follow-ing the previously published protocol [23] by using anti-LKB1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-STRAD antibody.Immunofluorescence and confocal imagingBreast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated infour-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA)followed by treatment with honokiol and subjected toimmunofluorescence analysis as described [22]. Fixedand immunofluorescently stained cells were imaged byusing a Zeiss LSM510 Meta (Zeiss) laser scanning con-focal system configured to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 uprightmicroscope with a 63XO (NA 1.4) plan-apochromatobjective. All experiments were performed multipletimes by using independent biologic replicates.Breast tumorigenesis assayMDA-MB-231 (5 \u00d7 106) cells in 0.1 ml of HBSS wereinjected subcutaneously into the right gluteal region of4- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice. Two weeksafter initial implantation, the animals were placed intotwo experimental groups. Mice were treated with intra-peritoneal injections of (a) control (saline and Intralipi-dor (b) honokiol, at 3 mg/mouse/day in 20% Intralipid(Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA), 3 times perweek for the duration of the experiment. Tumors weremeasured by using vernier calipers, with tumor volumecalculated by using the formula (V = a/2 \u00d7 b2), where Vis the tumor volume in cubic millimeters, and a and bare the largest and smallest diameters in millimeters,respectively. All animals were killed after 4 weeks oftreatment. Tumors were collected; weighed, fixed in10% neutral-buffered formalin; and subjected to furtheranalysis with immunohistochemistry.Nagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35Page 3 of 16Immunohistochemical analysisWe used tumor sections to determine the effect of hono-kiol on expression of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 by immu-nohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performedessentially as described by us previously for other proteins[25,26]. At least four nonoverlapping representativeimages from each tumor section from five mice of eachgroup were captured by using ImagePro software forquantitation of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 expression.Total cell lysates were prepared from tumor samples andsubjected to immunoblot analysis. All animal studies wereconducted in accordance with the guidelines of UniversityACUC.Statistical analysisAll experiments were performed thrice in triplicates. Sta-tistical analysis was performed by using Microsoft Excelsoftware. Significant differences were analyzed by usingthe Student t test and two-tailed distribution. Data wereconsidered to be statistically significant if P < 0.05. Datawere expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM between triplicate experi-ments performed thrice.ResultsHonokiol treatment inhibits clonogenicity, migration, andinvasion of breast cancer cellsGrowth-inhibition and apoptosis-induction properties ofhonokiol have been reported in several cancer cell lines[3,9-12,18]. In the current study, two breast cancer celllines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were treated with variousconcentrations ranging from 1 \u03bcM to 25 \u03bcM honokiol andsubjected to clonogenicity (Figure 1a) and anchorage-inde-pendent growth assay (Figure 1b). Dose-dependent andstatistically significant inhibition of clonogenicity and soft-agar colony formation was observed in the presence ofhonokiol. Treatment with 5 \u03bcM honokiol resulted in~50% to 60% inhibition in clonogenicity and soft-agar col-ony formation, whereas higher concentrations (10 and 25\u03bcM) were more inhibitory (Figure 1a, b). We furtherexamined the effect of honokiol on the growth ofHCC1806 breast cancer cells, which harbor an LKB1homozygous mutation, by using clonogenicity and soft-agar colony formation assay. Our studies show that hono-kiol does not inhibit the growth of HCC-1806 cells (Addi-tional file 1). These results indicate that LKB1 might be anintegral molecule for honokiol-mediated growthinhibition.Cancer progression is a multistep process that involvesinvasion of basement membrane by tumor cells andmigration to points far from a given primary tumor mass,leading to metastasis [29]. We examined the effect ofhonokiol on breast cancer cell migration and invasion byusing scratch migration, electric-cell-substrate impedancesensing (ECIS)-based migration, spheroid migration, andMatrigel invasion assays. Honokiol treatment resulted ininhibition of migration of breast cancer cells (Figure 2a)in comparison with untreated cells. For quantitativedetermination of alteration in the migration potential ofbreast cancer cells on treatment with honokiol, we per-formed a quantitative real-time impedance assay by usingan ECIS-based technique. As expected, confluent cellsshowed high resistance values. Confluent cells were sub-jected to a high-voltage pulse that resulted in decrease inresistance, indicating death and detachment of cells pre-sent on the small active electrode. Cells were leftuntreated or treated with honokiol, and changes in resis-tance were recorded for 24 hours. Control untreated cellsshowed an increase in resistance, showing increasedmigration of cells surrounding the small active electrodethat were not submitted to the elevated voltage pulse toreach the resistance values of the nonwounded cells atthe start of the experiment. Honokiol-treated cellsshowed a decrease in resistance, indicating decreasedmigration. Notably, honokiol-treated cells never reachedthe values of nonwounded cells, showing significant inhi-bition of migration potential (Additional file 2). Weexamined the effect of honokiol treatment on the migra-tory capacity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells spher-oids. Significant migration of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231cells from the spheroids was seen under untreated condi-tions. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migra-tion of cells from spheroids (Figure 2b). Next, weperformed Matrigel invasion assay to examine the effectof honokiol on the invasion potential of breast carcinomacells. As evident from Figure 2c, honokiol treatmentdecreased invasion of breast cancer cells through Matri-gel in comparison with untreated cells. Activation ofFAK has been shown to regulate cancer cell migrationand invasion through distinct pathways by promoting thedynamic regulation of focal adhesion and peripheral actinstructures [30-32] and matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs)-mediated matrix degradation [33]. We exam-ined whether honokiol treatment affects FAK activationto inhibit migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.Honokiol treatment inhibited FAK phosphorylation inbreast cancer cells, indicating the involvement of FAKactivation in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migrationand invasion potential of breast cancer cells (Figure 2d).Collectively, these results show that honokiol treatmentcan effectively inhibit clonogenicity, anchorage-indepen-dent colony formation, migration, and invasion of breastcarcinoma cells.Honokiol-induced AMPK activation plays an integral rolein honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTOR activity andmigration potential of cellsHonokiol modulates multiple pathways (nuclear factor(NF)-\ufffdB, ERK, Akt, and JNK) in a cellular process andNagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35Page 4 of 16target-tissue-dependent manner [7,9-11,19]. AMP-acti-vated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine pro-tein kinase that acts as a master sensor of cellular energybalance in mammalian cells by regulating glucose andlipid metabolism [34]. Recent studies have implicatedAMPK as an important factor in cancer cell growth andmigration [35,36]. Thus, we sought to determine theeffect of honokiol on AMPK phosphorylation and activa-tion. Honokiol treatment stimulated phosphorylation ofAMPK at Thr-172 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.Honokiol had no effect on total AMPK protein expres-sion levels (Figure 3a). AMPK phosphorylation atFigure 1 Honokiol inhibits clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells.

The number of cells that invaded through theMatrigel was counted in five different regions. The slides were blinded to remove counting bias. The histograms show the mean of threeindependent experiments performed in triplicate. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (d) Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) weretreated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 \u03bcM) for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cells. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteinswere resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated FAK. The membranes werereblotted by using total FAK antibodies as controls. The blots are representative of multiple independent experiments.Nagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35Page 6 of 16Thr-172 has been widely associated with its activation[37]. Once activated, AMPK directly phosphorylates andinactivates a number of ATP-consuming metabolicenzymes including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)[38]. We examined the phosphorylation of ACC to evalu-ate AMPK activity with honokiol treatment. Increasedphosphorylation of ACC in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231cells was observed in response to honokiol treatment ascompared with untreated cells, whereas total ACC pro-tein levels remain unchanged (Figure 3a). Activation ofAMPK leads to suppression of mammalian target ofrapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and the molecularmechanisms involve phosphorylation of tuberous sclero-sis complex protein TSC2 at Thr-1227 and Ser-1345 thatincreases the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to inhi-bit mTOR [37,39]. Two very well characterized andwidely studied downstream effectors of mTOR are thep70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1 orpS6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E(elF4E)-binding protein (4EBP1) [40]. Phosphorylation ofpS6K and 4EBP1 has been widely used to assess changesin mTOR activity in response to various growth-factorpathways. We next examined the effect of honokiol onmTOR activity in breast cancer cells. Honokiol decreasedphosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1 in both MCF7 andMDA-MB-231 cells while not affecting the total proteinlevels of pS6K and 4EBP1 (Figure 3b). Recent studieshave shown that pS6K regulates the actin cytoskeleton byacting as an actin filament cross-linking protein and as aRho family GTPase-activating protein [41]. It has beenshown that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is cri-tical for cell migration, as motile cancer cells mustassemble and disassemble the actin filaments at theirleading edges [42]. Depletion or inhibition of the activityof pS6K results in inhibition of actin cytoskeleton reorga-nization and inhibition of migration [41]. Owing to theintegral role of pS6K in cancer cell migration, it is possi-ble that honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration ismediated through pS6K inhibition.mTOR, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation,exists in two structurally and functionally distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 isknown to activate protein synthesis and cell growththrough regulating pS6K and 4E-BP1 activity, whereasmTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473, activating cellgrowth, proliferation, and survival [43,44]. We found thathonokiol increases AMPK activation and inhibitsmTORC1 function, as evidenced by inhibition of pS6Kand 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.We next determined whether honokiol treatment mod-ulates mTORC2 function. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akton Ser-473. Therefore, to determine whether mTORC2 isalso inhibited by honokiol under similar conditions,breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol, and thephosphorylation of Akt was determined. Honokiol didnot alter Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 in breast can-cer cells (Additional file 3). These results provide evi-dence that honokiol only inhibits mTORC1 in breastcancer cells. Contrasting findings have been reportedpreviously, showing reduction in Akt phosphorylation inresponse to honokiol treatment. Of note, MDA-MB-231cells were treated with much higher concentrations ofhonokiol (60, 80, and 100 \u03bcM) in this study [45]. Hence,the observed decrease in Akt phosphorylation maybe due to the treatment with higher concentrations ofhonokiol. Honokiol inhibits breast cancer growth in aconcentration-dependent manner, with higher concentra-tions much more inhibitory than lower concentrations(Figure 1).Although our findings clearly showed the involvementof AMPK activation in the honokiol signaling network,we raised the question whether honokiol-induced inhibi-tion of mTOR and cell migration requires AMPK pro-tein. We used MEFs derived from AMPK-WT (WT)and AMPK knockout (AMPK-null) mice to test thepotential requirement of this protein in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration. Immunoblotting con-firmed the absence of the AMPK protein in AMPK-nullMEFs (Figure 4a). In agreement with the absence ofAMPK protein, the AMPK-null MEFs did not show anyphosphorylation of ACC, even in the presence of hono-kiol. AMPK-WT MEFs, conversely, exhibited honokiol-stimulated phosphorylation of ACC, indicating activa-tion of AMPK (Figure 4b). Exposure of MEFs derivedfrom AMPK-WT mice to honokiol resulted in inhibitionof phosphorylation of pS6K, whereas the MEFs derivedfrom the AMPK-null mice were significantly resistant tothe honokiol-mediated inhibition of pS6K phosphoryla-tion (Figure 4d).We next asked whether AMPK is directly involved inhonokiol-mediated inhibition of migration. AMPK-WTMEFs exhibited inhibition of migration in response tohonokiol treatment in scratch migration as well asECIS-based migration assay. Interestingly, honokioltreatment could not inhibit migration of AMPK-nullMEFs (Figure 4c; Additional file 4). AMPK knockdownalso inhibited the antiproliferative effect of honokiol(Figure 4e). These results showed that AMPK is an inte-gral molecule in mediating the negative effects of hono-kiol on the mTOR axis and migration potential of cells.Inhibition of LKB1 abrogates honokiol-mediatedmodulation of AMPK and inhibition of migration andinvasion of breast cancer cellsThe tumor suppressor LKB1 (also known as Stk11) is anevolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinasethat has a broad range of cellular functions, includingtumor suppression, cell polarity, cell-cycle regulation,Nagalingam et al.

LKB1 has recentlybeen identified as a critical upstream kinase for AMPK,regulating its activity. Intriguingly, we found that hono-kiol increases expression of tumor suppressor LKB1 inMCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, with a significantincrease at 1 hour of treatment with maximal expressionat 24 hours in MCF7 cells and at 4 hours in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5a). Variable expression of LKB1 inMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells has been reported[48,49]. We recently procured MDA-MB-231 cells fromvarious established breast cancer research laboratoriesand analyzed the expression and functional status ofLKB1. Our data unequivocally showed the presence offunctional LKB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells [22]. HumanLKB1 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, but a mutant ofLKB1 lacking the nuclear localization signal still retainsthe ability to suppress cell growth, suggesting that thecytosolic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in med-iating its tumor-suppressor properties [50,51]. STRAD(Ste20-related adaptor) protein has been shown to forma complex in which STRAD activates LKB1, resulting incytoplasmic translocation of LKB1 [47]. We investigatedthe effect of honokiol on the formation of the LKB1-STRAD complex in breast cancer cells. To address thisquestion, breast cancer cells were treated with honokiolfollowed by immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antibodies.Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were analyzedfor the presence of STRAD by using Western blot ana-lysis. Higher levels of STRAD immunoprecipitated withLKB1 in the presence of honokiol indicated increasedformation of the LKB1-STRAD complex (Figure 5b).Immunostaining of honokiol-treated MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that honokiol treatment increasescytoplasmic accumulation of LKB1. LKB1 was localizedpredominantly in the nucleus in untreated breast cancercells, although cytoplasmic LKB1 expression was alsodetected (Figure 5c). Control experiments with second-ary antibody (results not shown) gave an extremely faintbackground staining that was distributed uniformlythroughout the cells, irrespective of the treatment. Stu-dies on the subcellular localization of LKB1 have indi-cated a wide variety of localization patterns. MouseLKB1 was found to be predominantly nuclear, whereasCaenorhabditis elegans PAR-4 and Xenopus XEEK1were detected exclusively in the cytoplasm [52-54].Human LKB1 has been detected to be both nuclear andcytoplasmic in several cell types [55,56]. Although LKB1expression is exclusively cytoplasmic in lung and pan-creatic cancer [57,58], gastrointestinal hamartomatouspolyps from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients, head andneck squamous cell carcinoma, invasive lobular breastcarcinoma, and solid papillary ductal carcinoma in situbreast cancer show both cytoplasmic and nuclear LKB1expression [59-61]. Studies in adult rat primarycardiomyocytes and C2C12 myoblasts showed thatLKB1 was located predominantly in nucleus and under-goes cytoplasmic localization in various stimulations[62-64]. In vitro studies suggest that nuclear LKB1 regu-lates cell-cycle progression and acts as a transcriptionfactor [65,66], whereas cytoplasmic LKB1 participates incontrolling energy metabolism and cell polarity [67]. Itis not completely understood how subcellular localiza-tion of LKB1 affects its tumor-suppressor function andactivation of other signaling pathways in vivo.We raised the question whether LKB1 plays an impor-tant regulatory role in honokiol- mediated modulation ofAMPK and inhibition of migration and invasion of breastcancer cells. To address these questions, we usedLKB1shRNA lentivirus and puromycin to select for stablepools of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with LKB1 deple-tion. We analyzed pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA stable MCF7and MDA-MB-231 cell pools for LKB1 protein expressionwith immunoblot analysis and found that LKB1 proteinexpression was significantly reduced in LKB1shRNA cells(shRNA1 and shRNA2) as compared with pLKO.1 controlcells (Figure 5d). pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells were trea-ted with honokiol, and phosphorylation of AMPK wasdetermined by using Western blot analysis. We found thathonokiol increased phosphorylation of AMPK in pLKO.1cells. Intriguingly, displaying a crucial role of LKB1, hono-kiol treatment did not change the phosphorylation levelsof AMPK in LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5e). Invasion andmigration are the key biologic features of malignant beha-vior of carcinoma cells [29]. In addition to examining theeffect of LKB1 depletion on honokiol-induced modulationof AMPK, we also examined the requirement of LKB1 inhonokiol-mediated inhibition of metastatic properties ofbreast cancer cells. As evident from Figure 5f, honokioltreatment efficiently inhibited migration of pLKO.1 cells,whereas untreated pLKO.1 cells showed increased migra-tion. Our results showed that LKB1shRNA cells exhibitedincreased migration in the absence of honokiol treatment.Interestingly, honokiol treatment did not inhibit themigration of LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5f). We next exam-ined the effect of honokiol on invasion potential ofpLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells and found that honokiolinhibited invasion of pLKO.1 cells, whereas LKB1shRNAcells were not affected by honokiol treatment (Figure 5g).These results collectively show that honokiol-inducedLKB1 overexpression is indeed a crucial component of thesignaling machinery used by honokiol in modulating theAMPK-S6K axis and inhibiting the metastatic propertiesof breast cancer cells.Honokiol treatment inhibits breast-tumor progression inathymic nude miceWe investigated the physiological relevance of our invitro findings by evaluating whether honokiol has anyNagalingam et al.

In the experimental group treatedwith honokiol, the rate of tumor growth was signifi-cantly inhibited, and the tumor size and weight weresignificantly reduced compared with control group(Figure 6a, b). The immunohistochemical assessment oftumor proliferation showed higher Ki-67 in the controlgroup as compared with the honokiol-treated group(Figure 6c). In our in vitro analyses, we discovered theinvolvement and requirement of the LKB1-AMPK axisin biologic functions of honokiol. We examined theexpression of LKB1 and p-AMPK in tumors treatedwith honokiol. Tumors treated with honokiol displayedhigher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1 (Fig-ure 6c). In addition, we examined the expression levelsof phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AMPK, ACCas well as S6K, in honokiol-treated and vehicle-treatedmice. We found higher levels of phosphorylated AMPKand ACC in honokiol-treated tumors as compared withvehicle-treated controls. Honokiol-treated tumorsshowed lower levels of phosphorylated S6K, whereasvehicle-treated controls exhibited high levels of phos-phorylated S6K (Figure 6d). These data presented directin vivo evidence of the involvement of LKB1-AMPKactivation and the subsequent inhibition of pS6K inhonokiol function (Figure 6e).DiscussionThe antitumor activity of honokiol, a natural productderived from magnolia plant and used in traditionalAsian medicine, has been reported in various preclinicalmodels [3]. In the current study, we investigated thepotential of honokiol in the inhibition of migration andinvasion of breast cancer cells and the underlying mole-cular mechanisms. The following novel findings arereported in this study: (i) honokiol treatment inhibitsmalignant properties such as invasion and migration ofbreast cancer cells; (ii) honokiol stimulates AMPK phos-phorylation and activity while reducing mTOR activity,as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of pS6K and4EBP1; (iii) AMPK protein is required for honokiol-mediated inhibition of pS6K and 4EBP1; (iv) honokiolincreases the expression and cytosolic localization oftumor suppressor LKB1, which is an essential effectormolecule to mediate the honokiol effect on the AMPK-pS6K axis and inhibition of invasion and migration ofbreast cancer cells; and (v) honokiol inhibits breasttumor growth and modulates the LKB1-AMPK-pS6Kaxis in vivo. Our results show that honokiol treatmentsignificantly inhibits malignant properties of breast can-cer cells through modulation of the LKB1-AMPK-pS6Kaxis; thus using honokiol may be a suitable therapeuticstrategy for metastatic breast cancer.Many bioactive molecules and their synthetic analo-gues have been reported to demonstrate activity againstbreast cancer [68-71]. Although the lower toxicity asso-ciated with bioactive molecules is a much desired qual-ity, their limited bioavailability hinders furtherdevelopment. Honokiol exhibits a desirable spectrum ofbioavailability, in contrast with many other natural pro-ducts [3]. The development of other polyphenolic agentshas been obstructed by poor absorption and rapid excre-tion [72]. Honokiol does not have this disability, as sig-nificant systemic levels of honokiol can be obtained inpreclinical models, and it can cross the blood-brain bar-rier [73]. These qualities of honokiol make it a promis-ing small-molecular-weight natural anticancer agent.Indeed, honokiol has been found to alter many molecu-lar targets in various cancer models to inhibit tumor cellgrowth and survival [3,6,9,10,12,19]. One of the majorfindings of this study is that the LKB1-AMPK pathwayplays a major role in mediating the effect of honokioleffect on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.AMPK, a master sensor of cellular energy balance inmammalian cells, regulates glucose and lipid metabolism[34]. Biochemical regulation of serine/threonine proteinkinase AMPK activation occurs through multiple mechan-isms [37]. AMPK undergoes a conformational change inresponse to direct binding of AMP to its nucleotide-bind-ing domain, exposing the activation loop of the catalytickinase subunit. LKB1 phosphorylates a critical threoninein this activation loop to activate AMPK. Dephosphoryla-tion by protein phosphatases also plays an important rolein regulating AMPK activity [47]. Genetic depletion ofLKB1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in aloss of AMPK activation after energy stresses that increaseAMP [37], showing the requirement of LKB1 in AMPKactivation. We found that honokiol increases AMPK acti-vation, which can be efficiently inhibited by the silencingof LKB1. AMPK represents a pivotal point in the mTORpathway regulating a vast range of cellular activities,including transcription, translation, cell size, mRNA turn-over, protein stability, ribosomal biogenesis, and cytoskele-tal organization [37]. Besides being directly activated bytumor-suppressor LKB1, AMPK itself regulates the activa-tion of two other tumor suppressors, TSC1 and TSC2,which are critical regulators of Rheb and mTOR [37]. Wefound that AMPK knockdown inhibits honokiol-mediatedmTOR inhibition. Honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTORalso suggests that honokiol and its derivatives may proveexcellent candidates as targeted therapies for carcinomascharacterized by hyperactive mTOR signaling.LKB1 kinase is a tumor suppressor and a key determi-nant in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited sus-ceptibility to gastrointestinal, lung, pancreatic, andbreast cancer [47,74]. Inactivation of the LKB1 gene hasbeen shown in a subset of sporadic lung and pancreaticNagalingam et al.

Average tumor weight and representative tumor images are shown here. (c) Tumor samples were subjectedto immunohistochemical analysis by using LKB1, p-AMPK, and Ki67 antibodies.

Honokiol stimulation induces LKB1 translocation from the nucleus into cytosol and phosphorylates AMPK,leading to increased phosphorylation of ACC and decreased phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1.Nagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35Page 13 of 16cancer. Although the loss of LKB1 expression is notcommonly observed in human breast carcinoma, it cer-tainly correlates with high-grade DCIS and high-gradeinvasive ductal carcinoma [61]. It is important to notethat LKB1 expression was not abrogated in pure DCIScases but only in the DCIS associated with invasion,indicating that loss of LKB1 could potentially promoteinvasion. Supporting this notion, low LKB1 proteinlevels have been reported to correlate with poor prog-nosis in breast carcinoma [48]. Our studies show thathonokiol treatment increases the expression and cytoso-lic localization of LKB1 in breast xenograft tumors andinhibits tumor growth. LKB1 is localized predominantlyin the nucleus, translocating to the cytosol, either byforming a heterotrimeric complex with STRAD (ste20-related adaptor protein) and MO25 (mouse protein 25)or by associating with LIP1 (LKB1-interacting protein),to exert its biologic functions [50,52,55,75,76]. The cyto-plasmic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in mediat-ing its tumor-suppressor properties. Wild-type LKB1,when co-expressed with STRAD and MO25, exhibitsincreased cytoplasmic localization, whereas mutantLKB1, unable to interact with STRAD and MO25,remains in the nucleus [75,77]. Promotion of cytosolictranslocation of LKB1 is a common mechanism to acti-vate downstream LKB1 functions, as AMPK activationby metformin, peroxynitrile, or adiponectin also involvesLKB1 cytosolic translocation [22,64,78-80]. Honokioltreatment increases LKB1-STRAD complex formation inaddition to overexpression of LKB1, thus increasing thefunctional pool of LKB1. Our study shows for the firsttime that honokiol stimulates the cytosolic translocationof LKB1 in breast cancer cells.ConclusionsWe uncovered a novel mechanism by which honokiolinhibits invasion and migration of breast cancer cells,which involves enhanced expression and cytosolic locali-zation of LKB1 and AMPK activation. We also demon-strated the requirement of LKB1 and AMPK inhonokiol-mediated inhibition of migration and invasionof breast cancer cells. Our results thus provide newinsight into the mechanisms by which honokiol, a pro-mising anticancer agent, inhibits breast carcinogenesis.Conflicting interestsAN, MYB, NKS, and DS declare no conflict of interest.JLA is listed as an inventor on patents filed by EmoryUniversity.
