"pone.0053510 1..13Chronic Morphine Treatment Attenuates Cell Growth ofHuman BT474 Breast Cancer Cells by Rearrangement ofthe ErbB Signalling NetworkInka Regine Weingaertner, Sarah Koutnik, Hermann Ammer*Institute of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, GermanyAbstractBackground: There is increasing evidence that opioid analgesics may interfere with tumour growth. It is currently thoughtthat these effects are mediated by transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-controlled ERK1/2 and Akt signalling.The growth of many breast cancer cells is dependent on hyperactive ErbB receptor networks and one of the most successfulapproaches in antineoplastic therapy during the last decade was the development of ErbB-targeted therapies. However, theresponse rates of single therapies are often poor and resistance mechanisms evolve rapidly. To date there is no informationabout the ability of opioid analgesics to interfere with the growth of ErbB-driven cancers.Methods and Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that ErbB2 overexpressing BT474 human breast cancer cells carryfully functional endogenous m-opioid receptors. Most interestingly, the acute opioid effects on basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation changed considerably during chronic Morphine treatment. Investigation of theunderlying mechanism by the use of protein kinase inhibitors and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that chronicMorphine treatment results in rearrangement of the ErbB signalling network leading to dissociation of ERK1/2 from Aktsignalling and a switch from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/ErbB2-dependent cell growth. In chronically Morphine-treated cellsHeregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is redirected via a newly established PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependentfeedback loop. Together, these alterations result in apoptosis of BT474 cells. A similar switch in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2signalling from an ErbB2-independent to an ErbB2-, PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism was also observedin k-opioid receptor expressing SKBR3 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells.Conclusions and Significance: The present data demonstrate that the ErbB receptor network of human breast cancer cellsrepresents a target for chronic Morphine treatment. Rearrangement of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine may provide apromising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to ErbB-directed therapies and to prevent thedevelopment of escape mechanisms.Citation: Weingaertner IR, Koutnik S, Ammer H (2013) Chronic Morphine Treatment Attenuates Cell Growth of Human BT474 Breast Cancer Cells byRearrangement of the ErbB Signalling Network.

They mediatetheir action via specific binding sites (d, k, m) that belong to thefamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Opioid receptors arepredominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and inhibit neuronalexcitability by regulating their \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 effector systems adenylylcyclase, potassium channels and voltage-dependent calciumcurrents [1]. Beside this, opioid receptors may also regulate theactivity of a variety of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases,including Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38, Signal Transducer andActivator of Transcription 5 (STAT5) and Protein Kinase B(PKB/Akt) [2,3]. Activation of these \u2018\u2018non classical\u2019\u2019 opioideffector systems is mediated via transactivation of receptor tyrosinekinase (RTK)-associated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways[4,5]. Due to the ability of opioid receptors to regulate thedominant RTK system in a given cellular context [6], chronicopioid treatment might provide a means to selectively interferewith tumour cell growth. Because the opioid effects on tumour cellproliferation and apoptosis reported so far are rather discrepantand role of opioid receptors in these studies was not always clear[7,8], the aim of the present study was to investigate chronicMorphine regulation of RTK-dependent cell growth in a definedtumour cell model carrying endogenous m-opioid receptors.The human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Receptor family(ErbB, also termed HER) consists of four members (ErbB1-4) andbelongs to subclass I of the superfamily of RTKs. They areactivated by more than 10 different growth factor ligands withpartly overlapping (EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-a, and Betacellulin) ormore discrete (Neuregulins) receptor specificities [9]. ErbBreceptors are transmembrane receptors consisting of an extracel-lular ligand binding domain, an intracellular kinase domain andan intracellular C-terminal tail. Ligand binding favours receptorPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510dimerization, which in turn leads to activation of the intracellularkinase domain and autophosphorylation of distinct tyrosineresidues in the C-terminal tail. These provide docking sites forbinding of the Shc/Grb2/SOS complex linking ErbB receptors toactivation of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signalling module[10]. Although structurally highly homologous, individual ErbBreceptors differ with respect to ligand binding and kinase activity.Most importantly, there is currently no endogenous ligand knownfor ErbB2 [11], whereas ErbB3 lacks catalytic tyrosine kinaseactivity [12]. Thus, both receptors must undergo heterodimeriza-tion for signalling. While ErbB2 is considered a signal amplifier,activated ErbB3 signal through their dimerization partner. InErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, ligand activation of ErbB3 results inErbB1-mediated stimulation of the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway.While all ErbB family members are able to cross-regulate the anti-apoptotic Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in aRas-dependent manner, ErbB3 may also directly activate all 3regulatory subunits of PI3K in the presence of ligand activatedbinding partners [13]. Due to the ability of ErbB receptors to formmultiple homo- and heterodimers that considerably differ in theirsignalling capacity, alterations in receptor abundance anddimerization will have dramatic consequences on mitogenic andanti-apoptotic signalling [9].Human BT474 breast cancer cells were originally isolated froma solid, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast from a 60 years oldwoman [14]. These cells are characterized by a dysregulated ErbBreceptor system, because they overexpress the ErbB2 receptor[11]. ErbB2 is present in about 25\u201330% of breast cancer patients[15] and is associated with poor prognosis and high relapse rate[11]. BT474 cells also carry physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3and low levels of ErbB4 [16], providing them a suitable modelsystem for investigating the impact of ErbB signalling on tumourcell growth and ErbB2-targeted anti-tumour strategies [17]. In thepresent study we demonstrate that BT474 cells carry endogenousm-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment attenu-ates Heregulin-induced cell growth and migration. The underlyingmechanism involves dissociation of Heregulin-induced ERK1/2and Akt signalling from a common ErbB1/ErbB3 to separateErbB1/ErbB2 and ErbB1/ErbB3 mechanisms resulting in PI3K-dependent cell growth. Similar chronic Morphine effects on ErbBsignalling were also observed in ErbB2 overexpressing SKBR3human mammary adenocarcinoma cells that carry endogenous k-opioid receptors. These results demonstrate that chronic Mor-phine treatment is able to interfere with the growth characteristicsof opioid receptor expressing tumour cells by rearrangement of theErbB receptor system. Such a mechanism might provide apromising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directedantineoplastic strategies and to prevent escape mechanisms.Materials and MethodsMaterialsFoetal calf serum and cell culture reagents were from PanBiotech.

SKBR3 cellswere obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)and grown in McCoy\u2019s 5A modified medium plus supplements asabove. For experimentation, BT474 cells were seeded onto 96-,24-, 12- and 6 well dishes as indicated at a density of 0.256104\u201356105 cells per well, left to adhere overnight and then subjected tochronic opioid treatment by the addition of Morphine (10 mM) tothe culture medium for 5 d with medium changes and drugrenewal every other day.For evaluation of membrane proteins (m-opioid and ErbBreceptors, G proteins) and radioligand binding studies, cells weregrown in 75 or 150 cm2 culture flasks and plasma membraneswere prepared as described [18]. In brief, cells were washed 3times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH7.4),scraped into 20 ml of TED buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mMEDTA, and 1 mM DTT; pH 7.4) and then homogenized for10 sec using an Ultra Turrax. After removal of unbroken cells(3006g; 10 min), membranes were recovered from the superna-tant fraction by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,0006g. Themembrane pellet was washed once as above, resuspended in TMbuffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) and stored inaliquots at 280uC until use.RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated using TrifastTMreagent (Peqlab) andtranscribed into cDNA using the Fist Strand cDNA Synthesis KitH(Fermentas) according to manufacturers protocols. Integrity ofcDNA was controlled by determination of GAPDH. Opioidreceptors (OR) and adenylyl cyclase isoforms (AC) were amplifiedusing specific primer pairs given in Table 1. All PCR reactions(50 ml) contained 10 pmol of each primer, 10 ng of cDNA,0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.25 U Pfu DNA polymerase and 20 mMMgSO4. Amplified fragments (20 ml) were resolved on a 1.5%agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized underUV light.Radioligand BindingEquilibrium binding studies were performed in triplicatedetermination for 2 h at RT in a total volume of 0.2 ml usingthe high-affinity m-opioid receptor agonist [3H]DAMGO as theradioligand (2 nM) and 200\u2013300 mg of membrane protein in TMbuffer as described [19]. Non-specific binding was determined inthe presence of 1 mM DAMGO. Reactions were stopped by rapidfiltration over WhatmanH GF/B glass fibre filters and radioactivityincorporated was determined by liquid scintillation in a BeckmanLS6500 counter (Beckman Coulter). Maximum binding capacitywas calculated according to the method of DeBlasi [20] using a Kdof 1.4 nM for the human m-opioid receptor [21].Morphine Regulation of ErbB SignallingPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510cAMP AccumulationCells grown in 24 well dishes were washed 3 times with DMEMcontaining 25 mM HEPES (DMEH) and 0.1 mM IBMX andthen incubated for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were chilled on ice andmedia were replaced by DMEH containing the followingstimulators and inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase: Forskolin (1 mM),Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM). Reactions wereconducted for 15 min at 37uC and stopped by the addition of0.75 ml 50 mM HCL per well. The amount of cAMP producedwas measured by ELISA after acetylation of the samples.Cell GrowthCells were cultured in 24 well plates for 5 (BT474) or 3(SKBR3) days in insulin-free growth medium in the absence orpresence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone (100 mM) and Here-gulin (40 ng/ml) as described [22]. Cells were then washed twicewith 0.5 ml PBS and fixed for 30 min at RT with 0.25 ml 20%methanol in PBS containing 0.1% crystal violet. The dye solutionwas aspirated, cells were washed extensively with PBS and finallysolubilised for 2 h in 0.25 ml 0.1 M citric acid per well. Colourintensity was determined after 10 fold dilution at l= 492 nm in aTecanH Spectra Multiplate Reader. Background staining obtainedfrom cells on the same plates fixed on day 0 was subtracted.Scratch AssayCell migration was evaluated using the in vitro scratch assay asdescribed [23]. BT474 cells (46105/well) were seeded onto 6 wellculture dishes containing poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips to yield90% sub confluent monolayers after 5 d of culture in the absence(control) or presence of Heregulin (40 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM)and Naloxone (100 mM) as indicated. Then, a scratch was madethrough the center of the well using a 200 ml pipette tip. Detachedcells were removed and cells were cultured for another 24 h incomplete medium containing the above ligands. Cells were thenwashed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, before cellmigration into the open area was assessed using an OlympusBH2 microscope.Cell ProliferationDNA synthesis was determined for 2 h in 96 well plates usingthe BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) accordingto the manufacturers instruction. Media were removed and cellswere stimulated for 2 h at 37uC with Heregulin b1 (40 ng/ml) andMorphine (10 mM) dissolved in 0.1 ml of insulin-deficient growthmedium containing 10 mM BrdU. Reactions were stopped; cellswere fixed and incubated with 0.1 ml anti-BrdU antibody coupledto horseradish peroxidase. After the addition of substrate, colourreaction was measurement at l= 405 nm. All experiments weredone in triplicate determination.ERK1/2 and Akt PhosphorylationCells grown in 12 well plates were washed and equilibrated for30 min at 37uC in DMEH containing 0.1% BSA before cells werestimulated for 5 min with Heregulin-b1 (40 ng/ml), EGF(100 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM) asindicated. Reactions were stopped on ice and cells were solubilizedin 0.5 ml Laemmli sample buffer. In some experiments, thefollowing protein kinase inhibitors were added during theequilibration period at the concentrations given: ErbB1 inhibitorAG1478 (5 mM), ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 (50 mM), PI3K inhibitorWortmannin (1 mM) and the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitorEGCG (10 mM). The activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt wasdetermined by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies asdescribed below.Apoptosis AssaysStress-induced apoptosis was evaluated in 12 well dishes byculturing the cells for 6 h in serum-reduced growth medium (0.5%FCS) in the absence or presence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone(100 mM) and Heregulin (40 ng/ml). Reactions were stopped byremoval of the medium and solubilisation of the cells in 0.5 mlLaemmli sample buffer. Apoptosis was determined by Westernblot using an antibody recognizing cleaved PARP.Western Blot AnalysisSamples were cleared by centrifugation (10,0006g; 5 min) andproteins were resolved by electrophoresis over 8% (ErbB receptors)or 10% (Akt, ERK1/2, G proteins, PARP) polyacrylamide gels asTable 1.

Proteins were then blotted onto PVDF-membranes,blocked and incubated overnight at 4uC with primary antibodiesfor phospho-specific ERK1/2 and Akt (1/2,000), ErbB receptors(1/1,000), PARP (1/1,000), G proteins (1/2,000) and b-tubulin (1/4,000) diluted in TBS/T/BSA (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0,150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA). Blots were washed,incubated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated IgG and devel-oped using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Immunoreactivebands were quantitated by video densitometry using the HerolabE.A.S.Y. RH-3 system.Determination of Protein Abundance andImmunoprecipitationThe presence of G proteins and ErbB receptors was determinedin membranes using specific antibodies as described [6]. Theformation of distinct ErbB receptor dimers was examined byimmunoprecipitation experiments according to Garrett et al. [24]in cells chronically treated with Morphine (10 mM; 5 d) or not(control). Cells of a 75 cm2flask were washed 3 times in PBS andstimulated for 10 min at 37uC with Morphine (10 mM) andHeregulin (40 ng/ml) in serum-free RPMI 1640 mediumcontaining 0.1% BSA. Cells were then placed on ice, washed 3times with PBS and cross-linked for 2 h with 5 mM DSP in PBS.Reactions were quenched with 10 mM Tris-HCl and membraneswere prepared. Protein complexes were solubilized for 1 h at 4uCin TN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl; pH 7.4)containing 1% Triton X 100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideand 4% Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics).Samples were diluted 1/10 in TN buffer, cleared by centrifugation(10,0006g; 5 min) and equal amounts of solubilisates weresubjected to immunoprecipitation overnight with anti-ErbB1antibody (dilution 1/500) and 40 ml of Protein A-agarose beads.Immuncomplexes were washed 5 times with TN buffer containing0.1% Triton X 100, cleaved by incubation for 5 min at 95uC in0.1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to gel electropho-resis.CytochemistryInduction of apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining of cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coatedcover slips using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit(Bender MedSystems) as described [5]. Cells were then fixed for30 min at RT with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS beforespecimens were mounted using VectaMountTMAQ AqueousMounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and cells were examinedby confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss) using an 636/1.4 oilimmersion objective.StatisticsAll data are expressed as the mean 6 S.E. of the number orexperiments given in the text. Statistical differences between twogroups were analyzed by Student\u0300s t test for unpaired data.Multiple comparisons were done by ANOVA followed by theTukey post-hoc test.ResultsCharacterization of Opioid Receptors in BT474 CellsTo evaluate the specificity of acute and chronic opioid effects onhuman BT474 breast cancer cells, the presence of opioid receptorswas determined first. RT-PCR experiments revealed the exclusiveexpression of m-opioid receptors in this cell line (Fig. 1a). Receptordensity was determined by equilibrium binding studies using the m-opioid receptor selective peptide agonist [3H]DAMGO as theradioligand. The results show that BT474 cells contain about7.362 fmol of m-opioid receptors per mg of membrane protein(n = 5) and that chronic Morphine treatment does not affectreceptor abundance (7.462 fmol per mg of membrane protein;n = 3). The ability of m-opioid receptors to mediate cellular effectsdepends on the presence of adequate G proteins and effectorsystems. As shown in Fig. 1b, BT474 cell membranes carry diversemembers of the family of inhibitory (Gia2, Gia3), stimulatory(Gsa), Gq (Gq/11a) and G12 (G12a, G13a, G14a) G proteins,allowing m-opioid receptors to regulate multiple intracellularsignalling pathways. Because they also express several adenylylcyclase isoforms (AC 1\u20135, 9; Fig. 1c), the functional activity of m-opioid receptors was assessed by their ability to regulateintracellular cAMP production. Indeed, acute m-opioid receptoractivation by Morphine (10 mM) significantly inhibits intracellularcAMP generation by about 53%, an effect almost completelyblocked by Naloxone (100 mM). In chronically Morphine (10 mM,5d)-treated cells an acute Morphine challenge is still able to inhibitcAMP production by about 48% (Fig. 1d). These resultsdemonstrate that BT474 cells carry fully functional endogenousm-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment does notdesensitize m-opioid receptor function providing an essentialprerequisite to induce regulatory changes on post-receptor levels.Inhibition of Cell Growth and Migration by MorphineThe growth of human BT474 breast cancer cells is driven byoverexpressed ErbB2 receptor [11]. Due to the potential capacityof m-opioid receptors to cross-regulate RTK signalling pathways[25], the ability of Morphine to interfere with BT474 cell growthwas determined. Chronic exposure of the cells to Morphineslightly attenuates basal cell growth by about 11% as determinedby crystal violet staining. However, the inhibitory opioid effect ismuch more pronounced when cells were cultured in the presenceof the ErbB3 receptor agonist Heregulin. Chronic Heregulintreatment produces mitogenic effects and increases cell number byabout 47%. Co-incubation of the cells with Morphine nowsignificantly attenuates ErbB3-driven cell growth by about 49%.Inhibition of both basal and Heregulin-stimulated cell growth byMorphine is completely blocked by the opioid receptor antagonistNaloxone (Fig. 2a). In addition, treatment of BT474 cells with theinactive stereoselective enantiomer (+)-Morphine failed to affectcell growth (not shown), excluding a receptor-independent effecton mitochondrial pH due to the alkaloid structure of Morphine.Opioids have been shown to regulate a number of differentaspects of cell growth in tumour cell lines [26]. To gain a firstindication as to whether Morphine might also interfere withHeregulin-stimulated BT474 cell migration, cell scratch assayswere performed on cells growing on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips. As shown in Fig. 2b, Heregulin (40 ng/ml) treatment for 5 dproduces morphological changes and induces cell migration intothe gap 24 h after scratching. Co-incubation of the cells withMorphine (10 mM, 5d) prevents cell differentiation and migrationinto the open field, an effect that was partially blocked in thepresence of Naloxone (100 mM). These results indicate thatchronic Morphine treatment interferes with cell migration bypreventing cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions.Regulation of Cell Proliferation by MorphineInhibition of BT474 cell growth by chronic Morphine treatmentmay be due to attenuation of cell proliferation and/or inhibition ofcell survival. To discriminate between these two possibilities, theeffect of acute and chronic Morphine treatment on ERK1/2stimulation was determined. Most interestingly, acute m-opioidreceptor activation produces discrepant effects on ERK1/2Morphine Regulation of ErbB SignallingPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510phosphorylation, depending on whether basal or Heregulin-stimulated activities were measured in control or chronicallyMorphine exposed cells. In control cells, acute m-opioid receptoractivation using a maximum effective concentration of Morphine(10 mM; determined in preliminary experiments) results inelevation of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but significantlyattenuates Heregulin (ErbB3)-induced ERK1/2 activation byabout 17%. Chronic Morphine treatment (10 mM, 5d) results inelevation of basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphor-ylation. Under these conditions, acute m-opioid receptor activationnow significantly enhances ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activity byabout 14% (Fig. 3a). The increase in basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 activity by chronic Morphine treatment isalso given in Fig. 3b.Similar results were observed when cell proliferation wasexamined by determination of DNA synthesis for 2 h using theBrdU assay. Again, acute m-opioid receptor activation in controlcells significantly stimulates basal and inhibits Heregulin-stimulat-ed cell proliferation by about 16% and 10%, respectively. ChronicMorphine treatment completely abolishes the ability of acute m-opioid receptor activation to stimulate basal cell proliferation andattenuates the overall effect of Heregulin by about 16%. In thesecells, acute m-opioid receptor activation now significantly enhancesErbB3-stimulated cell proliferation by nearly 10% (Fig. 3c). Theseresults demonstrate that Morphine is able to regulate mitogenicsignalling in human BT474 breast cancer cells and that the kind ofacute m-opioid receptor effect produced largely depends on theactivation state of the cell. In addition, they also indicate thatchronic Morphine treatment alters the ErbB receptor systemcontrolling the growth of BT474 cells.Morphine Regulation of Akt SignallingThe finding that chronic Morphine treatment attenuates basaland Heregulin-stimulated cell growth in the presence of anenhanced mitogenic m-opioid receptor activity suggests thatadditional mechanisms must exist that shortens the lifespan ofthe cells. Therefore, we investigated whether chronic Morphinetreatment would possibly attenuate cell survival by inhibition ofAkt phosphorylation. As shown in !Fig. 4a, BT474 cells displaybasal levels of Akt phosphorylation, which are stimulated afteractivation of ErbB3 receptors by Heregulin. Chronic morphinetreatment results in elevation of both basal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt activities. Acute m-opioid receptor activation fails toaffect basal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling in bothcontrol and chronically Morphine-treated cells. The increase inbasal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt activity after chronic Mor-Figure 1. Characterization of m-opioid receptors in BT474 cells. (A) Detection of m-opioid receptors by RT-PCR.

Theseresults demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment increasesbasal and Heregulin-stimulated cell survival despite the overallattenuation of cell growth.Induction of Apoptosis by Chronic MorphineTo explain this apparent discrepancy, we examined theinduction of apoptosis by chronic Morphine treatment by twodifferent experimental approaches. We first compared the effect ofMorphine on stress-induced apoptosis in control and chronicallymorphine treated BT474 cells by means of PARP cleavage. Incontrol cells, serum starvation for 6 h failed to induce PARPcleavage. Apoptosis was induced only in the presence of Heregulinduring the starvation period. Co-incubation of the cells togetherwith Morphine had no further effect on PARP cleavage.Completely different results were obtained in chronically Mor-phine-treated cells. Here, serum starvation alone was alreadysufficient to induce PARP cleavage. The induction of apoptosiswas further enhanced by the addition of Heregulin and Morphine,with their individual effects being additive (Fig. 4c). Similar resultswere obtained when apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining of the cells. Cultivation of BT474 cellson cover slips for 5 d in complete growth medium resulted inadherent patches that are negative for Annexin V-FITC staining.Addition of Morphine (10 mM) during the incubation periodresulted in cell rounding, strong Annexin V binding and nuclearpropidium iodide incorporation, which is indicative for theinduction of apoptosis. As observed in the cell migration assay,chronic Heregulin treatment (40 ng/ml) produced morphologicalchanges towards a more differentiated cell shape and induced ofearly steps of apoptosis as demonstrated by acquiring a polygonalcell shape and bright Annexin V-FITC staining. Concomitanttreatment with Morphine prevented cell differentiation andinduced apoptosis as indicated by cell rounding and nuclearpropidium iodide incorporation. This chronic Morphine effectagain is completely blocked by Naloxone (Fig. 4d). Together, theseresults demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474cells induces apoptosis and enhances Heregulin-stimulated cellfate.Figure 2.

To obtain a first indication forwhether changes in the ErbB receptor network would account forthe differences observed in mitogenic m-opioid receptor signallingafter chronic Morphine treatment, several components of receptortyrosine kinase-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathwayswere analysed by the use of established protein kinase inhibitors.ErbB2-overexpressing BT474 cells contain physiologic levels ofErbB3 receptors that are essential for ErbB2-driven cell growth[27]. To our surprise, inhibition of catalytic ErbB1 function by thetyrphostin analogue AG 1478 completely blocked all aspects ofbasal, Morphine- and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Aktphosphorylation in both control and chronically morphine treatedcells, indicating that ErbB1 must represent the obligatory bindingpartner in all ErbB receptor dimers.

In contrast,AG825 exclusively attenuated Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2activation in chronically Morphine-treated cells. Because AG825also fails to affect Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling, the ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimer appears to mediate ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling in Morphine-treated cells. Pre-incubation of the cellswith the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin completely blocks Aktphosphorylation under all conditions. In control cells, Wortman-nin has no effect on basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2phosphorylation. However, it largely attenuates ErbB3-stimulatedERK1/2 activation in chronic Morphine-treated cells. This resultimplies that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474 cells switchesHeregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling from a PI3K-indepen-dent to a PI3K-dependent mechanism. The contribution ofmetalloproteinases on chronic Morphine-induced mitogenic sig-nalling was finally evaluated by pre-incubation of the cells withEGCG. To our surprise, blockade of ectodomain shedding byEGCG selectively attenuates basal and Heregulin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in chronically Morphine-treated, but not incontrol cells. In addition, overall levels of Akt phosphorylationappear to be reduced as compared to controls. This findingindicates that activation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers inchronically Morphine-treated cells appears to require the releaseof an autocrine factor (Fig. 5a). Further studies revealed that theIGF-1 receptor fails to contribute to chronic Morphine-inducedchanges in ERK1/2 and Akt signalling (not shown).To verify whether ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers contribute tomitogenic signalling in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells,these were pre-treated with AG825 and subsequently stimulatedwith EGF. In both control and chronically Morphine-treated cells,activation of ErbB1 by EGF leads to stimulation of ERK1/2 andAkt activities, as previously observed for Heregulin. Again,functional inactivation of ErbB2 by AG825 selectively attenuatesEGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Morphine-treatedcells (Fig. 5b). Thus, EGF appears to induce the formation ofErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers only after chronic Morphine treat-ment of the cells.One major mechanism by which the formation of ErbBreceptor dimers may be modulated is by regulation of receptorquantity. As shown in Fig. 5c, chronic Morphine treatmentdifferentially regulates the relative abundance of ErbB receptortypes present. By means of Western blot analysis of BT474 plasmamembranes, strong immunoreactive bands were obtained forErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors. The ErbB4 receptor signalwas only barely detectable. Chronic Morphine treatment producescomplex changes in ErbB receptor levels. It increases the relativeabundance of ErbB1 and ErbB3 and strongly down-regulates theamount of ErbB2. The levels of ErbB4 remained unchanged.Concomitant treatment of the cells with Naloxone at least partlyprevented these changes. These results suggest that chronicMorphine treatment could possibly alter the formation ofindividual ErbB homo- and heterodimers by regulating ErbBreceptor abundance.To test whether chronic Morphine indeed leads to therearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers, co-precipitation studiesusing an anti-ErbB1 antibody were performed. In membranesfrom control cells, ErbB1 appears to exclusively form heterodimerswith ErbB3. Short-term stimulation of the cells with Heregulindoes not affect ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, but leads to co-precipitation of traces of ErbB2. Besides ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodi-mers, chronic Morphine treatment also results in the formation ofErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers. Again, short-term stimulation of thecells with Heregulin did not affect dimer formation (Fig. 5d).Together, these results demonstrate that chronic Morphinetreatment alters ERK1/2 and Akt signalling in BT474 cells bythe establishment of newly formed ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers.To investigate whether similar alterations are also induced inother ErbB-driven breast tumour cells, the effect on chronicMorphine treatment on mitogenic signalling was examined inSKBR3 human mammary carcinoma cells. These cells carry highlevels of ErbB2 and physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3 [16].RT-PCR experiments verified the expression of k-type opioidreceptors in this cells system (Fig. 6a), providing the basis for thedevelopment of chronic Morphine-induced adaptations at thelevel of the ErbB network. Although chronic Morphine (10 mM,3d) treatment produced a subtle increase in the abundance ofErbB1 in plasma membranes (Fig. 6b), no major effect on cellgrowth was found as assessed by crystal violet staining (100 vs.103.866%, mean 6 SE, n = 5). Nonetheless, the use of proteinkinase inhibitors revealed the induction of profound alterations inErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling by chronic Morphinetreatment. As shown in Fig. 6c, EGF (100 ng/ml) and Heregulin(40 ng/ml) both stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation to about thesame extent in control and chronically Morphine (10 mM, 3d)-treated cells. In both cells, pre-treatment with the ErbB1 inhibitorAG1478 not only attenuates ErbB1-, but also ErbB3-stimulatedERK1/2 activation. This indicates that Heregulin-stimulatedERK1/2 signalling requires ErbB1 in both control and chronicallyMorphine-treated SKBR3 cells. In contrast, pre-incubation of thecells with AG825, Wortmannin and EGCG specifically attenuatedErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in chronically Morphine-treated, but not in control cells. Thus, chronic Morphinetreatment of SKBR3 cells switches Heregulin-mediated ERK1/2signalling to a PI3K-, matrix metalloproteinase- and ErbB2-dependent mechanism comparable to that observed in BT474cells. These results demonstrate that in tumour cells thedysregulated ErbB receptor system represents a target for chronicopioid treatment.DiscussionThere is increasing evidence that opioid analgesics interferewith several aspects of tumour growth [3]. Here we describe thathuman BT474 breast cancer cells endogenously express function-ally active m-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphinetreatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptornetwork resulting in attenuation of Heregulin-stimulated cellgrowth. These data add a new dimension on the mechanism ofopioid-stimulated mitogenic signalling, as they demonstrate thatopioid receptors not only transactivate RTK-associated signallingpathways but also may alter the growth characteristics of tumourcells by rearrangement of the ErbB receptor system.The ErbB receptor family integrates a number of auto- andparacrine signals to regulate normal cell growth, differentiation(100 mM) as indicated. Samples were analysed by Western blot using an antibody recognizing full length (116 kDa) and cleaved (89 kDa) PARP. Thesame samples were blotted for b-tubulin (loading control).

In many cancers, the ErbB receptornetwork is hyperactive and leads to clonal expansion of tumourcells [29]. Among the best studied examples are human breastcancers that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor. Because the level ofErbB2 gene amplification in ErbB2 positive cancers is muchhigher than in normal tissue, targeted inactivation of the ErbB2protein evolved as one to the most promising and successfulantineoplastic strategies in these cancers. The outcome of anti-ErbB2 treatments, however, is often limited by the induction ofcompensatory resistance mechanisms due to the high plasticity ofthe ErbB network [17]. In this context, the present studyperformed on human BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cellsopens a new perspective in order to enhance the sensitivity ofErbB2-directed treatments and to avoid escape mechanisms. Thisidea bases on the finding that chronic Morphine treatment inducesapoptosis in BT474 cells by affecting the specificity of Heregulin-stimulated ErbB signalling. These effects are mediated by theformation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers in chronically Morphinetreated cells that switch tumour cell growth from an ErbB3- to andErbB2-dependent mechanism. Opposite changes in ErbB receptorplasticity have been previously reported for BT474 and SKBR3mamma carcinoma cells chronically treated with specific anti-ErbB1 and ErbB2 inhibitors. In these studies, inactivation ErbB1and ErbB2 receptors restored cell growth by reactivation of ErbB3and ErbB4 receptor signalling [30] and redirected tumour cellgrowth from an ERK1/2 to an Akt-dependent mechanism [24].The changes in ErbB receptor network by chronic Morphinetreatment were detected by the use of protein kinase inhibitors toblock acute m-opioid receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 and Aktactivity. Although the single use of protein kinase inhibitors maybe endowed with several drawbacks, like non-specific effects, it wasnot possible to verify the present results by genetic approachesbecause siRNA-mediated knock-down or protein overexpressionper se may alter ErbB signalling and mask possible chronicMorphine effects. Nevertheless, the use of validated and generallyaccepted protein kinase inhibitors in this study provided novelinsight into the composition of ErbB receptor dimers in BT474and SKBR3 cells. Our experiments suggest that ErbB1 appears torepresent the obligatory binding partner in ErbB receptor dimers,because pre-treatment of the cells with AG1478 blocked all aspectsof basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt activities. Toour surprise, ERK1/2 signalling was exclusively affected byAG825 in chronically Morphine treated, but not in control cells.This suggests that chronic Morphine treatment induces theformation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, which was verified byour co-immunoprecipitation studies in BT474 cells. Co-immuno-precipitation also revealed the existence of ErbB1/ErbB3 hetero-dimers in both na\u0131\u0308ve and chronically Morphine-treated cells,substantiating the notion that the growth of BT474 cells isdependent on ErB3 signalling despite overexpression of ErbB2[27].To investigate the role of chronic Morphine treatment onErbB3 signalling, Heregulin stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signal-ling was investigated in BT474 and SKBR3 cells. In control cells,Heregulin appears to mediate ERK1/2 and Akt signalling viaactivation of single ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. Activation ofErbB3 in ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers has been shown to mediatesignal transduction by transactivation of ErbB1, which in turnstimulates the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 cascade by binding the adapterproteins Shc and Grb2 [31]. Because ErbB3 is deficient of kinaseactivity, Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling must be accomplishedby Grb2/Gab1 mediated cross-regulation of PI3K [32]. After theintroduction of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, Heregulin-stimulatedERK1/2, but not Akt signalling became dependent on ErbB2receptors in BT474 cells. This finding suggests that Akt signallingis further accomplished by ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, whereaswere stimulated for 5 min with or without Heregulin (40 ng/ml) to form receptor dimers. Proteins were cross-linked and ErbB1 containing dimerswere immunoprecipitated using an anti-ErbB1 antibody. Individual ErbB receptors were determined in whole cell solubilisates (S) andimmunoprecipitates (IP) by Western blot using type-specific antibodies. Equal protein load was verified by determination of IgG heavy chains (Fc).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g005Figure 6. Regulation of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine inSKBR3 cells.

Controls were kept in the absence of protein inhibitors (none).Total ERK1/2 was determined using an overall reactive antibody.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g006Morphine Regulation of ErbB SignallingPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510ERK1/2 signalling is redirected to ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers.Such a mechanism would require the autocrine release of an EGF-like ligand by Heregulin, which then transactivates the ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimer. In our experiments, blockade of metallopro-teinase activity by EGCG largely attenuated Heregulin- and EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that Heregulin indeedinduces the release of an EGF-like ligand. Reactivation of acomparable autocrine loop maintaining ErbB2 activity has beenpreviously described for breast cancer cells chronically treated withan anti-ErbB2 directed antibody [!33]. In chronically Morphinetreated cells, Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling alsobecame dependent on PI3K, whereas pre-treatment withWortmannin is ineffective in control cells. To date, cross-activationof ERK1/2 signalling by PI3K has been observed only underdistinct conditions, however the underlying cellular mechanismremain unclear. It has been suggested that PI3K-dependent Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signalling is that ErbB1 recruits GAP/SH2complexes to cell membranes by PIP3 in the presence of lowdoses of EGF-like ligands [34]. Although we cannot exclude such amechanism, our results suggest that PI3K contributes to theHeregulin-induced cleavage of EGF-like ligands by metalloprotei-nase. This would be in line with the finding that PI3K is able toblock a negative feedback loop in ErbB3-driven tumour cells,resulting in a compensatory activation of the ERK signallingpathway [35]. The question remains how Heregulin brings aboutAkt phosphorylation in chronically Morphine treated BT474 cells.Despite the lack of catalytic activity, ErbB3 is able to directlyactivate PI3K by binding all three regulatory subunits throughtheir SH-domains [13]. However, phosphorylation of the 6consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of ErbB3 isonly induced after ligand-induced activation of an ErbB bindingpartner. In this respect, an EGF-like ligand released by Heregulinmight activate accomplish direct Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3heterodimers in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells. Such amechanism appears plausible because blockade of metalloprotei-nase activity in chronically Morphine-treated cells substantiallyattenuates the levels of Akt phosphorylation. A model of chronicMorphine-induced changes in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 andAkt signalling is shown in !Fig. 7.In BT474 cells, the functional consequence of the chronicMorphine-induced alterations in ErbB signalling is the enhance-ment of Heregulin-induced apoptosis. Morphine is known topossess pro-apoptotic effects in a number or cell models. Pathwaysproposed to be involved in Morphine-induced apoptosis includean increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bim, decreased expres-sion of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [36] and stabilization of p53 [37]. Onthe other hand opioids have also been shown to display stronganti-apoptotic properties in a number of cell models, which aremediated by activation of the Akt pathway [5]. On the first view,the induction of apoptosis in BT474 cells is somewhat surprising,since chronic Morphine treatment consistently increased basallevels of Akt phosphorylation. One possible explanation for thisapparent discrepancy is that the switch from an ErbB3- to anErbB2-dependent signalling attenuates cell survival by maskingErbB3 driven Akt signalling. An opposite mechanism has beendescribed in cancer cells with dominant PI3K signalling in which anegative feedback loop dampens compensatory Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 activity, maintaining anti-apoptotic signalling [35]. In thisrespect, chronic Morphine-induced ErbB2 signalling may beviewed as an escape mechanism that blocks Akt signalling.The mechanism by which chronic Morphine regulates therearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers remains to be determined.One possible explanation would be that Morphine, which acts as apartial agonist at the m-opioid receptor, produces persistentinhibitory opioid signalling due to its failure to desensitize thereceptor [38]. Indeed, although present at relatively low levels inBT474, chronic Morphine treatment had no effect on m-opioidreceptor abundance and signalling, providing an absoluterequirement for the induction of adaptational changes on post-receptor level. In neuronal cells, such changes are proposed tocontribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence[1]. In non-neuronal cells, chronic Morphine treatment has beenshown to facilitate persistent ERK1/2 signalling by down-regulation of c-Cbl and blockade of ErbB1 receptor degradation[18]. Inhibition of protein degradation could explain our findingthat chronic Morphine treatment elevates the abundance of ErbB1and ErbB3 in BT474 cells. An opposite down-regulation of ErbB2after chronic Morphine treatment might be the result ofactivation-induced cleavage of the receptor, which is typical forErbB2-overexpressing cells [39]. Because regulation of ErbBabundance is a critical determinant for the signalling activity in aFigure 7. Model of chronic Morphine-induced changes in ErbBsignalling. The scheme depicts the differences in Heregulin-stimulatedErbB signalling in control and chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells.In control cells, stimulation with Heregulin leads to activation of ERK1/2and Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. While AG1478 blocksboth Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling, inhibition of PI3Kby Wortmannin specifically prevents Akt signalling. Because ErbB3phosphorylation and PI3K activation is dependent on the presence of adimerized ErbB member with catalytic activity, these results indicatethat Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is predominantly mediatedthrough ErbB1. The failure of Wortmannin to affect ERK1/2 activation incontrol cells further implicates that Heregulin stimulates Akt signallingvia ErbB3. Chronic Morphine treatment alters mitogenic signalling byrearrangement of ErbB heterodimers. Whereas Heregulin still stimulatesAkt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3, ERK1/2 signalling is now accomplishedby ErbB1/2 heterodimers. These are activated indirectly by an EGF-likeligand liberated from Heregulin in a PI3K (Wortmannin)- andmetalloproteinase (EGCG)-dependent manner.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g007Morphine Regulation of ErbB SignallingPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510given cell system [28], quantitative changes in ErbB receptorsrepresent a potential mechanism by which chronic Morphinetreatment influences the composition of individual ErbB dimers.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that chronic Morphinetreatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptornetwork of human breast cancer cells that are characterized byquantitative alterations in the abundance of individual ErbBreceptors, alterations in ErbB dimer formation and the introduc-tion of an autocrine loop that redirects Heregulin-stimulatedERK1/2 activation from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/2-heterodi-mers. Although these changes produce no major effect onMorphine stimulated cell growth and mitogenic signalling, theybecome evident when Heregulin-stimulated effects on cell growthwere examined. Direct modulation of ErbB signalling mechanismscould explain the many discrepant opioid effects on cell growthand apoptosis observed so far in individual cell systems and mayprovide a novel strategy to stabilize certain ErbB dimers in orderto enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directed anti-tumour therapiesand to avoid the development of drug resistance by preventingescape mechanisms.AcknowledgmentsWe like to thank Andreas Blaschke for help with confocal microscopy.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: IRW HA.
