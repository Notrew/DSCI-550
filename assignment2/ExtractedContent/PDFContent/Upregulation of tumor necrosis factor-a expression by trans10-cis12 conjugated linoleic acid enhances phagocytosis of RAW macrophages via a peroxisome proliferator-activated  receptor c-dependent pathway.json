Phagocytic activity of naive RAW macro-phages was increased either by recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-a or by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW macro-phages. This phagocytic activity was inhibited by addition of anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb). 10t\u201312c CLA also increasedthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW macrophages. When naive RAW macrophages were incubated with the culture super-natant from RAW macrophages treated with 10t\u201312c CLA plus GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist, their phagocytic activity was signifi-cantly inhibited. In addition, GW 9662 antagonized the effect of 10t\u201312c CLA in stimulating TNF-a expression. These results suggestthat 10t\u201312c CLA modulates the phagocytic activity of RAW macrophages by upregulating TNF-a expression via a PPARc-dependentpathway.\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionThe peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong tothe nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and form hetero-dimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXR) [1,2]. To date,three isotypes of PPARs, a, b, and c, have been identifiedin a number of species. PPARc was initially characterized1043-4666/$ - see front matter \ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yang).as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipidmetabolism and is found in various cell types [3,4].PPARc is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs), the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabeticdrugs, a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,and endogenous ligands such as 15-deoxy-D12,14-PGJ2(15d-PGJ2) [5,6]. 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, PPARcagonists, inhibit phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)-inducedproduction of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necro-sis factor (TNF)-a in peripheral blood monocytes [7].However, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, also PPARcagonists, did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced TNF-amailto:mpyang@chungbuk.ac.kr228 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235release from human monocytic THP-1 cells [8]. This PPARcmay regulate inflammatory and immune responses bymodulating the activity of monocytes or macrophages.Dietary fatty acids such as linoleic acid and arachidonicacid may act as PPARc ligands to modulate lipid metabo-lism and suppress carcinogenesis, cytokine production,acute inflammation, and lymphocyte proliferation [9\u201311].Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positionaland geometric isomers of linoleic acid with conjugateddouble bonds ranging from 6,8 to 12,14 [12,13]. CLAhas shown a wide range of biologically beneficial effectssuch as anti-adipogenic activity, including reduction ofbody fat and lowering cholesterol level, and anti-diabeto-genic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-atherosclerotic activity[14\u201316]. CLA can stimulate or inhibit immune cell func-tions. CLA increased TNF-a and IL-6 secretion anddecreased IL-4 secretion by splenocytes [17] and reducedIL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages [18].CLA modulates expression of genes regulated by PPARcin muscle and activates PPARc in vitro [19]. In addition,expression of PPARc is enhanced in CLA-fed pigs [20].In contrast, CLA down-regulates expression of PPARc,as well as its target genes, fatty acid binding protein andliver X receptor a in adipocytes [13]. Murine alveolar mac-rophages, which express high levels of PPARc, suppressoxidative burst activity in response to PMA, expressionof inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response tolipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-c, and production ofIL-12 mRNA and protein in response to LPS [21]. Thesereports indicate that the effects of CLA in modulatingimmune responses are similar to effects induced by ligandsof PPARc.Two CLA isomers, the cis9\u2013trans11 (9c\u201311t) CLA andtrans10\u2013cis12 (10t\u201312c) CLA are known to stimulate theimmune system [22]. The previous studies [23,24] revealedthat 10t\u201312c CLA has directly no effects on phagocytosisof peripheral blood phagocytes and on chemotaxis of poly-morphonuclear cells (PMN). However, 10t\u201312c CLA wasshown to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) to secrete soluble factor(s) that increased the che-motactic and phagocytic activity of PMN, which may be animportant mechanism to enhance the innate immuneresponse. The phagocytic activity of PMN was demon-strated to mediate through TNF-a produced by PBMCstimulated with egg white derivatives, one of immunostim-ulants [25].We examined whether TNF-a expression in the phago-cytic activity of RAW macrophages by 10t\u201312c CLA isassociated with PPARc activation.2. Materials and methods2.1. RAW macrophagesThe BALB/c mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7was purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,Korea) and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019smedium (Gibco Co., Grand Island, NY, USA) with4.5 mg/ml L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-vated fetal calf serum (Gibco Co.) and 100 lg/ml strepto-mycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.2.2. Reagents10t\u201312c CLA (98% purity; Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap,PA, USA) was purchased commercially. 10t\u201312c CLAstock solution was prepared by dissolving 10t\u201312c CLAin dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to final 50 mM and passedthrough a 0.45 lm-membrane filter (Milipore Co., Bed-ford, MA, USA) before use. Recombinant mouse (rm)TNF-a, goat anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb),rabbit anti-goat IgG alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate,GW 9662 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), rmP-PARc, rabbit anti-PPARc pAb, goat anti-rabbit IgGhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santacruz Bio-technology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and goat anti-recombinant human (rh) IL-2 pAb (R&D Systems Inc.,Minneapolis, MN, USA) were also purchasedcommercially.2.3. Culture supernatant10t\u201312c CLA and/or GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist,were added to RAW 264.7 cells culture media with a min-imal volume (<0.1%) of DMSO as the solvent and the sameamount as vehicle DMSO was added to control cells with-out 10t\u201312c CLA treatment. The RAW 264.7 cells at a den-sity of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (NuncCo., Naperville, IL, USA) were incubated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA, in the presence or absence of 0.01\u20131 lM GW9662 at 37 \ufffdC in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Aftera 24 h-incubation, all culture supernatants were collectedafter centrifugation at 5000g for 30 min, filtered througha 0.45 lm-pore size membrane filter and stored at \ufffd70 \ufffdCuntil used. The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was consis-tently more than 90% at the time of culture supernatantcollection, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.2.4. Protein extraction and Western blotThe cultured RAW 264.7 cells were lysed in ice-coldPRO-PREP\ufffd (iNtRon Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea)protein extraction solution, according to the manufac-turer\u2019s protocol. Protein concentrations of RAW 264.7cells lysate and culture supernatant were determined usingthe Bradford assay [26]. Electrophoresis of protein lysateswas performed using a 12% polyacrylamide separatinggel (5% stacking gel) in a Tris\u2013glycine buffer system underdenaturing conditions. All samples were mixed with anequal volume of sample buffer, boiled, and loaded ontothe gel. Proteins were transferred (Trans-Blot\ufffd Cell;Bio-Rad Lab., Hercules, CA, USA) onto 0.2 lm-nitrocel-lulose membranes (Sartorius AG., Gottingen, Germany)at 300 mA for 3 h. Non-specific binding sites were blockedD.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235 229for 3 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buf-fered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST),and washed briefly three times with TBST. Membraneswere subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperaturein 0.5% BSA\u2013TBST containing either a rabbit antipeptidepAb raised against a synthetic PPARc peptide synthesizedusing the mouse PPARc sequence, or goat anti-rmTNF-apAb. After washing three times with TBST, the membraneswere incubated with either anti-rabbit IgG conjugated withHRP or anti-goat IgG conjugated with AP in 0.5% BSA/TBST for 2 h. The membranes were washed twice withTBST and once with TBS. The membranes with HRP con-jugated antibody were incubated in chemiluminescent sub-strate and exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak,Rochester, NY, USA). The membranes with AP conju-gated antibody were incubated with nitro blue tetrazoliumchloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Ger-many) in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 0.1 MTris\u2013HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 M NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Thereaction was stopped by rinsing membranes with 20 mMEDTA in TBS.2.5. Phagocytic activity analysesOne hundred microliter of RAW 264.7 cells, adjustedto 5 \u00b7 106 cells/ml, was added to each well of a 24-wellplate. The RAW 264.7 cells were incubated withrmTNF-a and culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with either 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLAalone or in combination with 0.01\u20131 lM GW 9662 for12 h at 37 \ufffdC under a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.For neutralization test, various concentrations of anti-rmTNF-a pAb were mixed with 10t\u201312c CLA-stimulatedRAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Goat anti-rhIL-2pAb was used as a control isotype IgG. The samples weremixed and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Tenmicroliter of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-latexbeads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml, latex bead size, 2.0 lm; Poly-sciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) were added to eachwell for the final 2 h. RAW 264.7 cells incubated withoutFITC-latex beads were used as a negative control. Thecultured cells were harvested gently by slow pipetting,centrifuged at 400g for 3 min and washed three times withPBS containing 3 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid(EDTA). The supernatant was discarded and replacedwith 1 ml PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde to stabi-lize the cells. Phagocytic activity was measured by flowcytometry (BRYTE HS, Bio-Rad, Microscience Ltd.,England) and surface-adherent FITC fluorescence onRAW 264.7 cells was quenched by addition of 20 ll ofa 0.4% trypan blue solution to each tube before flowcytometry analysis. FITC fluorescence was measuredbetween 520 and 560 nm on 5000 RAW 264.7 cells persample. The cells were gated by forward and side lightscatter characteristics. The results were expressed as per-centages of absolute phagocytic activities.2.6. RNA isolationTotal RNA was prepared from RAW 264.7 cells usingthe TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA).RAW 264.7 cells were mixed with 1 ml TRIzol reagent.Chloroform (200 ll per 1 ml TRIzol reagent) was addedand the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. Thelysate was centrifuged for phase separation at 13,000g for10 min. After separation, the aqueous phase was trans-ferred to a fresh tube, 500 ll of isopropyl alcohol wasadded and the tube gently inverted to mix. The sampleswere centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was removedand the visible pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol.The RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate(DEPC)-treated water, and the concentration of RNAwas determined by absorbance at 260 nm.2.7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysisTotal RNA (2 lg) was reverse transcribed into firststrand complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and a random primer(9 mer). To determine the conditions under which PCRamplification of PPARc, TNF-a, and cytochrome coxidase subunit I(1A) mRNA are in the logarithmic phase,1 ll samples were amplified using different numbers ofcycles. The 1A gene was PCR amplified to control forRNA degradation and variation in mRNA concentrationsin the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. PCR productsand amplification cycles were linearly related in PPARc,TNF-a, and 1A mRNAs. Thirty cycles of PCR for PPARcand TNF-a and 25 cycles for 1A were used for quantifica-tion. The cDNA was amplified in a 20 ll PCR reactioncontaining 1 unit Taq polymerase in PCR buffer (PromegaCo., Madison, WI, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTP,and 50 pmol of specific primers. PCR reactions were dena-tured at 95 \ufffdC for 1 min, annealed at 50 \ufffdC for 1 min, andextended at 72 \ufffdC for 1.5 min. The cDNA sequences for thedetection of transcripts of PPARc, TNF-a and 1A wereobtained by RT using the following primers (MacrogenInc., Seoul, Korea). The PPARc primers were based onthe deposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.NM011146): 5 0-GAA AAG ACC CAG CTC TAC AAC-3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTT CAG CTG GTC GAT ATCAC-3 0 (reverse). The TNF-a primers were based on thedeposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.NM013693): 5 0-CCT CCC TCT CAT CAG TTC TAT-3 0(forward) and 5 0-GAG GTT GAC TTT CTC CTC CTGGT-3 0 (reverse). The 1A gene primers (GenBank AccessionNo. J01420) were: 5 0-CAC CGT AGG AGG TCT AAC G-3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTA TCG TCG AGG TAT TCC G-3 0(reverse). PCR products (10 ll) were electrophoresed on a2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.Photographs of the gels were scanned and analyzed using230 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235a digital analysis program (Gel Doc 1000, version 1.5,Bio-Rad Lab.).2.8. Data analysesThe one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019stest for each pair for multiple comparisons was used inorder to determine statistical significance. Comparisonsof two groups at each GW 9662 concentration were madeby Student\u2018s t-test. All data expressed as mean \u00b1 standarderror of the mean (SEM).3. Results3.1.

RAW 264.7cell cultures were incubated with these samples for 30 min. All cultures were supplemented with 10 ll of FITC-latex beads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml) for the final2 h. The phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was measured using flow cytometry. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3, **P < 0.01, comparedto control (in panel A), vehicle-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant (in panel B) and 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW264.7 cell culture supernatant(12.5%) (in panel C).D.-H.

The phag-ocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was also significantlyincreased (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner by addi-tion of 0.01\u201310 ng/ml rmTNF-a compared to the responseto culture supernatant (12.5%) of RAW 264.7 cells treatedwith vehicle (DMSO) instead of 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h andwas highest at 1 ng/ml rmTNF-a (Fig. 2B). The effect ofanti-rmTNF-a pAb on the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells in response to the culture supernatant fromRAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA was examined.The enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells toculture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for24 h was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent mannerby addition of 0.001\u20131 lg/ml anti-rmTNF-a pAb, whencompared to the activity induced by the 10t\u201312c CLA-trea-ted culture supernatant alone (Fig. 2C). In contrast, theenhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells inresponse to culture supernatant treated with 10t\u201312cCLA was not inhibited by addition of anti-rhIL-2 pAb(1 lg/ml: control IgG) instead of anti-rmTNF-a pAb.Fig. 3.

High concentrations of thePPARc ligands troglitazone (30 lM) and 15d-PGJ2(10 lM) inhibited the expression of TNF-a as well asdecreased the cell viability in vitro [28]. In contrast,10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA, used in this study, up-regulatedTNF-a expression and maintained a high RAW 264.7 cellviability of greater than 90%. The phagocytic activity ofRAW 264.7 cells was enhanced by either culture superna-tant from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA orrmTNF-a. In addition, anti-rmTNF-a pAb neutralizedthe enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stim-ulated by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA treatedRAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that 10t\u201312cCLA stimulates RAW 264.7 cells to produce TNF-a, whichenhances the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells.TNF-a is a natural stimulant which promotes the phag-ocytic activity of phagocytes [29]. It has beeen reported thatthe enhanced phagocytic activity of PMN by culture super-natant from PBMC treated with immunostimulating eggwhite derivatives, was due to TNF-a, but not IL-1 [25].Rats fed a diet containing 10t\u201312c CLA have the enhancedphagocytic activity of phagocytes, correlated with anincrease in plasma TNF-a [30]. The CLA stimulated tumorcell killing ability of macrophages has been associated withinduction of TNF-a expression [31]. It has been alsoreported that CLA decreases the synthesis of prostaglandinE2 (PGE2) [32], and PGE2 has been shown to haveprofound down-regulatory effects on various inflammatorycells [33]. PGE2 has been reported to regulate macrophageTNF-a production through negative feedback [34]. There-fore, one possible explanation for increased TNF-aexpression in porcine PBMC treated with t10c12-CLAmay be related to decreased PGE2 regulation of TNF-a.The results demonstrated that 10t-12c CLA increasedthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW 264.7cells. This finding is consistent with reports that the expres-sion of PPARc was increased in CLA-fed pigs [20] andthat the supplementation of CLA in the diet enhancedthe colonic expression of PPARc [35]. Since CLA under-goes elongation and desaturation processes similar to thoseof polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleicacid, D6 desaturase metabolites of CLA can also activatePPARc expression [12]. Thus, the induction of PPARcexpression may occur through direct binding of CLA aswell as active metabolites of CLA [36]. These resultssuggest that CLA acts as a ligand of PPARc and activatesPPARc.The present study indicates that 10t\u201312c CLA stimulatesboth PPARc and TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells.We used a specific and high affinity PPARc antagonist(nanomolar IC50, [37]), GW 9662, to elucidate the role ofPPARc on TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells inducedby 10t\u201312c CLA. GW 9662 antagonized the effect of10t\u201312c CLA on TNF-a expression of RAW 264.7 cellsas well as their phagocytic activity induced by TNF-a.These results suggest that the effects of 10t\u201312c-CLA onTNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells may be dependenton the PPARc pathway. High affinity PPARc ligands suchas the thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic agent AD-5075and the non-TZD insulin-sensitizing agent L-796,499 didnot inhibit production of TNF-a and IL-6 in RAW 264.7cells [38].In conclusion, the overall results of this study show thatthe effect of 10t\u201312c CLA on the phagocytic activity ofRAW 264.7 macrophages might be mediated by TNF-aexpression via a PPARc-dependent pathway.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Livestock Re-search Institute and the ministry of Education and HumanResources Development (MOE), the Ministry of Com-merce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) and the Ministryof Labor (MOLAB) through the fostering project of thelab of Excellency.
