Increasing evidenceindicates the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are involved in the regulation of microglia function, prompting us tohypothesize Kv channels may also be involved in microglia-mediated neurotoxic activity in HIV-1-infected brain. To test thishypothesis, we investigated the involvement of Kv channels in the response of microglia to HIV-1 Tat protein. Treatment ofrat microglia with HIV-1 Tat protein (200 ng/ml) resulted in pro-inflammatory microglial activation, as indicated by increasesin TNF-a, IL-1b, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide, which were accompanied by enhanced outward K+ current andKv1.3 channel expression. Suppression of microglial Kv1.3 channel activity, either with Kv1.3 channel blockers Margatoxin, 5-(4-Phenoxybutoxy)psoralen, or broad-spectrum K+channel blocker 4-Aminopyridine, or by knockdown of Kv1.3 expressionvia transfection of microglia with Kv1.3 siRNA, was found to abrogate the neurotoxic activity of microglia resulting from HIV-1 Tat exposure. Furthermore, HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal apoptosis was attenuated with the application of supernatantcollected from K+channel blocker-treated microglia. Lastly, the intracellular signaling pathways associated with Kv1.3 wereinvestigated and enhancement of microglial Kv1.3 was found to correspond with an increase in Erk1/2 mitogen-activatedprotein kinase activation. These data suggest targeting microglial Kv1.3 channels may be a potential new avenue of therapyfor inflammation-mediated neurological disorders.Citation: Liu J, Xu P, Collins C, Liu H, Zhang J, et al.

The severity of HAND varies, ranging from asymptomaticneurocognitive impairment to its severest form: HIV-1-associateddementia [2]. Despite the widespread use of potent antiretroviraltherapy (ART), the incidence of HAND has not been fullyprevented and its prevalence remains high ranging from 39% to52% in varied settings [3,4,5]. Although the persistence of HAND ismultifactorial, the paucity of effective therapeutic modalities in thecontrol of brain macrophage and microglia activation and resultantproduction of neurotoxins, a striking pathological feature in HIV-1-infected brain, plays an important role as pathogenesis and severityof HAND is highly correlated with activated brain macrophagesand microglia but not the presence and amount of virus in the brain[6,7]. It is well known that the activated microglia secrete a numberof neurotoxins including, but not limited to, pro-inflammatorycytokines, and excitatory amino acids, reactive oxygen species(ROS), nitric oxygen (NO), which can result in neuronal injury andconsequent neurocognitive impairments [8,9,10]. As such, studieson elucidation of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 triggersmicroglial neurotoxicity and identification of specific target(s) tocontrol microglia activation are imperative.Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels have recently gainedmuch attention as the potential targets for therapy of neurologicaldisorders [11,12]. Electrophysiological studies of microglia inculture and tissue slices have demonstrated that microglia expressseveral types of Kv channels including inward rectifier Kir2.1 andoutward rectifiers Kv1.5 and Kv1.3. Exposure to a variety ofactivating stimuli produces a characteristic pattern of up-regula-tion of Kv1.3 [13,14,15,16]. Whereas the expression of Kir2.1channels are often found in resting microglia [17,18], theexpression of Kv1.5 and Kv1.3, especially the latter, appear tobe associated with microglia activation and neurotoxin production[15,19,20,21]. Indeed, studies have shown that activation ofmicroglia results in neuronal injury through a process requiringKv1.3 activity in microglia. Studies have also shown that blockingmicroglia Kv1.3 or decrease of Kv1.3 expression inhibits microg-lia-induced neurotoxicity [22,23]. We hypothesize that HIV-1brain infection triggers microglia neurotoxic activity by increasingKv1.3 activity, resulting in microglia activation and consequentneuronal injury. To test this hypothesis, we studied involvement ofKv1.3 in HIV-1 Tat protein-induced microglia activation andresultant neurotoxic activity in primary microglia culture preparedfrom Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results demonstrated that HIV-1Tat increases microglia production of neurotoxins and resultantneurotoxicity through enhancements of Kv1.3 protein expressionand outward K+currents, which can be blocked by pretreatmentPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904of microglia with specific Kv channel blockers Margatoxin (MgTx)or 5-(4-Phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (PAP), or by transfection ofmicroglia with Kv1.3 siRNA, suggesting an involvement ofKv1.3 in microglia-mediated neurotoxic activity. The enhance-ments of Kv1.3 channel activity and microglia neurotoxicityresulting from HIV-1 Tat protein exposure are dependent on theErk1/2 MAPK signal pathway. Here we present evidence for thereduction of neurotoxic secretions from microglia and associatedneuronal injury by modulation of K+channel activity as apotential new treatment approach deserving further investigation.Materials and MethodsAnimalsSprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles RiverLaboratories (Wilmington, MA) and maintained under ethicalguidelines for care of laboratory animals at the University ofNebraska Medical Center. All animal-use procedures werereviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care andUse Committee (IACUC) of University of Nebraska MedicalCenter (IACUC # 00-062-07).Primary microglia and neuron culturesMicroglia were derived from the cerebral cortices of 0\u20131 day oldneonatal Sprague Dawley rats as described previously [24].Cortical tissues were dissected in cold Hanks\u2019 Balanced SaltSolution (HBSS: Madiatech, Inc. Manassas, VA) and digested in asolution consisting of 0.25% trypsin and 200 Kunitz DNase(Sigma, St. Louis. MO) at 37uC for 30 min. Tissues were thensuspended in cold HBSS and filtered using 100 mm and 40 mmcellular strainers (BD Bioscience, Durham, NC). Isolated cells(306106) were plated into T75 cm2 flasks in a high-glucoseDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). After 10 day\u2019s culture,flasks were shaken gently to detach cells, which were plated basedon experimental requirements in either 35 mm2culture dishes(2.56106 cells/dish), 60 mm2 culture dishes (7.56106 cells/dish),12-well plates (16106/well), or 96-well plates (0.46106/well) andincubated at 37uC. After 30 min, suspended glial cells wereremoved by aspiration of culture supernatant and fresh culturemedia was applied. The resulting cultures were stained with OX-42 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK), a microglial CR3/CD11breceptor marker, and determined to consist of 98\u2013100% microglia.Primary cortical neurons were prepared from 18-day oldSprague Dawley embryonic rats (Charles River Laboratories).Dissected cortices were digested with 0.25% trypsin and DNase(200 Kunitz) in 37uC for 15 min, then filtered through 100 and40 mm pore cellular strainers. Isolates were seeded in pre-coatedpoly-D-lysine plates at a density of 0.056106 cells/well in 96-wellplates, 0.156106 cells/well in 24-well plates, or 1.06106 cells/wellin 6 well-plates. Neuronal cultures were maintained at 37uC for 10days in neurobasal medium (Gibco by Life Technologies)supplemented with 2% B27, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and0.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen by Life Technologies). Thepurity of neuronal cells was determined to be .90% by stainingwith microtubule-associated protein-2 antibody (MAP-2: 1:1000,Chemicon International, Inc. Temecula, California).ElectrophysiologyWhole-cell outward K+currents were recorded from primaryrat microglia cultures at room temperature. Microglia wereperfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) contained (inmM) NaCl 150, KCl 4.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, andglucose 11. The ACSF was continuously oxygenated with 95% O2and 5% CO2 with a pH of 7.4 and an osmolarity of 310 mOsm.Patch-clamp electrodes were made from borosilicate glasscapillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with a resistance of 4\u20136 V whenfilled with pipette solution contained (in mM) KCl 150, MgCl2 1,CaCl2 1, EGTA 11, and HEPES 10; adjusted to a pH of 7.3 withKOH. Voltage-dependent currents were evoked by voltage steps(600 ms in duration) with the first step from the holding potentialof 270 mV to 2170 mV and then stepped to +50 mV with a20 mV increments [13]. The seal resistance was 1\u201310 GV.Junction potentials were corrected and the cell capacitance wascompensated (,70%) in most cells. Current signals were amplifiedwith an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,CA). The current traces were displayed and recorded on a Dellcomputer using a pClamp 10.1 data acquisition/analysis system.K+current density (pA/pF) was calculated by dividing the peakcurrent amplitude generated at a given voltage step by the cellcapacitance.Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Nitricoxide (NO) productionIntracellular ROS were measured by fluorometric assay using29, 79-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma, St. Louis,MO), a well-established compound for detecting and quantifyingintracellular ROS production. Microglia were first treated for30 minutes with a KV1.3 channel blocker, either 5 nM MgTx,10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP (all purchased from Sigma-AldrichCo, LLC, St. Louis, MO), followed by treatment with either200 ng/ml of HIV-1 Tat1-72 protein (Tat) or heat inactivated-Tat1-72 (HI Tat) (purchased from University of Kentucky). After24 hr, microglia were exposed to 20 mM DCFH-DA for 30 min.Cells were then washed twice in PBS and the fluorescenceimmediately measured in a plate reader at an excitationwavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.NO production was estimated by measuring the concentrationof nitrite using the Griess Reagent System according to themanufacturer instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). 50 ml aliquotsof supernatant were collected from cultures of pre-treatedmicroglia, mixed with equal volume of Sulfanilamide Solutionfor 10 min, combined with 50 ml of NED solution, and incubatedfor 30 min at room temperature. The optical density was thenmeasured at 520 nm and 540 nm using an ELISA plate reader.All experiments were repeated at least three times.Cytokine assayCytokines IL-1b and TNF-a in pre-treated microglia superna-tants were quantified using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems) in accordance with manufac-turer protocol.TUNEL staining and MTT assayNeuronal apoptosis was evaluated using a Fluorescein In SituCell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,IN). In brief, neurons growing on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips(0.156106 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were exposed tosupernatants collected from pre-treated microglia at 1:5 dilutionfor 24 hr. Neurons were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde(PFA) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Neurons weresubsequently incubated in the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hrat 37uC and then mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagentwith 49,69-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) counterstain (Molecu-lar Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were visualized using the 406oil-HIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904immersion objective of a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope(Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The percentage ofapoptotic neurons was determined based on TUNEL-positive cellsnormalized to DAPI-stained nuclei.Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Pre-treated neuronswere exposed to fresh neurobasal medium containing 500 mg/ml3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide(MTT) for 3 hr. The MTT solution was then replaced with300 ml of dimethyl sphingosine (DMSO: Sigma-Aldrich) for celllysis and the optical density (OD) was measured at 560 nm.ImmunocytochemistryMicroglia were seeded on coverslips at a density of 1.06106/well in 12-well plates, treated for 30 min with 5 nM MgTx,10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP, and incubated with Tat (200 ng/ml).After 24 hr, cells were washed, fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, andincubated with 10% normal goat serum blocking solution for30 min. Primary antibodies (Ab) anti-CD11b Ab (CD11b; 1:500;abcam, Cambridge, MA) and anti-KV1.3 (KCNA3 1:100,Alomone Lab Ltd, Jerusalem Israel) were then applied tocoverslips for 3 hr at RT. Cells were subsequently incubated for1 hr with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugatedsecondary Abs (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen by LifeTechnologies). After washing, cells were mounted using ProLongGold antifade reagent with DAPI counterstain (Molecular Probes).Images were obtained using the 406 oil-immersion objective of aZeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope. A minimum of 5 imageswere taken from each slide.ImmunohistochemistryBrain hippocampal tissues were dissected out from 20\u201330 d oldSprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories), cut into slicesat 400 mM in thickness, and placed on a 100 mm pore cellularstrainer in a 6-well plate. The hippocampal slices were thentreated for 30 min with MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP(1 mM) and subsequently incubated with 200 ng/ml of Tat. After24 hr, hippocampal slices were fixed in 4% PFA for another 24 hr,immersed in 30% sucrose for 48 hr, embedded in optimal cuttingtemperature (OCT) media, and cryosectioned to a thickness of10 mm. Hippocampal sections were then immunostained witheither anti-Iba1 Ab (1:500, WAKO Chemicals USA, Inc.Richmond, VA), KV1.3 Ab (1:200, Santa Cruz biotechnology,Inc, CA), or TUNEL stain and visualized using the 406 oil-immersion objective of a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope.A minimum of 5 images were taken from each slides.Western blot analysisMembrane proteins were prepared using a Membrane ProteinExtraction Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA) accordingto manufacturer instruction, while total proteins were isolatedusing a RIPA buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Well volumes of20 mg for membrane proteins and 30 mg for total proteins wereseparated by electrophoresis using 4\u201315% Mini-PROTEAN TGXprecast gel and transferred to nitrocellulose polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membranes. PVDF membranes were thenblocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) (allproducts from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and probedovernight at 4uC with either rabbit polyclonal KV1.3 (1:100;Alomone Lab, Israel), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (pERK1/2), totalp44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology,Danvers, MA), or anti-mouse b-actin monoclonal antibody(1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) primary Abs. Membranes were nextwashed (4610 min) in TBS with 0.2% Tween (TBS-T) andincubated for 1 hr at RT with either horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody(1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,PA). Labeled proteins were visualized by Pierce ECL WesternBlotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Banddensities of p-pErk1/2 were normalized to total ERK1/2 in eachsample.Reverse transcription (RT)-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from microglia using TRIzol Reagent(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), purified by RNeasy Mini Kit(QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA), and reverse transcribed at 65uCfor 50 min according to SuperScript III reverse transcriptase(Invitrogen) protocol. PCR amplification with Platinum PCRSuperMix (Invitrogen) then included 2 min incubation at 94uCfollowed by 30 cycles consisting of a 30 s denaturing phase at94uC, a 30 s annealing phase at 55uC, a 1 min extension phase at72uC, and a final extension phase of 10 min at 72uC. Densitom-etry analysis of DNA products was performed using NorthernEclipse 6.0 software (Bio-Rad) and results normalized to b-actininternal controls. PCR primers used were as follows: forwardKv1.3 primer was GTA CTT CGA CCC GCT CCG CAA TGA;reverse Kv1.3 primer was GGG CAA GCA AAG AAT CGCACC AG; forward b-Actin primer was GTG GGG CGC CCCAGG CAC CA; reverse b-Actin primer was CTT CCT TAATGT CAC GCA CGA TTT C.siRNA transfectionPre-designed ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA againstrat KCNA3 (Kv1.3, NM-019270) mRNA was purchased fromDharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). Microglia plated to 26106 cells/well in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 ml of 2 mM siRNAfor 48 or 72 hr in the presence of Dharma FECT TransfectionReagent (Dharmacon, Inc) according to the manufacturerinstruction. A non-specific ON-TARGETplus GAPD ControlPool siRNA (rat) (Dharmacon, Inc) was also similarly transfectedat the same concentration as the control. Transfected microgliawere then incubated for 24 hr with or without Tat (200 ng/ml),after which the supernatant was collected (for conditioned media)and the cells were harvested (for preparation of RNA and protein).Statistical AnalysisExperimental data are expressed as mean6S.D. unless other-wise indicated. Statistical analyses were performed by Student ttests. A minimum p value of 0.05 was estimated as the significancelevel for all tests.ResultsHIV-1 Tat exposure induces Kv1.3 currents in microgliaHIV-1 pathogenesis involves the release of soluble viral proteinssuch as gp120, Tat, and Nef. In previous studies, we demonstratedHIV-1 gp120 IIIB enhanced whole-cell outward K+current incultured rat microglia through Kv1.3 channels [24,25]. Here wepropose HIV-1 Tat protein may alter microglia channel profiles ina similar manner. To test our hypothesis, we first examined theeffect of HIV-1 Tat protein on the electrophysiological propertiesof microglia. Although sera levels of HIV-1 Tat have beenreported to range from 1\u201340 ng/ml in HIV-1 positive individuals[26,27], localized concentrations are reasoned to be higher andnM concentrations are commonly used in vitro to elicit the effects ofTat exposure [28,29]. In our study, purified rat microglia werepretreated with HIV-1 Tat protein at 20\u20131000 ng/ml for 24 hrbefore recording. Electrophysiological recordings were performedusing a conventional whole-cell recording under voltage clampHIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904configuration. The average inward K+current (Iin) and outwardK+current (Iout) densities (pA/pF) were calculated by dividing theK+current amplitude by the membrane capacitance. At hyper-polarizing potentials, both untreated and Tat treated microgliadisplayed an Iin (Fig. 1A). The Iin density in untreated microglia(28.9663.76 pA/pF; n = 32) was only minimally affected byexposure to either 20 ng/ml Tat (28.1463.61 pA/pF; n = 25),200 ng/ml Tat (215.567.36 pA/pF; n = 27), or 1000 ng/ml Tat(212.967.21 pA/pF; n = 24). With depolarizing pulses however,Tat treated microglia responded with a substantial Iout (Fig. 1A). Infact, the Iout density in microglia pretreated with 20 ng/ml Tat(22.6967.46 pA/pF; n = 25) was over fourfold greater than inuntreated microglia (5.0962.84 pA/pF; n = 32). Furthermore, theIout densities in microglia exposed to 200 ng/ml Tat(30.7616.29 pA/pF; n = 27) and 1000 ng/ml Tat(31.86614.69 pA/pF; n = 24) demonstrate this effect to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1C). To confirm these observations were duespecifically to Tat protein function, we disrupted its tertiarystructure with heat (75uC for 5 hr) prior to incubation withmicroglia. Similarly to untreated cells, microglia treated with200 ng/ml heat-inactivated Tat protein (HI Tat, n = 9) exhibitedhyperpolarization-evoked Iin currents and lacked significant Ioutcurrent in response to depolarizing pulses (Fig. 1B). Next, todetermine whether the Tat-induced Iout currents were conductedvia Kv1.3 channels, Tat-treated microglia were perfused withACSF contained specific Kv1.3 blockers PAP (10 nM), MgTx(5 nM), or a broad spectrum Kv channel blocker 4-AP (1 mM),and the Iout was significantly reduced by 52.1614.72% (n = 8),87.2667.79% (n = 8) or 89.8163.09% (n = 7) (Fig. 1D & 1E).Taken together, these findings strongly suggest HIV-1 Tatexposure induces outward K+currents in microglia throughKv1.3 channels.HIV-1 Tat upregulates KV 1.3 expression in rat microgliaKv channel activity can be altered by numerous factors,including by membrane potential, redox potential, transcription,translation, posttranslational modification, or via direct interactionwith organic molecules or peptides. To better determine themechanism through which Tat induces Kv1.3currents in ratmicroglia, Kv1.3 mRNA and protein levels were ascertained byRT-PCR and western blot. RT-PCR performed after 24 hrincubation of rat microglia with 200 ng/ml Tat protein showedmarked elevation in Kv1.3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A), with Kv1.3mRNA density in Tat-treated cells (1.3260.10) measuring 1.8times greater than in untreated microglia (0.746023). As anegative control, the Kv1.3 mRNA density was measured inmicroglia treated with 200 ng/ml heat-inactivated Tat proteinand found to be essentially unchanged (0.8160.13) (Fig. 2A).Consistent with these effects, treatment of microglia with 200 ng/ml Tat for 24 hr led to a nearly threefold increase in Kv1.3 proteinlevels (Fig. 2B), which was further confirmed and visualized byimmunocytochemical labeling (Fig. 2C). These findings clearlyindicate Tat protein exposure upregulates the expression of Kv1.3channels in rat microglia.Involvement of KV1.3 in Tat-induced microglia-mediatedneurotoxicityHaving established Tat protein exposure increases Kv1.3expression and current density in microglia, we next sought todetermine if this change in channel profile contributes to theneurotoxicity of HIV-1 Tat-activated microglia. Microglial super-natants were first collected after 24 hr treatment with either HIV-1 Tat protein (at doses of 0, 20, 200, and 1000 ng/ml) or heat-inactivated Tat (200 ng/ml). Rat cortical neurons growing onpoly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates were thensubjected to these supernatants (1:5 dilution) for an additional24 hr and neuronal viability was assessed by MTT assay. Asshown in Figure 3C, neuronal cell viability was found to beessentially unaffected at doses of 0 ng/ml (100%) and 20 ng/ml(97.0269.38%), however was progressively and significantlyreduced as the microglial supernatant Tat treatment dose wasincreased to 200 ng/ml (70.1963.33%; p,.01) and 1000 ng/ml(58.4564.65%; p,.01). Neuronal viability was further unaffectedby incubation with supernatant collected from microglia treatedwith heat-inactivated Tat protein (HI Tat, 98.464.48%), demon-strating the dose-dependent reductions in viability to be specific tofunctional Tat protein.Next, the role of Kv channels in Tat-activated microglialneurotoxicity was investigated using a similar experimental designand examining the effect of KV channel blocker pretreatment onneuronal health. Microglia were first pretreated with either 5 nMMgTx, 10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP for 30 min. Based on thecapacity to substantially reduce neuronal viability, a dose of200 ng/ml Tat protein was applied and cultures incubated for24 hr. Microglia supernatants were then collected and added tocultured rat cortical neurons at a dilution ratio of 1:5. After 24 hr,neuronal viability and neuronal apoptosis were assessed by MTTassay and TUNEL staining, respectively. As noted previously, cellviability was shown by MTT assay to be decreased in neuronalcultures exposed to Tat-treated microglial supernatant(70.1963.33%), an effect which was significantly attenuated(p,.01) by the pretreatment of microglia with MgTx(85.4661.00%), PAP (82.9560.54%), or 4-AP (92.8364.66%)(Fig. 3C). The complementary study of neuronal apoptosisrevealed similar findings, with the percentage of apoptotic neuronsgreatly increasing (p,.001) with application of Tat protein(30.6864.3%) compared to control (5.661.3%) (Fig. 3A & 3B).Again, this result was largely reversed (p,.01) when microglialcultures were treated with MgTx (9.5662.78%), PAP(11.7262.42%), or 4-AP (7.2963.84%) prior to the applicationof Tat protein (Fig. 3A & 3B). The recovery of neuronal viabilityand attenuation of neuronal apoptosis by KV channel blockade,including the use of Kv1.3 specific inhibitors, suggests that Kv1.3channel activity greatly impacts Tat-induced microglia-mediatedneurotoxicity.KV1.3 channel blockade decreases neurotoxic secretionsby Tat-activated microgliaThe production and release of bioactive molecules by activatedmicroglia is believed to be the principal pathway in HANDassociated neuropathology. To better clarify the functional role ofKv1.3 channels in this process, we next examined the capacity forTat exposure to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokinessuch as TNF-a and IL-1b, in the presence and absence of Kvchannel blockers. For this experiment, purified microglia were firstpre-treated for 30 min with a Kv channel blocker, either MgTx(5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM), and then incubated with200 ng/ml Tat protein for 24 hr. Subsequent cytokine assaysrevealed marked increases (p,.001) in levels of TNF-a(2.2860.07 ng/ml) and IL-1b (4.1060.68 ng/ml) in the superna-tants of Tat-treated microglia compared to the nearly undetectablelevels in untreated controls (Fig. 4A & 4B). Further, this Tat-induced production of cytokines was significantly inhibited (p,.01)in cultures pretreated with Kv channel blockers MgTx, PAP, or 4-AP. In addition to measuring cytokines, we used a similarexperimental design to measure other neurotoxic microglialproducts including NO and ROS. The level of NO insupernatants from Tat-treated microglia was (23.6560.60 nM)HIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904compared to (0.4260.16 nM) in untreated matched controls(Fig. 4C). This production was significantly limited (p,.01) byblockade of KV channels using either MgTx (15.8160.56 nM),PAP (11.0063.20 nM), or 4-AP (16.9661.60 nM). Similarly,ROS production in Tat-stimulated microglia was found to be590.646160.72% of the level in untreated control (Fig. 4D). Pre-treatment with MgTx, PAP, or 4-AP prior to the addition of Tatsignificantly reduced the levels of ROS to 175.76662.37%,169.91684.58%, and 252.70689.4% of control, respectively.Collectively, these results strongly support a critical role for Kv1.3channels in the production and secretion of neurotoxins by Tat-activated microglia.Neurotoxic activity of Tat-stimulated microglia ismitigated by knockdown of KV1.3 geneHaving demonstrated HIV-1 Tat upregulates Kv1.3 expressionin rat microglia and that Kv1.3 channels are involved in Tat-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity, complementary exper-iments were next performed to address whether gene silencing byknockdown of the Kv1.3 gene (KCNA3) with siRNA wouldattenuate these effects. First, microglia were transfected withKv1.3-siRNA or nonspecific GAPD control siRNA (controlsiRNA) for 48 hr or 72 hr, depending on whether mRNA orprotein expression was to be measured, and incubated with orwithout 200 ng/ml Tat for an additional 24 hr. RT-PCR andwestern blot were then used to examine Kv1.3 mRNA expressionand Kv1.3 protein levels, respectively. As expected, the upregula-tion of Kv1.3 mRNA expression in Tat-stimulated microglia wasefficiently inhibited by transfection with Kv1.3 siRNA ascompared to those transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 5A).Paralleling these results, Tat-enhanced Kv1.3 protein expressionwas found to be significantly decreased with Kv1.3 siRNAtransfection (Fig. 5B).To examine the effect of Kv1.3 channel knockdown on theneurotoxic properties of Tat-exposed microglia, we againemployed measures of neuronal viability and apoptosis. For thisexperiment, microglia were transfected with Kv1.3-siRNA for72 hr and then incubated with 200 ng/ml Tat protein anadditional 24 hr. Microglial supernatants were next collectedand applied at 1:5 dilution to rat cortical neurons. Neurons werethen incubated for an additional 24 hr before being assessed byMTT assay and TUNEL staining. As demonstrated by MTTassay, the decline in neuronal viability due to Tat-exposedmicroglial supernatants (66.8762.55%) was improved by pre-transfection with Kv1.3-siRNA (84.7063.93%) (Fig. 5C).

The capacity for Kv1.3 geneknockdown to mitigate the neuronal damage caused by Tat-activated microglia indicates the upregulation of Kv1.3 mRNAand protein is a key component in the mechanism of thisneurotoxicity.ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway involvement in Tat-induced microglial neurotoxicityThus far we have shown Tat-induced upregulation of Kv1.3channels and currents to be critical to the activation of microgliaand subsequent damage to neurons. To better clarify themechanisms underlying these observations, we next turned ourattention to the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2)MAPK signaling pathway, which has been implicated elsewhere inchronic neurodegenerative disease and may mediate the channelprofile alterations associated with Tat exposure [30,31,32]. Forthis experiment, microglia were exposed to 200 ng/ml Tat andproteins were harvested at various time points for assessment bywestern blot. Our results demonstrate ERK1/2 phosphorylation(pERK1/2) was enhanced by Tat exposure beginning at 30 minand peaking at 5 hr after stimulation (Fig. 6A). To determine ifERK1/2 activation mediates the Tat-induced increases in Kv1.3channel expression and subsequent neurotoxicity, U0126 was usedto inhibit MEK1 and MEK2, the MAPK kinases responsible forphosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK. Reduction of ERK1/2MAPK activity using U0126 (10 mM) was found to markedlyreduce both the expression levels of microglial Kv1.3 (Fig. 6C) andthe neurotoxicity of supernatants collected from Tat-exposedmicroglia (Fig. 6D). These results provide evidence for theinvolvement of the ERK MAPK pathway in Tat-induced Kv1.3expression and consequent microglia neurotoxic activity. Lastlyand perhaps surprisingly, application of MgTx (5 nM), PAP(10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM) to microglia after 30 min of Tatexposure was also found to significantly inhibit the Tat-enhancedphosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6B).KV1.3 channel involvement in ex vivo HIV-1 Tat-inducedmicroglia-mediated neurotoxicityThus far we have demonstrated Tat protein exposure results inthe upregulation of Kv1.3 expression and the production ofneurotoxic substances in cultured microglia. To better approxi-mate in vivo conditions, we next used a rat hippocampal sliceculture to evaluate ex vivo the alterations in microglial Kv1.3expression and neuronal apoptosis resulting from HIV-1 Tatapplication. Hippocampal slices were first dissected from rats aged20\u201330 days, cultured in NeuroBasal medium, and incubated for24 hr with 200 ng/ml Tat protein. Brain slices were then doublestained with the microglia marker Iba1 and Kv1.3 antibodies. InTat protein treated slices, Kv1.3 expression was found to beenhanced and co-localized with Iba1 stained microglia (Fig. 7A).In addition, TUNEL staining revealed Tat-induced neuronalapoptosis could be attenuated with 30 min KV channel antagonistpre-treatment, either MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP(1 mM) (Fig. 7B). These results are fully consistent with our invitro studies and corroborate the involvement of Kv1.3 channels inthe neuronal damage caused by Tat-activated microglia.DiscussionMicroglia are functionally related to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and play an important role as residentimmunocompetent phagocytic cells in the HAND pathogenesis. Aprominent pathological feature in HIV-1-infected brain ismicroglia activation and the activated microglia exert neurotoxiceffects in the brain by releasing a variety of potentially neurotoxicsubstances. In addition to their production of neurotoxins,microglia express a large number of chemokine receptors thatare involved in cell migration and serve as co-receptors for HIV-1infection. Indeed, microglia are the predominant resident CNScell type productively infected by HIV-1 [8,9]. Due to poorpenetration of antiretroviral drugs through the blood-brain barrier(BBB), resident microglia (and brain macrophages) constitute acellular reservoir of HIV-1 in the brain and a source of potentialneurotoxic substances [33,34,35]. Thus, suppression of microgliaproduction of neurotoxins is critical to the control of HAND onsetand progression. In the present study, we demonstrated HIV-1Tat-induced microglia activation and associated neurotoxicityrequires Kv1.3 channel activity. Exposure of microglia to HIV-1Tat protein was found to enhance both Kv1.3 currents andFigure 2.

Suppression of Kv1.3channels, either by Kv1.3 channel antagonists or via geneknockdown, significantly inhibited Tat-induced microglia-mediat-ed neurotoxicity. These findings indicate Kv1.3 channel modula-tion has the potential to mitigate microglia-associated neurotoxicactivity.Microglia express a defined pattern of Kv channels includinginward rectifier Kir2.1 and outward rectifiers Kv1.5 and Kv1.3[19,36]. Exposure to a variety of stimuli produces a characteristicpattern of up-regulation of Kv1.3 and activation of microgliaresults in neuronal injury via a process requiring Kv1.3 activity[13,14,15,16]. In a previous study we found HIV-1 gp120exposure activates microglia, in conjunction with enhancedKv1.3 expression and outward K+currents, leading to neuronalapoptosis [24,25]. The gp120-induced microglial neurotoxicitywas significantly attenuated via suppression of Kv1.3 expression orblockade of Kv1.3 current. Similarly, our present study revealedexposure to HIV-1 Tat increases microglial Kv1.3 channelexpression and outward K+current in association with activation,neurotoxin secretion, and neuronal apoptosis, which weresuccessfully inhibited by either siRNA knockdown of the Kv1.3gene (Fig. 4) or specific Kv1.3 blockers MgTx and PAP (Fig. 1,Fig. 2, and Fig. 7). We confirmed these results in an ex vivo studyusing hippocampal slice culture, in which HIV-1 Tat-inducedmicroglia-mediated neuronal apoptosis was attenuated by pre-treatment with Kv1.3 antagonists MgTx or PAP, or a broadspectrum Kv channel blocker, 4-AP. Collectively, these findingsreveal the integral role of Kv1.3 channels in regulating microgliaactivation and establish a new approach for controlling microgliamediated neurotoxic activity.Although reported in several studies to be associated withdiseases including B cell lymphoma [37], breast cancer [38,39]and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [40], research on the importance ofenhanced microglial Kv1.3 channel activity in HIV-1 relatedcognitive impairment has thus far been sparse. The evidence forthe pivotal role of microglia in HAND pathogenesis is abundanthowever, as microglia are well known to mediate HIV entry intothe brain, serve as a reservoir for productive and latent HIV-1infection, and function as a source of neurotoxic substances[8,19,41,42,43]. After infection with HIV-1, microglia undergodramatic phenotypic, immunological, and functional changes toproduce the cytokines, chemokines, superoxides, and viral proteinsthat result in neuronal injury. In order to determine the role ofmicroglial Kv1.3 in this process, we examined the neurotoxicsecretions of HIV-1 Tat-treated microglia in relation to Kv1.3channel activity. We found blockade of Kv1.3 channels usingeither specific Kv1.3 antagonists, MgTx and PAP, or a broadspectrum KV blocker, 4-AP, was sufficient to inhibit microglialproduction of IL-1b, TNF-a, NO, and ROS. These results areconsistent with our previous findings [24] and suggest enhancedmicroglial Kv1.3 channel activity is required for the HIV-1 Tat-induced secretion of neurotoxins by microglia.HIV-1 Tat exposure has been shown to lead to microglia/macrophage activation, neurotoxin secretion, and subsequentneuronal damage [22,44,45,46] in a process mediated throughmicroglial signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2, PI3K,and p38 MAPK [47,48]. Tat protein has also been shown capableof increasing an outward-rectifying K+current in rat microgliathrough regulation of transcription factor NF-kB [49]. However,while Kv1.3 channel activity has here been demonstrated to benecessary for Tat-induced microglial neurotoxicity, the underlyingFigure 3. Kv channel antagonists attenuate Tat-induced microglia neurotoxicity. Neurons were exposed to conditioned media recoveredfrom microglia pre-treated with MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM) for 30 min followed by Tat at varied concentrations (0, 20, 200, 1000 ng/ml). After 24 hr treatment, TUNEL staining and MTT were performed. A: TUNEL positive neurons were visualized by confocal microscopy at 6400original magnification. Scale bar equals 50 mm. Note that Tat-treated conditioned media, but not heat inactivated Tat (HI Tat)-treated conditionedmedia, induced neuronal apoptosis and that the Tat-induced neuronal apoptosis was blocked by MgTx, PAP or 4-AP.

Although the breadth ofmechanisms for modulating Kv channels are numerous, includingregulation of gene expression, post-translational modification,direct interactions with organic molecules and peptides, andresponsiveness to membrane potential, to name a few, we chose asan appropriate starting place those signaling pathways which canconvert an extracellular signal such as HIV-1 Tat protein into afunctional cellular response. In particular, we focused on ERK1/2,which constitute one of the MAPK pathways that commonlytransduce microenvironmental conditions in microglia and havebeen implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases [30,31,32].Depending on the cell type, the stimulus, and the duration of cellactivation, a variety of biological responses including cellproliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis have beencorrelated with ERK activation [30,31,32]. In the present study,we explored whether ERK1/2 activation was involved in theenhancement of microglial Kv1.3 expression and neuronalapoptosis resulting from exposure to HIV-1 Tat. We foundERK1/2 phosphorylation increased in HIV-1 Tat-treated mi-croglia in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), but could beprevented by pre-treatment with U1026, an inhibitor of theupstream kinase responsible for regulating ERK1/2 activity.Furthermore, pre-treatment with U1026 ameliorated Tat-inducedmicroglial Kv1.3 expression and associated neurotoxicity (Fig. 6C,Fig. 6D), indicating this process is dependent on activation of theERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Lastly, our experiments revealed thenovel finding that HIV-1 Tat-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylationcould be inhibited with Kv channel antagonists, MgTx, PAP, or 4-AP. It appears that while Tat-induced microglial Kv1.3 expressionis dependent on ERK1/2 MAPK, this same pathway is alsoresponsive to Kv currents. Given that Kv currents set themembrane potential and thus influence Ca2+influx, the lattereffect may be mediated through Ca2+-dependent intracellularprocesses or pathways. While more investigation is necessary, thisreciprocal regulation may allow for intervention in the crucialtransition between functional immune activation and reactivemicrogliosis.In this study, we provided evidence demonstrating Kv1.3channels to be an integral component of HIV-1 Tat-inducedFigure 5. Kv1.3 siRNA abrogates neurotoxic activity of Tat-activated microglia. Microglia were transfected with siRNA targetingKv1.3 (Kv1.3-siRNA) or nonspecific GAPD control siRNA (Ctrl-siRNAS) for48 or 72 hr, followed by an additional 24 hr exposure to Tat (200 ng/ml). Cells were then harvested for detections of Kv1.3 mRNA (48 hr post-transfection/24 hr Tat treatment) and Kv1.3 proteins (72 hr post-transfection/24 hr Tat treatment). Supernatants were subjected toneuronal culture. Neuronal apoptosis and viability assay weredetermined using TUNEL staining and MTT assay.

This promising data opens the future possibility of usingKv1.3 channel inhibitors as a novel strategy to combat HAND andother neurodegenerative disorders in which the pathophysiologicalprocess involves microglia-mediated immune and inflammatoryresponses. In a previous in vivo study, we demonstrated theadministration of Kv channel antagonist 4-AP could ameliorateHIV-1-induced encephalitis and cognitive disorder, improvingspatial learning and memory in a severe combined immunodefi-cient (SCID) mouse model of HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) [50].Nevertheless, as Kv channel blockers selectively target immunecells including macrophage, microglia, and lymphocytes, thetherapeutic benefit of this approach must be carefully consideredfor potential risks to the immune system. Of these cells, the mostabundant Kv1.3 channel expression is reported to be found thehuman effector memory T cells (CD4+CCR72CD45RA2), whichregulate Th1 cell inflammatory responses [36,51,52]. The use ofsmall molecule KV blockers, such as verapamil, dilitazem, andnifedipine, has been shown to reduce IL-12 secretion and inhibit Tcell proliferation [53]. Notably, these immunomodulatory effectshave been found to depend heavily on the level of Kv1.3 channelexpression, which changes dramatically as T cells differentiatefrom na\u0131\u0308ve to memory states or transition from resting toactivation [54,55,56]. Given that the immune response functionsof microglia, macrophage, Helper T cells, and B cells remainbasically intact, the potential side effects of pharmacologicallyblocking Kv1.3 channels could be minimal [52,57]. In fact, thepotential side effects of using KV channel blockers to treat a widerange of autoimmune conditions, including those involvingeffector memory T cells, delayed type hypersensitivity, type 1diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammato-ry bone resorption, have been investigated without revealing anygeneralized immunesuppression [58,59,60,61]. Recently, thesafety of this approach was given further credence when the USFood and Drug Administration approved the KV channel blockerdalfampridine (Ampyra) as a treatment multiple sclerosis (http://www.fad.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnouncements/ucm198463.htm).In summary, the present study serves to establish the integralrole of Kv1.3 channel activity in HIV-1 Tat-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. The identification of Kv1.3 channels as apoint of intervention in this process may open new avenues fortherapeutic modalities. Given its feasibility and safety, it may nowbe advantageous to consider studying a Kv1.3 channel-basedtherapeutic approach in the treatment of HAND and otherneurodegenerative disorders characterized by microglia-mediatedneuroinflammation.AcknowledgmentsThe Authors thank Ms. Julie Ditter, Ms. Robin Taylor, Ms. Johna Bellingand Ms. Sandra Wiese for their excellent administrative support.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: JL HX.
