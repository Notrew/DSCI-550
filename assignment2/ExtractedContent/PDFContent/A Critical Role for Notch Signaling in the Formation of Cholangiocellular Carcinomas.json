Using a transgenic mousemodel, we found that expression of the intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD) in mouse livers results in theformation of intrahepatic CCCs. These tumors display features of bipotential hepatic progenitor cells, indi-cating that intrahepaticCCCcan originate from this cell type.We show that human andmouseCCCsare char-acterized by high expression of the cyclin E protein and identified the cyclin E gene as a direct transcriptionaltarget of the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, blocking g-secretase activity in human CCC xenotrans-plants results in downregulation of cyclin E expression, induction of apoptosis, and tumor remission in vivo.INTRODUCTIONCholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is a primary liver cancer withbiliary differentiation (Patel, 2006). Several recent studiesdescribe a significant increase in the incidence of this tumor inEurope and the United States; the reasons for this increase arenot understood (El-Serag et al., 2009; von Hahn et al., 2011;West et al., 2006). Even though CCC accounts for up to 15%of all liver cancers, the molecular alterations that lead to thisdisease are mostly unknown. Predisposing conditions such asprimary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic infection with liver flukes,or biliary stones led to the hypothesis that chronic inflammationof the biliary epithelium might be a prerequisite for the formationof CCC. However, no uniform genetic alteration has been identi-fied that is responsible for the formation of CCC. In addition, onlyvery few mouse models of CCC are currently available. RecentlyXu and colleagues showed that liver-specific disruption of theSMAD4 and PTEN genes leads to the formation of CCC (Xuet al., 2006).

For example, loss of the Notch ligand jagged1 or the Notch2 gene results in congenital hypoplasia of the biliary system,called the Alagille syndrome (Geisler et al., 2008; Lorent et al.,2004; Ryan et al., 2008). Analysis of mice after liver-specific inac-tivation of RBP-Jk, a common transcriptional mediator of Notchsignaling, revealed a reduced number of biliary cells differenti-ating from hepatoblasts (Zong et al., 2009). Notch levels areregulated by ubiquitylation-dependent protein turnover, whichis controlled by the SCFFbw7 E3-ubiquitin ligase (Welcker andClurman, 2008). The F-Box component of this E3-ligase, theFbw7 protein, was found to be frequently mutated in humanCCC (Akhoondi et al., 2007). However, it is unknown whetherNotch dysregulation is involved in the initiation and progressionof CCC.ulation of the oncogene cyclin E, resulting in the formation oferation and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

We used a transgenicmouse line that allows the liver-specific expression of the intra-cellular domain of Notch receptor 1 (NICD).RESULTSExpression of Notch ICD in Mouse Liver Interferes withHepatocyte ProliferationTo directly test the consequences of constitutive Notch expres-sion in liver tissue, we crossed a transgenic mouse line thatallows for tissue-specific overexpression of the intracellulardomain of Notch 1 (Rosa26Notch1IC) (Murtaugh et al., 2003) toa mouse line that expresses cre-recombinase under the controlof the albumin regulatory elements and the alpha-fetoproteinenhancers (AlbCre) (Kellendonk et al., 2000). Use of this cre-line results in the expression of NICD in the vast majority ofall hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells during the forma-tion of the second ductal layer (E16.5) (Zong et al., 2009).NotchIC::AlbCre mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios,but showed proportionally reduced body and liver weights (Fig-ures 1A\u20131C) and up to 25% reduced body size (Figure S1A [age,7 months] available online) compared to wild-type control litter-mates.

As shown in Fig-ure S1B, only the liver expressed detectable amounts of GFP,while in all other tested organs the transgene was not activated.To ensure expression and activity of the intracellular domain ofNotch in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, we performed immu-nostainings on mouse liver tissue from NotchIC::AlbCre miceand wild-type controls, using antibodies specific for the cleavedform of Notch. As shown in Figure 1D, NICD expression wasdetected in both cell types in the transgenic animals but not inwild-type liver controls. In line with a constitutive activation ofNotch signaling, we also detected strong expression of HES1,a transcriptional target of the Notch pathway in Notch IC::AlbCrelivers (Figure 1D) and in liver lysates (Figure 1E).Given the expression of Notch ICD in hepatocytes and thebiliary compartments of the liver, we first set out to analyze thefunctional consequences of Notch expression in hepatocytes.Upon histologic examination of theNotchIC::AlbCre liver tissues,we detected a significant increase in the cell size of the NICD-positive hepatocytes as well as variations in nuclear size in trans-genic livers compared to wild-type controls (Figure 2A). Serumtransaminases and different liver metabolites were also changedin NotchIC::AlbCre mice compared to wild-type controls (Fig-ure S1C). To measure the size of individual hepatocytes, westained liver sections with a specific antibody against betacatenin (Kossatz et al., 2004) and quantified the differencesbetween NotchIC::AlbCre and wild-type controls (Figures 2Aand 2B). In accordance with an increase in cell size, we alsonoticed a reduction in the number of hepatocytes per visual fieldin the NotchIC::AlbCre compared to wild-type livers (Figure 2C).Because an increase in hepatocyte size can be the result of achange in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, we determinednuclear sizes and DNA content in NotchIC::AlbCre mice andwild-type control mice. As shown in Figure 2A, the nuclei ofhepatocytes in NotchIC::AlbCre mice are significantly largerthan those in control mice. To analyze if these changes wereparalleled by an increase in the amount of nuclear DNA, weperformed Feulgen staining and measured the DNA content ofsingle nuclei by cytometry. As shown in Figure 2D, we foundthat the nuclei of hepatocytes in the NotchIC::AlbCre mice arenot only enlarged but also contain significantly more DNA thanthe nuclei of nontransgenic control livers. Nuclear enlargementand an increase in DNA content are often the result of endoredu-plication cycles in which the cell undergoes continuous rounds ofDNA replication without cytokinesis (Kossatz et al., 2004). To testwhether the NotchIC::AlbCre livers also display alterations withregard to cellular proliferation, we performed partial (two-thirds)hepatectomies in NotchIC::AlbCre transgenic animals andcompared their regenerative potential with that of wild-typeorgans. As shown in Figure 2E, expression of NotchIC::AlbCreleads to an almost complete loss of regeneration potential insix mice per time point were counted.

This lack of proliferation wasaccompanied by a significant increase in hepatocyte cell sizeand a reduction in cell number after partial hepatectomy, therebyindicating that the NotchIC::AlbCre mice regenerated their livermass through cellular hypertrophy of the remaining hepatocytes(Figure S1D). At themolecular level we found that wild-type liversdownregulate the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and started toexpress S phase cyclins E and A after induction of cell cycle pro-gression by partial hepatectomy (Figure 2G). Importantly and incontrast to wild-type livers, we detected elevated levels of cyclinE and cyclin A even before partial hepatectomies were per-formed in NotchIC::AlbCre expressing livers. Together theseresults suggest that the expression of the intracellular domainof Notch in hepatocytes results in the induction of endoredupli-cation cycles and a severe impairment of cellular proliferation.Expression of Notch ICD in Mouse Livers Leads to theFormation of Progenitor Cell Derived CholangiocellularCarcinomasTo understand the long-term consequences of NICD overex-pression, we followed a cohort of mice for up to 15 months. In7-month-old mouse livers, we observed areas with clusters ofsmall cells with an epithelial appearance (Figure 3A) that alsoformed gland-like structures. To determine the origin of thesecells, we stained liver sections with antibodies specific for thebiliary tract (CK7, CK17, and CK19), hepatocytic markers(CK8/18), and the stem cell marker CD34. As shown in Figure 3A,the small epithelial cells stained positive for biliary-hepatocyticas well as stem cell markers, a finding which is typical for cellsthat show characteristics of hepatocytic and cholangiocytic dif-ferentiation. Such cells often arise through the transformation ofbipotential hepatic progenitor cells (Kim et al., 2004), which arelocated in the canals of Hering.Importantly, as early as 8 months after birth we started toobserve changes in nuclear morphology in primary liver tissuesfrom NotchIC::AlbCre mice. To test whether the observed cellswere indeed tumor cells, we transplanted primary tissue fromNotchIC::AlbCre mouse livers subcutaneously on the flanks ofimmunodeficient mice. All implantations resulted in the formationof tumors. Figure 3B shows the growth curve of the subcutane-ous tumors that arose after cell transplantation. Histopathologicanalysis revealed that these tumors show many features ofhuman CCCs (Figure 3C), including the expression of CK7 andCK17 and a typical desmoid reaction of the surrounding tissue.Liver tissue from Alb-Cre mice was used as a control and didnot give rise to tumors (Figure S2G). These results suggestedthat intrahepatic expression of NICD in hepatic progenitor cellscan induce differentiation of these cells toward the biliary lineageand that, over time, NICD expression induces malignant trans-formation of these cells. To directly test this hypothesis, wein the wild-type mouse was set as 100%.

Vector-infected cellsserved as controls. Figure S2A shows the expression levels ofNICD in such cells compared to empty vector-infected cells.Cells stably expressing NICD were subcutaneously injectedinto nude mice and tumor growth was analyzed over time. Whilecontrol vector-transduced cells did not give rise to tumors,NICD-overexpressing cells formed subcutaneous tumors (Fig-ure 3D) in all transplantation experiments. These tumorsshowed all features of CCCs (Figure 3E). Interestingly, tumorsarising from progenitor cells stably transduced with c-Myc anda constitutive active form of Akt showed a different histopathol-ogy and were classified as undifferentiated hepatocellular carci-nomas/hepatoblastomas (Figure 3E). These results indicate thatexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch leads to tumorformation in all transgenic mice and can transform hepatic pro-genitor cells thereby leading to the development of CCCs.Notch Signaling Leads to Dysregulated Expressionof Cyclin E and Genetic InstabilityTo understand the molecular pathogenesis of Notch-dependentCCC formation, we focused our analysis on the function of thecyclin E protein. As shown in Figure 2G, cyclin E is highly ex-pressed in NotchIC::AlbCre-derived liver tissue even before theonset of liver regeneration (time point 0). In line with this finding,we detected high levels of cyclin E protein within the CCCsderived from NotchIC::AlbCremice (Figure 4A). Previous studieson the oncogenic function of cyclin E suggested that cyclin E in-duces DNA damage, thus resulting in genetic instability andcontributing to the formation of malignant tumors (Sprucket al., 1999). We therefore tested if cyclin E-overexpressing chol-angiocellular tumors might show signs of DNA damage by stain-ing primary mouse CCC tissues derived from NotchIC::AlbCremice with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form ofSer-139 of histone H2AX (gH2AX), a marker for DNA double-strand breaks. As shown in Figure 4B, we found that morethan 70% of all cells in these CCCs show signs of DNA damageas compared to wild-type liver tissue. Similarly, tumor tissuesderived from nude mice transplanted with primary tumor cellsfromNotchIC::AlbCre also showed high levels of cyclin E expres-sion and stained positive for gH2AX (Figure 4C). Mice expressingonly cre-recombinase do not show any signs of genetic insta-bility as measured by gH2AX staining (Kossatz et al., 2010).We then determined whether a reduction in cyclin E expressionwould reduce the number of gH2AX-positive cells. Figure 4Dshows that transfection of human MzChA1 cholangiocarcinomacells with siRNAs against cyclins E1 and E2 (Figure S2B) led to asignificant reduction in the number of gH2AX-positive cells.Based on these results, we speculated that Notch signalingmight be directly involved in the regulation of the cyclin E pro-moter and thus in the induction of genetic instability and CCCinitiation and progression. Interestingly, the cyclin E1 promotercontains several Rbpjk binding sites that could be involved inthe regulation of the promoter by NICD signaling. We used a pre-viously described cyclin E1 promoter luciferase reporterconstruct (Geng et al., 1996) to measure promoter activity inthe CCC cell with or without NICD overexpression. To determinethe activity of the cyclin E gene, we transfected the CycE-Lucpromoter construct into CCC cells (MzChA1, TFK1) andmeasured luciferase expression in these cells as compared tothat in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2). Asshown in Figure 4E, we found higher basal levels of cyclin E pro-moter activity in the CCC cell lines as compared to levels in livercancer cells (Hep3B) or hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2). Next, wedetermined whether NICD was able to induce the activation ofthe cyclin E promoter. Cotransfection of NICD with the CycE-Luc reporter construct resulted in a more than 10-fold inductionof the cyclin E promoter (Figure 4E). Moreover, cotransfection ofNICD with an expression plasmid for the dominant-negativeco-activator Mastermind prevented the activation of the cyclinE promoter by NICD, indicating that the activation of the cyclinE promoter was a direct consequence of NICD activity.Given the importance of cyclin E expression for the generationof genetically unstable CCC cells, we next tested whether theinduction of cyclin E is required for the observed oncogenictransformation of bipotential hepatic progenitors. For thispurpose, we transduced NICD-expressing liver progenitor cellswith retroviruses for stable expression of two different shRNAsagainst cyclin E. After selection, we measured the knockdownlevel of cyclin E in these cell populations (Figures S2C and S2D)and transplanted these cells subcutaneously into immunodefi-cient mice. As shown in Figure 3D, compared to ICN-expressingcells that were transduced with control shRNAs, there was astrong inhibition of tumor development from cells with stableexpression of cyclin E shRNAs together with ICN. Overall, onlyone mice developed tumors (mouse 1a,1b). Western blot anal-ysis of the tumor tissue showedprofound cyclin E protein expres-sion (Figure S2E), indicating a selection against RNAi-mediatedcyclin E knockdown in these particular tumors. Our results sug-gest that expression of NICD results in the activation of the cyclinE promoter and increased cyclin E expressionwhich, through theinduction of genetic instability, leads to the formation of CCCs.Notch 1 and 3 Are Overexpressed in HumanCholangiocellular CarcinomaPrompted by these results, we next tested whether the Notchpathway is also active in human CCC cells and tissues. We firstdetermined the expression and activity of the Notch signalingpathway in three established human CCC cell lines (TFK1,MzChA1, and EgI1) and also in a primary cell line that we derivedfrom a CCC tumor specimen (SZ1). As shown in Figure 5A, allCCC cell lines expressed the Notch1 receptor as well as theNotch ligand jagged while hepatocellular or colon carcinomacell lines did not show an activation of this pathway (Figure S2F).To determine whether the Notch signaling pathway is active inCCC cells, we used an antibody that recognizes the cleavedform of Notch 1 (Notch val 1744) and the downstream targetgene Hes1. As shown in Figure 5A, all CCC cell lines expressedthe activated form of the Notch receptor and the HES1 protein,indicating that the Notch signaling pathway is active in thesetumor cells but not in HeLa cells, which we used as a control.To ensure that the NICD transgenic mouse line is an adequatemodel system, we compared the expression levels of NICD inthe CCCs that arose in our transgenic animals to the levels ex-pressed in the human CCC cell lines. As shown in Figure 5B,mouse tissue and human CCC lines express comparable levelsof cleaved Notch and HES1 protein.

As shown in Figure 5C and in the diagram in Figure 5D,we found that the majority of all CCCs overexpress the Notch 1receptor.

Using the Kendall tau-b rank test, we found thatcyclin E1 and Notch 1 showed a highly significant (p < 0.001)co-expression in the CCC tissues tested. These results suggestthat overexpression of Notch promotes the expression of thecyclin E gene through activation of the cyclin E promoter, whichresults in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks in humanCCC cells.Notch Signaling as a Therapeutic Target in CCCOur analysis of primary CCC tissues and the observation thatNICD transgenic mice develop CCCs point toward a centralrole of the Notch signaling pathway in the formation of thesetumors. To test whether the expression of Notch was alsorequired for CCC maintenance, we transfected the cells withsiRNAs specific for Notch 1. As shown in Figure 6A, loss of Notch1 expression led to a reduction in HES1 and cyclin E expressionwhile p53, p27, and p21were strongly induced. Forty-eight hoursCancer Cell 23, 784\u20137after the transfection of Notch 1 siRNA,approximately 50% of all MzChA1 cellshad undergone apoptosis (Figure 6B).Combined ablation of Notch 1 and 3 bysiRNA led to an even more pronouncedeffect, indicating that signaling throughboth receptors is required for CCC main-tenance (Figures S4A and S4B).Notch signaling depends on g-secre-tase-mediated generation of NICD, whichtranslocates to the nucleus to induce acell type-specific transcriptional pro-gram. To test whether g-secretase inhibi-tion of Notch signaling might constitute atreatment option against CCC,we treatedthese cells with the g-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluoro-phenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). Asshown in Figure 6C, DAPT treatment resulted in a time-depen-dent decrease in the expression of the cleaved form of the Notchreceptor and theNotch target geneHes1. Similar resultswere ob-tained with other CCC cell lines (Figure S4C). In line with ourobservation that Notch controls cyclin E transcription, DAPTtreatment also led to adecrease in cyclin Eexpression inMzChA1cells as determined by RT-PCR (Figure S4D). To determine thefunctional consequences of Notch inhibition, we determinedthe number of apoptotic MzChA1 cells after treatment withDAPT. As shown in Figure 6D, DAPT treatment of MzChA1 cellsresulted in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cellsasmeasuredby the activation of caspases 3and7. This decreasein viability was accompanied by a significant reduction of BrdUuptake (FigureS4E) and a strong increase in the expression levelsof the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as the tumorsuppressor protein p53 (Figure S4F). Similar results were foundin the other CCC lines (EGI-1, TFK-1) (data not shown).Finally, we tested whether inhibition of Notch signaling wouldalso affect the growth of xenotransplanted human CCCs.

Cells derived from cell lineSZ1 were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneouslyinto immunodeficient mice. When the tumors reached a size ofapproximately 150\u2013200 mm3, mice were treated with DAPT ata concentration of 50 mg/kg every 72 hr. As shown in Figure 6Eand Figure S4G, inhibition of g-secretase resulted in a significantinhibition of tumor growth as compared to untreated controls.This inhibition of tumor growth was accompanied by the induc-tion of p21, p27, and p53 and a downregulation of cyclin Eexpression in the primary tumor tissues (Figure 6F). Histologicexamination of these tumors revealed, in accordance with theresults we had obtained using CCC cell lines, that treatmentwith DAPT resulted in the induction of apoptosis in the xeno-transplanted tumors as shown by TUNEL staining of the primarytissues (Figure S4H).DISCUSSIONThe pathogenesis of CCC is only incompletely understood. Anumber of genetic and epigenetic changes as well as alterations792 Cancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.in growth factor signaling have beendescribed. Nevertheless, treatment op-tions are still sparse and given the lack ofa detailed understanding of the underlyingpathogenesis, targeted therapies are diffi-cult to implement. In this study, we used atransgenic mouse line that expresses theintracellular domain of the Notch 1 recep-tor in liver cells starting at day 9.5.Our phenotypic andmolecular analysis of theNotchIC::AlbCremice revealed opposite roles for Notch signaling in the hepaticand cholangiocytic compartments. We found that NICD-overex-pressing hepatocytes undergo endoreduplication cycles thatresult in the formation of polyploid liver cells. This defect inmitotic cell division is also apparent in liver regeneration experi-ments that show that NICD-expressing hepatocytes fail to re-enter the cell cycle after a partial hepatectomy. In line with ourfindings Croquelois and colleagues showed that loss of Notch1 in hepatocytes led to the overproliferation of hepatocytes,which caused the formation of regenerative nodules (Croqueloiset al., 2005). Together, these results suggest that Notch signalingin hepatocytes is primarily antiproliferative and prevents uncon-trolled proliferation of liver cells.We found that overexpression of NICD results in the formationof CCCs, implicating this signaling pathway in the pathogenesisof this tumor. Zong and colleagues convincingly showed thatectopic Notch expression led to the formation of biliary epithelialcells in the hepatic lobule (Zong et al., 2009). Moreover, expres-sion of Notch in livers of 6-day-old mice led to the formation ofectopic biliary structures within the liver. Their experimentsCancer CellNotch Induces Cholangiocellular Carcinomatherefore argue for the ability of Notch signaling to induce a fatedecision in hepatoblasts or even terminally differentiated hepa-tocytes that allows them to differentiate toward the biliarylineage. The ability of hepatocytes to change their fate decisionunder the influence of AKT and Notch signaling or under condi-tions of chemically induced carcinogenesis has been shownrecently (Fan et al., 2012; Sekiya and Suzuki, 2012). Thesestudies provided evidence that hepatocytes localized aroundthe central vein can be transformed into biliary cancers. Whilea growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that humanCCC is derived from intrahepatic stem cell compartments(Cardinale et al., 2012; Nakanuma et al., 2010), it needs to beshownwhether a change in cellular differentiation can contributeto human CCC pathogenesis. Recent data in other systems indi-cate that Notch signaling drives intestinal cell fate determinationof progenitor cells, for example, those lining the intestinal crypts,and blockade of Notch signaling via gamma secretase inhibitionforces intestinal progenitor cells to differentiate into goblet cells(van Es et al., 2005; Zecchini et al., 2005). This pathologic profileis reminiscent of that seen inHes-1 deficientmice, a downstreamNotch target gene (Kodama et al., 2004). Our analysis showedthat expression of NICD in mouse liver cells results in the forma-tion of CCCs, which in addition to cholangiocytic features, alsoexpress surface markers associated with stem cells therebyindicating that NICD expression in undifferentiated liver progen-itor cells might have transformed those cells into tumor cells. It isnot known how the expression of Notch ICD in differentiatedcholangiocytes may also result in the formation of cancers.The finding that NICD expression in hepatic progenitorsresults in the formation of CCCs was further substantiated bythe fact that cells isolated from these primary tumors led to theformation of CCC after transplantation into nude mice. Giventhe high plasticity of these cells, we cannot exclude that Notchsignaling might lead to the formation of tumors that resemblefeatures of hepatocellular carcinoma or even mixed phenotypes(Villanueva et al., 2012). We therefore set out to directly provethat aberrant Notch signaling in bipotential liver progenitor cellscauses the formation of CCC. To this end, we created progenitorcell lines that stably express NICD and found that these cells didindeed start to form tumors that show all characteristics of CCCsafter transplantation into mice. These tumors also showedelevated levels of cyclin E expression and a high degree ofgenetic instability. We therefore concluded that liver progenitorcells can act as the cells of origin in the formation of CCCs inresponse to Notch signaling.A central question that arose out of these findings is how theexpression of NICD can lead to the formation of CCC. In thiswork, we found that cyclin E protein levels are greatly increasednot only in CCCs derived from NotchIC::AlbCre mice, but alsoin primary human CCC tissues. Several mouse models havedemonstrated that deregulated cyclin E expression is causallyassociated with tumorigenesis in vivo. Overexpression of humancyclin E in mammary or thymic tissues, or prevention of cyclin Edegradation throughmutation of the T380 phosphorylation site inmouse cyclin E, resulted in the formation of tumors (Hwang andClurman, 2005; Loeb et al., 2005). The oncogenic function ofcyclin E is coupled to its ability to induce double-strand breaksthat ultimately result in the formation of genetically unstablecells. Using gH2AX as a marker for double-strand breaks, weshowed that the tumors derived from NotchIC::AlbCre mice aswell as tumors derived from NICD-expressing bipotential pro-genitors show high levels of DNA double-strand breaks andthat reduction of cyclin E expression ameliorates this phenotype.Interestingly the dysregulation of cyclin E expression is causedby an increased transcription of the cyclin E promoter inresponse to NICD expression a finding that defines cyclin E asa direct transcriptional target of the Notch signaling pathway.Given that suppression of cyclin E expression by shRNA treat-ment results in a complete suppression of tumor formation inNICD-expressing liver progenitors, we conclude that cyclin E isindeed a critical downstream effector of Notch signaling-induced tumor formation.Our observations together with the data provided by Zong andStanger therefore suggest that Notch signaling can induce abiliary differentiation program in hepatocytes or hepatic progen-itor cells, which together with the aberrant expression of thecyclin E protein results in the formation of intrahepatic CCCs. Itis currently unknown why the Notch 1 and 3 receptors are upre-gulated in CCC cells. T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breastcancer, and other tumors or cell lines derived from such cancersshow genetic alterations that affect the expression of differentcomponents of the Notch signaling pathway (Koch and Radtke,2007).Recently, Fbw7, the F-Box protein that controls the turnover ofNotch 1 as part of a SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase, was shown to bemutated in up to 35% of all CCCs examined (Akhoondi et al.,2007). This result points to a defect in Notch turnover that mightcontribute to the increase in protein levels. Interestingly theSCFFbw7 complex also ubiquitylates the cyclin E1 and E2 pro-teins and loss or mutation of the Fbw7 protein results inincreased cyclin E expression (Koepp et al., 2001; Welckeret al., 2003). We have shown that overexpression of the NotchICD in mouse livers leads to an increase in cyclin E expressionand that Notch ICD can directly transactivate the cyclin E1 pro-moter. Loss of Fbw7 might therefore cause an increase in cyclinE levels not only through a reduction of cyclin E ubiquitylationand turnover, but also through an increased transcription ofthe Cyclin E gene through the Notch signaling pathway.CCCs frequently arise under conditions of chronic inflamma-tion. The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/gp130 signaling system constitutesan important component of the inflammatory response in theliver and was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis ofCCCs. This aberrant overexpression of IL-6 is a consequenceof the epigenetic silencing of the suppressor of cytokinesignaling 3 (SOCS-3) (Isomoto et al., 2007). Intriguingly IL-6 isable to induce a Notch-3\u2013dependent transcriptional activationof the jagged gene in breast cancer cells (Sansone et al.,2007). Dysregulation of Notch signaling might therefore be aresult of alterations in its proteolytic turnover and exogenousfactors like the stimulation of jagged transcription by IL-6. Whilethis hypothesis awaits experimental proof, our experimentsusing isolated NICD-expressing progenitors show that transfor-mation of these cells does not require additional inflammation.To date, no specific treatment exists for patients with CCCsthat are not eligible for surgery. We therefore set out to testwhether inhibition of Notch signaling would interfere with theproliferation and survival of CCC cells. Loss of Notch signalingeither by inhibition of g-secretase or by suppressing NotchCancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 793Cancer CellNotch Induces Cholangiocellular Carcinomaactivity through siRNA-mediated ablation of Notch 1 and 3expression resulted in the induction of cell cycle arrest andapoptosis. Notch inhibition also led to the regression of estab-lished xenotransplant tumors derived from CCC cell lines in vivo.Inhibition of g-secretase activity might therefore constitute amolecular target that interferes with the dysregulated expressionof cyclin E.In this study we found that NotchIC::AlbCre mice not onlyformed ectopic biliary structures, but also intrahepatic CCCs.Together with the observation that Notch can induce a biliarycell fate in bipotential progenitors lead to the idea that the path-ogenesis of intrahepatic CCCs might differ significantly from theformation of biliary tumors that arise primarily from the bile ducts(i.e., Klatskin carcinoma). Our data suggest that intrahepaticCCC might constitute a tumor that forms as a result of aberrantNotch signaling in hepatic progenitors that transform into tumorcells. Moreover we show that inhibition of Notch signaling consti-tutes an attractive target for future clinical trials in patients withintrahepatic CCCs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Partial Hepatectomy ProceduresROSA26 NICD mice (Murtaugh et al., 2003) were crossed with AlbCre mice(Kellendonk et al., 2000) to generate mice with a liver-specific overexpressionof the activated form of the Notch 1 receptor.

The actin blot corresponding to the protein extracts from the wild-type mouse livers was duplicated andinadvertently used for the Notch-ICD mouse livers. The correct actin blot is now shown in the revised Figure 2G below.In Figure 6F, the actin blot derived from Figure 6A, which shows that downregulation of Notch 1 by siRNA leads to a reduction of cyclinE levels, was erroneously duplicated in Figure 6F, which shows that inhibition of Notch activity by DAPT leads to cyclin E downre-gulation. In the revised Figure 6F shown below, the correct actin blot has been used.Finally, in Figure S2F, the blot for cleaved Notch expression had been duplicated and erroneously labeled as Cyclin E. The correctcyclin E blot is now shown in the revised figure below.While none of these errors affect the results or conclusions of this work, the authors would like to apologize for any confusion thismight have caused.Cancer Cell 30, 349\u2013365, August 8, 2016 \u00aa 2016 Elsevier Inc. 353mailto:nisar.malek@med.uni-tuebingen.dehttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.ccell.2016.07.005&domain=pdfhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2016.07.005A BC DE FGFigure 2.
