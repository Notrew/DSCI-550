The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it is derived from osteoblasts, whichtransdifferentiate into adipocytes that produce bone marrow fat. We examined the dose-dependent effect of 17b-estradiolon the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived osteoblasts toundergo osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. We found that 17b-estradiol significantly increased alkaline phosphataseactivity (P,0.05); calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn expression levels dose-dependently. By contrast, 17b-estradiol significantly decreased the number and size of lipid droplets, and Fabp4 and PPARc expression levels during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation (P,0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers (Myf5, Elovl3, andCidea) and undifferentiated adipocyte markers (Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b) were also affected by 17b-estradiol during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. Western blotting and immunostaining further showed that canonical Wnt signaling can beactivated by estrogen to exert its inhibitory effect of osteo-adipogenesis. This is the first study to demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of 17b-estradiol on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs likely viacanonical Wnt signaling. In summary, our results indicate that osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation modulated by canonicalWnt signaling pathway in bone metabolism may be a new explanation for the gradually increased bone marrow fat inestrogen-inefficient condition.Citation: Gao B, Huang Q, Lin Y-S, Wei B-Y, Guo Y-S, et al.

There exists an inverse relationshipbetween bone marrow fat production and bone formation duringosteoporosis, namely, adipogenesis is inhibited in patients with ahigh bone mass [2,3]. However, the origin of bone marrow fat, thephysiological role of adipocytes in bone marrow, and the reasonsfor the increase in adipogenesis during osteoporosis and theabnormal adipogenic differentiation of BMMSCs are unclear.In recent years, a correlation has been established between theosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of bone marrow cells andnumerous bone metabolism diseases. Tuan et al. [4] have shownthat hBMMSC-derived osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocyteshad the potential to transdifferentiate to each lineage, and thesefindings provided new insights on the pathogenesis of skeletaldiseases such as osteoporosis. Nevertheless, If and to what extentestablished key factors or signaling pathways of normal osteogen-esis and adipogenesis play a role in the transdifferentiation processremains unknown.Estrogen can regulate several signaling molecules such as Notch,Erk, and Ephrin, which function in bone metabolism [5,6,7,8].Endogenous estrogens also play an important role in thedevelopment of bone marrow fat. Not only does uncoupling ofthe bone remodeling units caused by a decrease in estrogen levelsespecially after the menopause, there is also a notable increase inadipogenic switch in bone marrow accompanied by a decline inbone mass [9,10]. Several studies have shown that estrogen is anegative regulator of adipogenesis [11,12] and essential forosteogenic commitment [13]. For example, estrogen simulta-neously induces osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis both in vivoand in vitro, which led us to hypothesize that estrogen regulatesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099137&domain=pdfosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation and increases fat depositionin the osteoporotic marrow.The wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signalingpathway plays a fundamental role during embryogenesis andnormal cell development. Recent studies in humans have shownmutations in Wnt signaling molecules to result in different diseases[11,12,13]. Importantly, Wnt signaling also regulates bonedevelopment, adipogenic differentiation, and gene expression inwhole process of bone metabolism [14,15]. Specifically, canonicalWnt/b-catenin signaling is highly animate in mesenchymalprecursor cells and in directing pluripotent cells, especially towardthe osteoblast lineage while inhibiting adipogenic differentiation.Canonical Wnt signaling is also involved in the suppression ofadipogenesis. For example, canonical Wnt signaling stabilizes andpromotes cellular and nuclear b-catenin levels, which inhibitadipogenesis [16], and the suppression of Wnt signaling isindispensible for PPARc induction and preadipocyte differentiation[17].Although estrogen can modulate Wnt signaling directly orindirectly and affect bone metabolism [18,19,20], it is not known ifestrogen and Wnt signaling are involved in osteo-adipogenictransdifferentiation. Therefore, we used estrogen-deficient murinein vitro and in vivo models to investigate the effects of estrogen andcanonical Wnt signaling on osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation,as well as to define the underlying mechanism.Materials and MethodsMaterialsa-Modified minimal essential medium (a-MEM) and Dulbec-co\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) were purchased fromThermo Scientific (Beijing, China).

All RT-PCR experiments were performed intriplicate, and the primers used for PCR experiments are listed inTable 1.Western BlottingCells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4,containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin) onice for 30 min. For western analysis, 300 mg of total protein wasresolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto aPVDF membrane. Anti-b-catenin (1:10000) and anti-GSK-3b(1:5000) antibodies were used for immunoblotting. b-Actin wasused as a loading control. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugatedsecondary antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Images wereanalyzed by Scion Image software. Immunoreactive bands werequantitatively analyzed in triplicate by normalizing the bandintensities to b-actin on scanned films with Alpha Image software.ImmunostainingCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min,permeabilized with methanol for 10 min, and incubated withanti-b-catenin (1:250) antibody and anti- GSK-3b (1:250) over-night. On the following day, cells were incubated with a DyLight594 and 488 secondary antibody (Abcam) for 1 h. After stainingnuclei with DAPI (0.5 mg/ml) for 5 min, the cells were analyzedunder a FV1000 model confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,Japan). b-catenin positive cells were counted, and the percentagesof cells positive for b-catenin and cells positive for nuclear b-catenin were calculated.Statistical AnalysisData were expressed as means 6 S.D. of multiple repeats of thesame experiment (n = 5).

ALP activity assay, alizarin red and oil red staining(Fig. 1A, B, and Fig. 2A) showed 17b-estradiol to suppress osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. Specifically, the mineralized ma-trix area of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in the presence of 17b-estradiol for 14 days was larger than that of cells cultured in thepresence of ICI. 17b-Estradiol also affected the morphology offully-differentiated adipocytes and decreased the number and sizeof lipid droplets. However, this effect could be neutralized whenICI was used to inhibit the effect of 17b-estradiol, indicating thatestrogen inhibits osteo-adipogenic transdiffentiation. Moreover,ALP activity, calcium deposition, and the quantification of lipidFigure 4.

In addition, 17b-estradiol increased (Fig. 1E) anddecreased (Fig. 2C) the levels of osteogenic and adipogenicmarkers, whereas there were no changes in cells simultaneouslytreated with 17b-estradiol and ICI. To confirm the delicatechanges in osteo-adipogenic transdiffentiation, we examined theexpression levels of pre-adipogenic markers, namely, Dlk1, Gata2,and Wnt10b in MC3T3-E1 cells. Figure 2C showed thatdedifferentiation preceded the process of transdifferentiation andwith the induction of adipogensis getting longer, fully-differenti-ated osteoblasts regained their ability to multi-differentiate into theadipogenic lineage, whereas fully-differentiated adipocytes dedif-ferentiated in the presence of 17b-estradiol. Figure 2D also showedthat 17b-Estradiol downregulated the expression levels of brownadipocyte markers, namely, Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea, duringtransdifferentiation, indicating that activation of brown adipogenicgenes may be occurring, but at a much later stage in thetransdifferentiation process.Estrogen Dose-dependently Regulates the Osteo-adipogenesis Transdifferentiation of Primary BMMSCsTo expand the role of 17b-estradiol in transdifferentiation, weused an ovariectomized C57BL/6 mouse model to investigate theability of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate underosteoporotic conditions. We found the transdifferentiation poten-tial of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the OVX group to behigher than that of control cells. In addition, the expression levelsof osteogenic markers in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from theOVX group were lower than those in cells from the control. After7 and 14 days of adipogenesis, the expression levels of adipogenicmarkers increased (Fig. S2). By morphological analysis, BMMSCsderived osteoblasts from the OVX group transdifferentiated intothe adipogenic lineage more easily than cells from the sham-Figure 5.

ALP activity assay, and alizarin red and oil redstaining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A) also showed differences in osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation between groups. Specifically, themineralized matrix area of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from theOVX group was smaller than that of cells from the control. Themorphology of fully-differentiated osteoblasts from the OVXgroup was also different compared to that of control cells, with amarked increase in the number and size of lipid droplets.To determine the optimal concentration of 17b-estradiol for theinduction of transdifferentiation, BMMSCs derived osteoblastswere treated with increasing concentrations of the hormone. Ourresults showed transdifferentiation of BMMSCs derived osteoblastsfrom the OVX group to decrease with increasing concentration of17b-estradiol. This was accompanied by an increase in themineralized matrix area and a decrease in the number and size oflipid droplets as shown by an ALP activity assay, and alizarin redand oil red staining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A). However, there wasno difference in the ability of cells treated with 17b-estradiol at161027 M and 561027 M to transdifferentiate by RT-PCR andmorphological analysis. These findings were supported by resultsfrom the calcium deposition, and the quantification of lipidnumber and size (Fig. 3C, D and Fig. 4B). To inhibittransdifferentiation, 17b-estradiol was used at 161026 and161025 M; however, there were no changes compared to161027 M. Thus, the potential for osteo-adpogenic transdiffer-entiation was greater in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from theOVX group than that of control cells, and with the intervention ofoptimum concentrations of 17beta-estradiol, the potential gotweaker, which further proved the dose-dependent effect ofestrogen on the transdifferentiation process.Estrogen Suppresses Osteo-adipogenicTransdifferentiation via Canonical Wnt SignalingTo understand the role of canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation, we used recombinant WNT-3aand DKK-1 proteins to activate and inhibit this pathway,respectively. We found significant increases in ALP staining andactivity; calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocnexpression levels in cells treated with WNT-3a, 17b-estradiol, andICI (P,0.05) (Fig. 5G). However, there was a decrease in theexpression levels of bone formation markers when cells weretreated with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 (Fig. 5A, B, D, and E). Theco-incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 alsoincreased the number and size of lipid droplets (Fig. 5C, F) andreduced Fabp4, PPARc, Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b expression levels(Fig. 5H). By contrast, the incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol,WNT-3a, and ICI decreased the expression levels of adipogenicmarkers. Furthermore, western blotting and immunocytochemis-try showed canonical Wnt signaling to affect osteo-adipogeictransdifferentiation in the presence of estrogen and ICI. Specif-ically, Western blot showed that Wnt-3a accompanied with1027M of 17beta-estradiol and ICI increased b-catenin expres-sion level, while reduced the expression of GSK-3b level. On theFigure 6.

Moreover, immunostaining showed that WNT-3a, 17b-estradiol, and ICI increased the levels of total and therelative nuclear b-catenin while decreased the level of total Gsk-3b, whereas DKK-1 inhibited the effect induced by 1027M of17b-estradiol (Fig. 6B, C).From the data presented above, we firmly believed that dose-dependent estrogen can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-ention effect of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine BMMSCs derivedosteoblasts via partially or maybe dependently controllingcanonical Wnt signaling pathway.DiscussionThis study showed for the first time the dose-responsive effect of17b-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murineBMMSC-derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate into adipocyteslikely via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Transdifferentia-tion is the irreversible switching of differentiated cells thatsometimes occurs during disease [29]. It occurs when partiallydifferentiated cells (e.g., pre-osteoblasts) switch to another lineage(e.g., adipocytes) [30]. This phenomenon can occur betweencommitted or differentiated osteoblasts and adipocytes, and it haseven been reported to occur at the single cell level [31,32,33,34].The adipogenic transdifferentiation potential of MC3T3-E1cells has been previously shown by the ectopic expression ofadipogenic transcription factors, namely, PPARc, C/EBPa, or both[35]. Moreover, several factors can regulate osteo-adipogenictransdifferentiation, which is consistent with our finding that 17b-estradiol can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation ofMC3T3-E1 cells. In this study, we used time-dependent in vitrotransdifferentiation models and reported that MC3T3-E1 cellsunderwent osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation under properconditions. With increasing time after osteogenic induction, theosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation potential decreased. Specifi-cally, the transdifferentiation potential of 3- and 7-day-oldosteogenic MC3T3-E1 cells was higher than that of 14- and 21-day-old cells (Fig. S1). However, 3- and 7- day-old osteogenicMC3T3-E1 cells did not fully differentiate into mature osteoblasts.Therefore, the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation effect of themcan hardly win applause. Moreover, the osteo-adipogenictransdifferentiation potential of 21-day-old osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cells was hardly observed both by RT-PCR and morphologicalanalysis. Therefore, transdifferentiation was studied in 14-day-oldosteogenic adipocytes.Estrogen can regulate the differentiation potential of BMMSCsinto the osteoblast or adipocyte lineage. Recent studies haveshown a correlation between a decreased estrogen level aftermenopause and a marked increase in bone marrow adipogenesis[9,10]. In light of these findings, we used an ovariectomized mousemodel to investigate the effects of 17b-estradiol on transdiffer-entiation. We found the transdifferentiation potential to be higherin BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the OVX group than that ofcontrol cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of 17b-estradiol could partially or completely reverse osteo-adipogenictransdifferentiation in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts, illustratingthe dose-dependent effects of estrogen. Although estrogen hasbeen shown to inhibit and promote adipogenesis and osteogenesisboth in vivo and in vitro, respectively [9,36,37], this is the first studyto demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of estrogen on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and murineBMMSCs derived osteoblasts and further efforts should be madeurgently to clarify the detailed mechanism among the magictransdifferentiation process.Santanam et al. showed that an in vitro E2 concentration of1029to 1028M is generally regarded as a physiologic concen-tration. Although men have lower estrogen level compared towomen, the level may be still higher than the physiologic levelwhich is enough to maintain bone mass in vivo [38]. Moreover,the mechanism of osteoporosis is very complex and estrogen onlyfunctions as one part of the metabolism process. There are stillmany other factors which control the bone mass such as androgens[39], PTH [40], mechanical stress [41], diet [42] and metabolismof calcium and phosphorous [43]. And these factors mightcompensate the role of low-level estrogen on bone metabolism ofmen.Having established that MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSC-derivedosteoblasts transdifferentiated into adipocytes, the expression levelsof several brown fat-specific markers were examined to determinewhether the cells being formed were white or brown adipocytes.Recent findings from lineage tracing studies have shown thatbrown adipocytes develop in vivo from a myf5-positive progenitorcell [44], suggesting that myf5-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells andBMMSCs might develop into brown adipocytes. In this study, myf5expression in MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs was upregulatedwhen cells were cultured in adipogenic medium. Other brownadipocyte-specific markers such as Elovl3 and Cidea were alsoactivated in cells cultured in adipogenic medium, but not until day7 of adipogenic differentiation, and their expression was morevariable. These results demonstrate that activation of brownadipogenic genes may be occurring, but at a later stage in thetransdifferentiation process, for which further investigation isrequired. Although 17b-estradiol failed to upregulate brown fatgenes, our results indicate that the dose-dependent changes in lipidaccumulation correlate with white rather than brown adipogen-esis.We also found that osteo-adipogenic transdifferention upregu-lated adipogenic markers such as PPARc and Fabp4, butdownregulated osteogenic markers such as Alp, Runx2, Col1a1,and Ocn. Moreover, the expression levels of Dlk1, Gata2, andWnt10b, which are highly expressed in undifferentiated preadipo-cytes, were induced. These results indicate that transdifferentiationprocess combines the effect of transdifferentiation, dedifferentia-tion, proliferation and differentiation together. Specifically, thededifferentiation effect was indeed happened prior to thetransdifferentiation, and with the induction of adipogenesis gettinglonger, fully-differentiated osteoblasts regained the multi-differen-tiation potential and then differentiated to adipogenic lineage.What\u2019s more, under the intervention of 17b-estradiol, fully-differentiated mature adipocyte could be dedifferentiating again.Gustafson et al. [45] have shown that Wnt signaling in matureadipocytes increases the b-catenin level, resulting in the dediffer-entiation of 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte cells, which may have beenmodulated by canonical Wnt signaling [46,47,48]. Activation ofcanonical Wnt signaling has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis[16], and inhibition of Wnt signaling, especially WNT-3a, isessential for PPARc upregulation and preadipocyte differentiation[17]. These findings are in line with previous studies that show theinvolvement of estrogen and canonical Wnt signaling in bonemetabolism [18,19,20]. Luis et al. have also demonstrated that thetransdifferentiation of human osteoblasts into adipocytes increasedafter treatment with fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor blocker.They also suspected the transdifferentiation process might berelated to down-regulation of b-catenin [49]. These inspired usabout the mechanism of Wnt signaling on the transdifferentiationEstrogen Suppresses Transdifferentiation via Wnt Signaling PathwayPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137of MC3T3-E1 cells and primary murine BMMSCs derivedosteoblasts under estrogen control.We used MC3T3-E1 cells to investigate the roles of estrogenand canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-adipogenic transdifferentia-tion. 17b-estradiol dose-dependently inhibited the transdifferentia-tion of MC3T3-E1 cells via canonical Wnt signaling partially ordependently. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytochem-istry results showed that WNT-3a activated canonical Wntsignaling and inhibited osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation inde-pendent of 17b-estradiol and ICI. DKK-1 also blocked canonicalWnt signaling to relieve the inhibition of the osteo-adipogenictransdifferentiation from the presence of 17b-estradiol. These dataindicate that canonical Wnt signaling might act downstream ofestrogen to regulate osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. Theseresults also support the plasticity of MC3T3-E1 cells andBMMSC-derived osteoblasts, and they suggest that these cellscan be used for cell engineering. In light of the findings thatcanonical Wnt signaling induces the dedifferentiation of fully-differentiated adipocytes and inhibits the transdifferentiation ofosteoblasts, it is possible that perturbations in this signaling cascademay result in bone metabolism diseases such as osteoporosis.Given the widespread prevalence of estrogen deficiency,especially in post-menopausal women, it is important to under-stand the role of this hormone in osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-entiation. Moreover, the involvement of canonical Wnt signalingin this cellular process is likely to provide further insights on thepathogenesis of osteoporosis.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Effect of different time-point of the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.MC3T3-E1 cells were divided with two groups.
