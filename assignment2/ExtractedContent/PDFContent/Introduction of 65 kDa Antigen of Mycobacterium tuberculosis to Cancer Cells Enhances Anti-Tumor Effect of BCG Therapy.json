"Introduction of 65 kDa Antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to Cancer Cells Enhances Anti\u2010Tumor Effect of BCG TherapyImmunotherapy with BCG has anti-tumor effectsagainst bladder cancer.  The response rate to BCG instil-lation therapy by carcinoma in situ (CIS), which wasthought to be an indication for radical cystectomy, isabout 70% (25).  BCG instillation therapy is also effec-tive for patients with T1 grade 3 superficial bladder can-cer, which frequently develops into invasive bladdercancer (11).  However, the exact mechanism of BCGinstillation therapy remains obscure.  To improve andunderstand the process of BCG immunotherapy, theanti-tumor mechanism must be identified.We investigated the usefulness of immune-gene ther-apy using cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL2) (3, 5),IL12 (4, 17, 18, 27) and IL18 (8).  These studies showedthat tumor cells expressing cytokines significantly retard-ed tumor growth in syngeneic mice.  Moreover, theyalso worked as tumor vaccines in preventing a responseto a subsequent challenge with parental cells.  Indeedintroducing cytokine genes is one type of immune genetherapy.  Another is to have the host more efficiently rec-ognize tumor cells as being immunogenic.  To improvethe BCG therapy, we introduced the gene encoding themajor antigen, 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp), ofMycobacterium tuberculosis into a mouse melanomacancer cell line.  We then analyzed the anti-tumor effectof BCG against this cell line.Materials and MethodsCell line and animals.

Accepted January 21, 2004Abstract: Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy has anti-tumorigenic effects against bladder can-cer. To improve the efficacy of BCG therapy, we introduced the gene encoding the 65 kDa heat shock pro-tein (hsp) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into a mouse malignant melanoma cell line (B16). An expressionvector harboring the 65 kDa antigen gene was transfected into B16 using Lipofectamine, then expressionof the antigen was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Several cell lines expressing 65 kDa anti-gen were established (B16/65kDa). We also established a control cell line transfected with the vectoralone (B16/con). All cell lines (B16, B16/con, B16/65kDa) were injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic micewith or without BCG prior immunization and the development of tumor ascites was examined. To analyzethe mechanism of the anti-tumor effect, CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells were depleted in vivo by administeringthe corresponding monoclonal antibody. B16/65kDa expressed the 65 kDa hsp of M. tuberculosis. The tumorgrowth of B16/65kDa was slightly retarded in naive mice, but significantly inhibited by BCG. The anti-tumoreffect was totally abrogated in mice deficient in CD4 T cells, suggesting that CD4 T cells are involved in thisprocess. The 65 kDa hsp of M. tuberculosis was expressed after gene transduction in a malignant melanomacell line and significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy. CD4 T cells play an impor-tant role in this anti-tumor effect.Key words: BCG, Gene therapy, 65 kDa antigen289Microbiol.

Shinnick(21), the gene encoding the 65 kDa protein of Mycobac-terium tuberculosis, was inserted into a mammalianexpression vector plasmid (pCEXV3) (16).Gene transfection.  The expression vector harboringthe 65 kDa gene (pCEXV3/65kDa) was co-transfectedwith pSV2neo (selection gene) into B16 cells usingLipofectamine.  Briefly, 1.8\ufffd105 B16 cells were seededinto 60 mm dishes 16 hr before transfection.  PurifiedpCEXV3/65kDa (9 \u00b5g) or pCEXV3 (9 \u00b5g; mock trans-fection) were transfected with 48 mg of Lipofectaminereagent and 3 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM (Life Tech-nologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., U.S.A.).  The plas-mids were co-transfected with 1 \u00b5g of pSV2neo as aselection marker (24).  Colonies were selected using 1mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.) 3 daysafter transfection, picked up by cloning cylinders andexpanded into cell lines.Cell proliferation assay.  To compare the in vitroproliferation of B16 sublines, 5\ufffd103 cells of each cellline were seeded in each well of 12-well plates, and thenumber of cells in each cell line was counted daily bytriplicate.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Total RNA wasisolated from transfected cell lines using acid-guani-dinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform.  Complemen-tary DNA was synthesized from 2 \u00b5g of RNA by exten-sion with oligo dT in 20 \u00b5l of reverse transcriptase reac-tion buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.01 M DTT, 0.5 mMdeoxynucleotide phosphate and 200 U of SuperscriptII (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y., U.S.A.).  The mix-ture was incubated at 42 C for 50 min, then at 70 C for15 min.The cDNA for 65 kDa protein of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis was detected by PCR amplification in sep-arate reactions, using oligonucleotide primers.  PCRproceeded using a Perkin Elmer Cetus Gene Amp PCRsystem 9600 (Norwalk, Conn., U.S.A.) in 25 \u00b5l of reac-tion mixture for 30 cycles (1 min at 95 C, 1 min at 62 Cand 2 min at 72 C) using rTth DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer).  Non-specific priming and oligomerization wasminimized using hot-start PCR.  Cycling was concludedwith a final extension of 7 min at 72 C.  A sample of eachreaction (10 \u00b5l) was analyzed in a 2% agarose gel andvisualized by ethidium-bromide fluorescence staining.The primers were: 5'-ACGATCACCAACGATGGTGTG-3'5'-AGCTGACCAGCAGGATGTAGG-3' (corre-sponding size: 529 bp)Western blotting.  Expression of the 65 kDa protein intransfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting.Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl,1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride).  After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4C, lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on 4\u201320%SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes at a constant current of 35 mAfor 4 hr.  Non-specific binding on the membranes wasblocked in PBS containing 10% powdered nonfat milk at4 C overnight.  The membranes were then incubatedfor 1 hr with an anti-65 kDa protein monoclonal antibody(7) in PBS containing 1.0% BSA, and washed twicefor 5 min each with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20.The membranes were then incubated for 1 hr with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody(DAKO, A/S, Denmark).  After washing as describedabove, specific proteins were detected using diaminoben-zidine (Wako Chemical, Tokyo).Animal model of BCG therapy.  To establish a BCGimmunotherapy model, C57BL/6 mice were administeredwith 1 mg of live BCG intraperitoneally once each weekfor 2 weeks.  The mice were challenged with tumorcells (5\ufffd106 cells) administered intraperitoneally oneweek after the last BCG administration.  The presence ofcancer ascites was examined 3 times each week and thepercentage of ascites in free mice was calculated.Immunodeficient mice.  T cells were depleted in vivoby the intraperitoneal administration of rat MAb GK1.5(anti-CD4; IgG2b) and MAb 2.43 (anti-CD8; IgG2b) (bothhybridomas were acquired from the ATCC).  TheseMAbs were used as ascites fluids (titer, \ufffd1:10,000according to mouse thymocyte staining by flow cytom-etry).  The MAb preparations (0.2 ml) were injectedi.p. on day \ufffd3 and every 7 days thereafter.  Throughoutour experiments, respective T cell sub-populations weredepleted by \ufffd97% according to indirect immunofluo-rescence staining and cytofluorometric analysis (EPICSElite, Coulter, Fla., U.S.A.) of splenocytes using theMAbs GK1.5 (CD4) or 2.43 (CD8), respectively (Fig. 1).ResultsExpression of 65 kDa Antigen in Transfected CellsThe presence of 65 kDa antigen mRNA was screenedin transfected clones by RT-PCR.  Parental and mock-transfected B16 (B16/con) did not express 65 kDa anti-gen mRNA.  Clones B16/65kDa-1 and B16/65kDa-2expressing 65 kDa antigen mRNA were selected foruse in further experiments (Fig. 2).  Expression of 65 kDaantigen protein was confirmed by Western blotting inB16/65kDa-1, B16/65kDa-2 (Fig. 3).  We then com-pared the proliferation rates in vitro among the B16290 I. HARA ET ALsublines.  There was no significant difference in cellproliferation in vitro among these cell lines (data notshown).Tumorigenicity of 65 kDa Antigen Expressing B16 inSyngeneic MiceTo examine the effect of 65 kDa antigen on tumorgrowth in vivo, 5\ufffd106 cells of B16, B16/con, B16/65kDa-1 and B16/65kDa-2 were injected intraperitoneally tosyngeneic C57/Bl mice.  B16 and B16/con developed asimilar degree of ascites.  On the other hand, B16/65kDa-1 and B16/65kDa-2 slightly retarded ascites formation(Fig. 4) and in the following experiments, the results werethe same.  Thus, representative data of B16/65kDa-1,described as B16/65kDa are shown.BCG Immunotherapy Model (Fig. 4)Injecting the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic mice with5\ufffd106 B16 cells caused tumor ascites to form within 2weeks.  However, two prior intraperitoneal injections291IMMUNO-GENE THERAPY USING MYCOBACTERIAL MAJOR ANTIGENFig. 1. Fluorometric analysis (EPICS Elite) of control, CD4-depleted and CD8-depleted mouse.

RT-PCR of parental and B16 cell lines transfected with 65 kDa gene expressing 65 kDa mRNA. The corresponding band wasobserved in transfected cell line (B16/65kDa-1, B16/65kDa-2), but not in parental and mock-transfected lines (B16, B16/con).of 1 mg of BCG significantly inhibited ascites formation.B16/con elicited a similar anti-tumor effect.  To confirmthat BCG specifically caused the anti-tumor effect, weinjected the same amount of E. coli using the sameschedule.  However, tumor growth in vivo was not affect-ed (data not shown).  None of the mice injected witheither BCG or E. coli alone developed ascites.We examined how the expression of 65 kDa antigen intumor cells affects BCG immunotherapy.  The anti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy was remarkablyenhanced by 65 kDa antigen expression.  Although BCGimmunotherapy inhibited tumor formation by parentalB16 cells, all of the mice eventually developed ascites.On the contrary, 40% of mice injected with B16/65kDacompletely rejected the tumor.Mechanism of BCG ImmunotherapyTo elucidate the mechanism of BCG immunotherapy,immuno-deficient mice were established using a mono-clonal antibody against the corresponding CD molecule292 I. HARA ET ALFig. 3. Western blots of parental and B16 cell lines transfected with the gene expressing 65 kDa protein. The corresponding band wasobserved in transfected cell lines (B16/65kDa-1, B16/65kDa-2), but not in parental and mock-transfected lines (B16, B16/con).Fig. 4. Growth of tumor ascites in mice intraperitoneally injected with 5\ufffd106 B16, B16/con and B16/65kDa cells.Formation of tumor ascites was examined 3 times each week and the percentage of ascites free mice was calculated. Y axis: percentageof ascites free mice. X axis: days after injection of tumor cells. Mice pre-immunized with 1 mg of live BCG twice are described asB16\ufffdBCG, B16/con\ufffdBCG and B16/65kDa \ufffd BCG.(Fig. 1).  The anti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapyagainst B16/65kDa was abolished in mice depleted ofCD4, but not of CD8 (Fig. 5).  These results suggest thatCD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells, play an important rolein the killing mechanism associated with BCGimmunotherapy.DiscussionBCG is an important clinical tool because of its pro-found immunostimulatory properties, as it can preventtuberculosis and eradicate high-risk superficial bladdercancer.  The presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) in theurinary bladder had required total cystectomy, since CISfrequently progresses to invasive bladder cancer.  BCGinstillation therapy is believed to be the most successfulimmunotherapy against cancer because 70% of CISpatients can be cured without cystectomy (25).  BCGinstillation therapy also works well against T1b grade 3bladder cancer, which is thought to have high malignantpotential (11).  However, some patients are refractory toBCG therapy and still require total cystectomy (9).  Toimprove the efficiency of BCG against bladder cancer, theexact mechanism of its anti-tumor effect must be clari-fied.  Here, we focused on the 65 kDa heat shock proteinof mycobacteria, which can elicit powerful humoral andcellular immune responses.  We reported that BCGinstillation therapy raises a serum antibody against the 65kDa protein (6), indicating that this protein plays animportant role in BCG immunotherapy.A wide range of mycobacterial species express the 65kDa protein (2, 28).  This antigen contains epitopes thatare species-specific and those that are common to variousspecies of mycobacteria.  Identity has been demonstrat-ed between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and BCG 65kDa protein (21).  The 65 kDa antigen has several fea-tures.  The immune response to the BCG 65 kDa proteinis involved in adjuvant arthritis in rats (26).  Moreover, Tcells from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoidarthritis can recognize the 65 kDa protein (1).  Thus, thisprotein plays an important role in autoimmune disease.The 65 kDa protein is one of the heat shock proteins(hsp) induced by various types of stress to protect cellsfrom environmental damage (22).  Many hsp are alsoessential for cellular function under normal conditionsand they can also function as molecular chaperones tofold and transport proteins.We aimed to introduce the mycobacterial 65 kDa293IMMUNO-GENE THERAPY USING MYCOBACTERIAL MAJOR ANTIGENFig. 5. Growth of tumor ascites in mice immunized with BCG (B16/65kDa\ufffdBCG) and then intraperitoneally injected with 5\ufffd106B16/65kDa cells. Formation of tumor ascites was examined 3 times each week and the percentage of ascites free mice was calculated.Y axis: percentage of ascites free mice. X axis: days after injection of tumor cells. To elucidate the anti-tumor mechanism, the same exper-iments were performed in mice depleted of CD4 (B16/65kDa\ufffdBCG CD4 (\ufffd)), or CD8 (B16/65kDa\ufffdBCG CD8 (\ufffd)). Controlcurves show formation of tumor ascites in non-immunized mice intraperitoneally injected with 5\ufffd106 B16 cells.antigen to tumor cells to increase their immunogenicity.The tumor growth of B16 (B16/65kDa) cells transfectedwith the 65 kDa gene was slightly retarded comparedwith parental B16 cells in naive mice.  Moreover, intro-duction of the 65 kDa gene remarkably enhanced theanti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy.  We believethat this strategy represents a breakthrough for BCGimmune therapy for bladder cancer.  Lukacs et al. orig-inally reported the possibility of immune gene therapyusing mycobacterial 65 kDa hsp (14).  They introducedthe 65 kDa hsp of Mycobacterium leprae to murinemacrophage tumor cell lines (J774).  The transfectedcell line (J774-hsp65) was totally abrogated when inject-ed into syngeneic Balb/c mice.  This anti-tumor effectwas also evident in athymic nude mice, indicating that theanti-tumor property of J774-hsp65 does not require Tcells.  Mice injected with J774-hsp65 resisted subse-quent challenge with parental J774.  On the contrary, bothCD4 and CD8 T cells were essential for this acquiredimmunity.  Lukacs also described in vivo gene therapyusing liposome-mediated transfection with the sameantigen (15).  Kuromatsu et al.  introduced the \u03b1 antigenof Mycobacterium kansasii into a mouse bladder cancercell line (13).  The transfected cell lines were rejected inmice primed and unprimed with BCG.  That studyproved the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)epitope-specific CD8 CTLs.  The \u03b1 antigen is a differentprotein from the 65 kDa hsp.  However, both are highlyimmunogenic mycobacterial antigens that can elicit apowerful anti-tumor effect when expressed by tumorcells.Our findings were somewhat different from those ofLukacs.  The anti-tumor effect in our model was not aspowerful as theirs, since the immunogenic propertiesof B16 and J774 are quite different.  B16 is a tumor cellline with low immunogenicity.  J774 is a macrophagetumor cell line that can present antigen, which might beassociated with its powerful anti-tumor effect.  Of inter-est is the effector cells in each model.  J774 does notrequire T cells to reject tumors whereas the main effec-tors in BCG therapy against B16/65kDa were CD4 Tcells.  Shinomiya et al.  also showed Th1 type CD4\ufffd Tcell clone, which was capable of recognizing purifiedprotein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,had anti-metastatic activity against melanoma.  Thisclone could secrete IFN\u03b3, TNF and interleukin-2 whichstimulated NK cell activity (23).  Considering that CD4T cells are powerfully stimulated by mycobacterial infec-tion, humoral mediators such as interferon and TNFmay play an important role in the killing mechanismof BCG immunotherapy.In this paper, we successfully showed that the intro-duction of 65 kDa hsp gene enhanced BCG immunother-apy.  The next step is to establish the effective method tointroduce the gene into bladder cancer for clinical set-tings.  Several papers reported the gene introduction byinstillation therapy with adenovirus or liposome (10,12, 20).  Pagliaro et al. reported a phase I study of p53gene therapy for patients with locally advanced bladdercancer and showed evidence or tumor response (19).In the future, we will try to establish instillation therapycombined with BCG and 65 kDa gene to improve thecurrent BCG therapy.In conclusion, expression of the 65 kDa mycobacter-ial hsp specifically enhanced the anti-tumor effect ofBCG therapy against a malignant melanoma cell linewith low immunogenicity.  In addition, CD4 T cells butnot CD8 T cells are involved in this mechanism.References1) Gaston, J.S., Life, P.F., Jenner, P.J., Colston, M.J., andBacon, P.A. 1990.
