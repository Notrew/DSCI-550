Chapple,1 and Neil Hunter1Institute of Dental Research, Westmead Millennium Institute and Centre for Oral Health, Westmead Hospital, Sydney,New South Wales, Australia,1 and NSU Dental, Nova Southeastern University, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida2Received 13 September 2004/Returned for modification 26 October 2004/Accepted 8 November 2004Periodontitis is a response of highly vascularized tissues to the adjacent microflora of dental plaque.Progressive disease has been related to consortia of anaerobic bacteria, with the gram-negative organismPorphyromonas gingivalis particularly implicated. The gingipains, comprising a group of cysteine proteinasesand associated hemagglutinin domains, are major virulence determinants of this organism. As vascularexpression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is a critical determinant of tissue response to microbial challenge,the objective of this study was to determine the capacity of gingipains to modulate the expression and functionof these receptors. Given the potential multifunctional role of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1(PECAM-1) in the vasculature, the effect of gingipains on PECAM-1 expression by endothelial cells wasexamined. Activated gingipains preferentially down-regulated PECAM-1 expression on endothelial cells com-pared with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, but the reductionin PECAM-1 expression was completely inhibited in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor TLCK(N\ufffd-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Endothelial monolayers treated with activated gingipains demon-strated progressive intercellular gap formation that correlated with reduced intercellular junctional PECAM-1expression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. This was accompanied byenhanced transfer of both albumin and neutrophils across the monolayer. The results suggest that degradationof PECAM-1 by gingipains contributes to increased vascular permeability and neutrophil flux at disease sites.Periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases af-fecting the well-vascularized connective tissues of the peri-odontium (20). Microbial challenge at the gingival sulcus leadsto an inflammatory response in the adjacent soft tissues that ischaracterized by a migration of leukocytes from postcapillaryvenules into the extravascular tissue. It has been shown that thenumerical density of vascular profiles in the connective tissueincreases significantly subjacent to the altered epithelial liningof the periodontal pocket (11). Characteristic endothelial celladhesion molecule expression related to leukocyte infiltrationof human gingiva has been demonstrated (38, 44).Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a majoretiological agent in the onset and progression of chronic peri-odontitis (59). The trypsin-like cysteine proteinases or gingi-pains (Arg-gingipain, encoded by the two genes rgpA and rgpB,and a Lys-specific gingipain encoded by a single gene, kgp)have been closely linked with the virulence of this gram-neg-ative anaerobic bacteria (28, 31, 36). The outer membrane-associated gingipains (RgpA and Kgp) extracted from P. gin-givalis ATCC 33277 contain a catalytic domain and ahemagglutinin/adhesin domain (54, 70). Cysteine proteinaseactivities may affect cytokine inactivation and degradation (69,70), acquisition of metabolically necessary iron and porphyrinfrom hemoglobin (14), enhancement of vascular permeabilitythrough plasma prekallikrein activation and bradykinin release(33), and degradation of epithelial cell-cell junctional com-plexes (37).Leukocyte emigration from the bloodstream into tissues atsites of inflammation is controlled by sequential intercellularadhesion events with endothelial cells that line the vascularwall. The initial rolling and tethering steps are mediated bymembers of the selectin family including endothelial leukocyteadhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1 or E-selectin) and L-selectin(4, 8, 60). Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) andintercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), located onthe surface of cytokine-activated endothelium, belong to theimmunoglobulin supergene family and are considered to beinvolved in the next step of leukocyte-endothelium interaction,where a tighter adhesion takes place (5, 51). Gemmell et al.found that endothelial cells did not express ELAM-1 in chron-ically inflamed periodontal tissue (27). Other studies have in-dicated that ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 can be detectedon endothelial cells adjacent to the junctional epithelium earlyin the course of experimentally induced gingivitis (44, 50, 65),suggesting that they are involved in crucial processes whichdirect leukocyte migration into the tissues and toward thegingival sulcus. Further, ICAM-1 on oral epithelial cells hasrecently been shown to be susceptible to proteolysis by gingi-pains (63). The importance of cell adhesion molecules is high-lighted by the rapid and severe periodontitis that characterizesleukocyte adhesion deficiency where polymorphonuclear leu-kocytes (PMNs) are unable to migrate through the endothe-lium of gingival blood vessels (22).Leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is followed by leu-* Corresponding author.

Studies have shown a role for PECAM-1 in inter-endothelial adhesion (16) and leukocyte-endothelial cell inter-actions (6). Muller et al. (45, 46) were the first to show thatpretreating monocytes or neutrophils with antibodies specificfor PECAM-1 inhibited their emigration across an endothelialcell monolayer in a quantitative in vitro assay of transendothe-lial migration. Other studies have also demonstrated an abnor-mal transit of polymorphonuclear leukocytes across vascularbasement membranes in PECAM-1-deficient mice (19, 64).PECAM-1 has also been implicated in vascular responses inwound healing, angiogenesis (15, 25), and the development ofthe early cardiovascular system (2). Investigation of culturedPECAM-1-deficient endothelial cells has provided confirma-tory evidence that PECAM-1 has an important function in themaintenance of a vascular permeability barrier (24). In thelesions of gingivitis and periodontitis, the expression ofPECAM-1 on mononuclear infiltrates increases significantlywith increasing size of infiltrate (27). Although these studiesimplicate cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of peri-odontal disease, the ability of gingipains from P. gingivalis tointeract with these molecules has not been previously exam-ined.In this study we report that the gingipains adhere to humanumbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rapidly de-grade PECAM-1 at endothelial cell lateral junctions to inducethe formation of intercellular gaps. In contrast, tumor necrosisfactor \ufffd (TNF-\ufffd)-induced VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 expressionon HUVECs is minimally affected by gingipains. Evidence ispresented to show that loss of PECAM-1 on HUVECs canfacilitate neutrophil transmigration in vitro. Hence, gingipainsof P. gingivalis may contribute to the vascular disruption ofperiodontal tissue and facilitate leukocyte extravasation intothe site.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and reagents.

Calcein-AM and Alexa Fluor 488 werepurchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). All reagents for electro-phoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, Calif.).Recombinant cytokines and antibodies. Human recombinant TNF-\ufffd was ob-tained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). Mouse monoclonal antibodies(MAb) specific for human CD31 (PECAM-1), CD62E (ELAM-1), and CD106 orVCAM-1 (MAb 51-10C9) were purchased from Becton Dickinson Inc. (Heidel-berg, Germany). A blocking antibody to PECAM-1 (clone HEC7) was alsopurchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, N.J.). MAb IIB2 was raisedin mice against gingipains as previously described (14). IIB2 recognizes thehemagglutinin/adhesin domains, HA1 and HA3, of RgpA and Kgp (39 kDa)from P. gingivalis.Bacterial strain and proteinase purification. P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277) wasgrown in enriched Trypticase soy broth under anaerobic conditions for 48 h.Organisms at a density of 1.5 gm/cm3 were suspended in saline, stirred for 1 h at4\u00b0C, washed three times with pyrogen-free water, and lyophilized. Arg-gingipainand Lys-gingipain proteinase-adhesin complexes were purified according to themethod previously described (70). Purified gingipains were dialyzed against fivechanges of PBS with 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5.Binding of gingipains to endothelial cells. HUVECs were isolated by collage-nase treatment of the vessels as described elsewhere (35). Endothelial cells wereseeded in 1% gelatin-coated 12-well plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, Mass.)in M199 medium supplemented with 30 \ufffdg of endothelial cell growth factor perml and containing 20% FCS, 10 U of heparin per ml, 50 U of penicillin ml, and50 \ufffdg of streptomycin per ml. Cells used in these experiments were confluent andat passage levels four through six. Before the experiment, FCS was withheld, andthe cells were cultured in M199 medium. Confluent endothelial cell monolayerswere then treated with 5 mM cysteine-activated RgpA and Kgp at concentrationsof 210 to 0.9 nM (1:3 serial dilution) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. In serum experiments, cellmonolayers were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 to 40% FCS or 2mM TLCK (dialyzed against PBS and cultured in the absence of serum) for 1 hat 37\u00b0C. HUVECs were also tested in the presence or absence of the indicatedconcentrations of cysteine added to the gingipains. After the incubations, cellswere harvested by gentle scraping and washed three times with 2 ml of PBS,stained with mouse IIB2 MAb, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conju-gated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Dako, Sydney, Australia), andthe relative labeling of the cell population was quantified in a Becton DickinsonFACScan analyzer. Isotype-matched IgG1 (Dako) was used as a control.Evaluation of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs. Confluent HUVECs wereincubated with a 5 mM concentration of cysteine-activated RgpA or Kgp atconcentrations of 70, 23, or 7.8 nM at 37\u00b0C without serum and harvested byscraping at 15-min intervals for up to 1 h. Gingipain-treated HUVECs weresimilarly cultured in the presence or absence of 5, 10, and 20% FCS or 2 mMTLCK for 1 h. Endothelial cells were then washed twice with cold PBS\u20130.1%bovine serum albumin\u20130.01% NaN3 and stained with the corresponding primarymouse anti-human MAbs (1:50) against PECAM-1 or with matched isotypecontrol antibody. Cells were then labeled with a 1:100 concentration of fluores-cein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and quantitated byusing a Becton Dickinson FACScan analyzer. Incubations were for 50 min at 4\u00b0Cfor each stage. Volume gates were set to include the entire HUVEC population.Data were collected as histograms of relative fluorescence in a logarithmic scaleon the x axis, with cell number as a linear scale on the y axis. To assess the effectof fixation on PECAM-1 expression, HUVECs were fixed in 3% paraformalde-hyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Fixedor unfixed endothelial cells were then incubated with activated gingipains (70 nMeach) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C without serum. After the incubation, HUVECs werewashed, stained for surface PECAM-1, and analyzed by flow cytometry.Western blot analysis of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs after gingipainstreatment. Confluent HUVECs grown on 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates(Corning Costar) were cultured with activated RgpA or Kgp (70 nM each) forvarious times at 37\u00b0C in the absence of serum. After incubation, reactions werestopped with 2 mM TLCK, and HUVECs were isolated by gently scraping.HUVECs were also treated with 2 mM TLCK-treated gingipains for 1 h withoutserum. Endothelial cells were then washed twice with 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.5) and mixed with 20% (vol/vol) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Endothe-lial cells were then lysed directly in SDS reducing sample buffer by three cyclesof heat (100\u00b0C for 3 min) and vigorous mixing. Aliquots were then resolved bySDS\u201310% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39) and transferred to polyvinyli-dene difluoride membranes (66). The primary antibody, mouse anti-humanPECAM-1 MAb, was diluted 1:500 in 5% nonfat dry milk\u2013Tris-buffered-salinebefore use. Alkaline phosphatase rabbit anti-mouse (Dako), diluted 1:5,000, wasused as the secondary antibody. Membranes were washed five times in Tris-buffered saline\u20130.1% Tween 20 between each step. Color was developed in asolution containing nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (1.65 mg) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (0.8 mg) in 10 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl(pH 9.5).Endothelial cell permeability assay. The permeability of HUVEC monolayersto Evans Blue albumin (EBA; 0.67 mg Evans Blue dye/ml and 4% bovine serumalbumin in M199 medium), as a measure of gap junctional area, was determinedas previously described (52). HUVEC monolayers were grown to confluence ontissue culture-treated transwells (3-\ufffdm pore size; 12-mm diameter) (CorningCostar) in 24-well microtiter plates. The upper transwell and lower culture platewells were filled with M199 medium (50 and 500 \ufffdl, respectively). For treatmentof the monolayers, the transwells were washed with M199 medium without serumand then treated for 30 min with 5 mM cysteine-activated or TLCK-inhibitedVOL. 73, 2005 HYDROLYSIS OF PECAM-1 BY GINGIPAINS 1387gingipains (70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp) or with the cysteine buffercontrol. After treatment, the transwells were again washed three times withmedium; 500 \ufffdl of medium from the bottom well was collected for analysis andreplaced at times 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, and 50 \ufffdl of fresh EBA was replacedin the transwell at the same time intervals. All samples were diluted 1:1 in M199medium, and mean optical density at 630 nm was evaluated by spectrophotom-etry. EBA standards were used to create a calibration curve of optical densityversus milligrams of albumin per milliliter. The diffusion of EBA from theluminal buffer in the transwell to the abluminal buffer in the lower well wasexpressed as milligrams of albumin/minute/centimeter2 of monolayer.PMN transmigration assay. Human PMNs were isolated by Ficoll gradientseparation (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, Calif.), followed by hypotonic red celllysis. For the visualization of transmigrating cells, PMNs were fluorescentlylabeled with the membrane-associated dye calcein-AM (10 \ufffdM) (47) (MolecularProbes) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with occasional shaking. After two washes in completeRPMI medium, cells were adjusted to a density of 106 cells/ml and resuspendedin culture medium at 37\u00b0C. HUVECs were plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coatedtranswells (3-\ufffdm pore size; 12-mm diameter) (Corning Costar) in 24-well mi-crotiter plates for 2 to 3 days. PMN transmigration was also evaluated withTNF-\ufffd (10 ng/ml)-induced HUVECs for 4 h. Before the experiment, mediumM199 in upper and lower chambers was replaced with serum-free medium.Confluent HUVECs were then incubated with 5 mM cysteine-activated gingi-pains (a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp) in the presence or absence of 2mM TLCK, 10 \ufffdg of anti-CD31 MAb (clone HEC7) or isotype-matched controlper ml, or with control medium for 30 min, after which the transwells were againwashed gently three times with M199 medium. To create a chemotactic gradientfor neutrophils, fMLP (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) (23) at a concentration of 1 \ufffdMwas added to the lower compartments of the transwell units. Calcein-AM labeledneutrophils were added to the upper chamber at a density of 106 cells/well. Atdifferent time points (1 or 2 h), transmigrated PMNs were recovered from thelower compartment, and the fluorescence of the samples was measured by aPerkin Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 488 nmand an emission wavelength of 535 nm.Immunofluorescence staining. HUVECs for immunofluorescence assays weregrown on 1% gelatin-coated eight-well chamber culture slides (Lab-Tek, SanDiego, Calif.) until a confluent monolayer was achieved. Endothelial cells werethen cultured with activated RgpA (70 nM) for 15 and 30 min at 37\u00b0C in theabsence of serum. HUVECs were also treated with 2 mM TLCK-treated RgpAfor 30 min without serum. After exposure to experimental conditions, cells werewashed in PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing,the slide was stained with primary antibody against anti-PECAM-1 for 45 min,unbound primary antibody was washed away, and cells were labeled with AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated secondary antibody for another 45 minat room temperature. After washing, the slide was mounted and analyzed with aZeiss fluorescence microscope (Thornwood, N.Y.) connected to a Nikon digitalcamera (Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysis. All data were expressed as means \ufffd standard error of themeans (SEM). Differences between groups were examined for statistical signif-icance by using a Student\u2019s t test for unpaired data and a paired t test for paireddata. A P value of \ufffd0.05 indicated the presence of a statistically significantdifference.RESULTSEffect of serum, cysteine, and proteinase inhibitors on bind-ing of gingipains to HUVECs. The ability of gingipains to bindto HUVECs was examined by flow cytometry after a 1-h incu-bation. Figure 1A shows that, under serum-free conditions, thebinding of activated RgpA or Kgp to HUVECs occurred in adose-dependent manner. Both RgpA and Kgp exhibited simi-lar binding activity to HUVECs, with 50% binding at approx-imately 2.7 nM and maximal effect near 70 nM. As serum is arich source of proteinase inhibitors (30, 67), the effect of serumon gingipain binding to HUVECs was examined. The bindingof a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp to HUVECs wasonly slightly affected by incubation in the presence of serum upto 40% (Fig. 1B). Further, the addition of 2 mM TLCK, aninhibitor of RgpA and Kgp, did not reduce binding, demon-strating that cysteine proteinase activity was not required (Fig.1B). Figures 1C and D demonstrate the fluorescence-activatedcell sorter (FACS) profiles of 70 nM RgpA and 70 nM Kgpbound to HUVECs after 1 h of incubation in the presence of20% FCS. As cysteine is known as an effective reducing agentfor the activation of gingipains, we tested the effect of variouslevels of cysteine on the binding activity of 70 nM gingipains toHUVECs. The amount of cysteine had little effect on bindingas \ufffd80% of maximal gingipain binding to HUVECs wasachieved without activation (Fig. 1E). The results suggest thatthe adhesin domains of the gingipains are able to bind toHUVECs and that proteolytic activity of the gingipains is notcritical in this process.Reduction of PECAM-1 on HUVECs by gingipains. PECAM-1molecules are constitutively expressed on endothelial cells(49). We first investigated the ability of purified RgpA and Kgpto affect the expression of PECAM-1 by HUVECs under se-rum-free conditions. Both RgpA and Kgp efficiently reducedPECAM-1 expression on HUVECs in a time- and dose-depen-dent manner (Fig. 2A, B). Treatment of the HUVECs with a70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp for 15 min reduceddetection of PECAM-1 from 90% to approximately 25%(RgpA) and 40% (Kgp) of positive cells. Figures 2C and Ddemonstrate the FACS profiles of PECAM-1 expression onHUVECs after the addition of the indicated levels of gingi-pains for 1 h. To further identify PECAM-1 expression onHUVEC surfaces after gingipain treatment, a time coursestudy was followed by Western blotting with the anti-PE-CAM-1 MAb (Fig. 2E). In untreated HUVECs, there was a130-kDa band corresponding to intact PECAM-1. After a 15-min incubation with either RgpA or Kgp at 70 nM, the 130-kDa band representing the PECAM-1 was reduced. The 130-kDa PECAM-1 band disappeared after a 30- or 60-mintreatment with RgpA or Kgp, respectively. To verify that thegingipains are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of sur-face PECAM-1 on HUVECs, the proteinase inhibitor TLCKwas incubated with gingipains before being added to theHUVECs. Under these conditions, the intensity of the 130-kDa PECAM-1 band was unaffected after a 60-min treatmentwith TLCK-treated RgpA or Kgp. The results correlated wellwith the flow cytometric analysis and confirmed that the re-duction of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs was due toproteolysis by gingipains.Extracellular enzymatic digestion of PECAM-1 by gingi-pains on HUVECs. The reduction of surface PECAM mole-cules on HUVECs was due to the enzymatic activity of gingi-pains since the cysteine proteinase inhibitor TLCK (at 2 mM)blocked the effect completely (Fig. 3A). Further, gingipainseffectively diminished PECAM-1 expression by \ufffd30% in thepresence of 10% FCS. The capacity of the gingipains to reducePECAM-1 expression was fully suppressed in the presence of20% serum.To determine whether the reduction in PECAM-1 expres-sion may reflect either shedding or internalization of theseadhesion glycoproteins (32) rather than proteolytic cleavage bygingipains, HUVECs were fixed before gingipain treatment.As shown in Fig. 3B, both RgpA and Kgp down-regulatedPECAM-1 expression on both fixed and unfixed HUVECs (P\ufffd 0.001). Taken together, these data demonstrated adhesin-mediated binding of gingipains to endothelial cells and signif-1388 YUN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.FIG. 1. Binding of gingipains to HUVECs.

We directlycompared the effects of gingipains on VCAM-1 and ELAM-1expression to the effects observed for PECAM-1. TNF-\ufffd-acti-vated HUVECs were incubated for 1 to 3 h in the presence orabsence of 70 nM gingipain under serum-free conditions (Fig.4A). The percentage of cells expressing VCAM-1 and ELAM-1was slightly decreased by approximately 10 to 15% after 1 to2 h of treatment with RgpA or Kgp compared to the untreatedHUVEC cultures. VCAM-1 expression on HUVECs was de-creased by a further 5 to 10% after 3 h of treatment withgingipains. Expression of ELAM-1 was significantly (P \ufffd0.001) reduced by approximately 40% at 3 h in RgpA-treatedHUVEC cultures compared with untreated HUVECs. How-ever, when 20% FCS was added to the gingipain-treatedHUVEC cultures for 1 to 3 h, no reduction of the VCAM-1and ELAM-1 expression levels on HUVECs was observed,which is similar to serum effects on PECAM-1 proteolysis bygingipains (data not shown).The reduction of PECAM-1 expression on PMNs by gingi-pains. As PECAM-1 is also expressed on neutrophils (48), weexamined the effects of gingipain treatment on PMN PECAM-1expression. Under serum-free conditions, treatment of neutro-phils with a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp significantly(P \ufffd 0.001) reduced PECAM-1 surface expression by approx-imately 90% after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 4B). Further, thereduction of PECAM-1 expression was completely blocked bythe RgpA and Kgp inhibitor TLCK.Vascular permeability is increased following treatment withgingipains in vitro. To demonstrate the effect of gingipains onHUVEC contraction and intercellular gap formation, pho-tomicrographs were taken, and monolayer permeability toEBA was recorded (52). Photographs taken at 0, 15, and 60min after exposure to a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgpshowed a rapid and obvious contraction of endothelial cellsand gradual intercellular gap formation (Fig. 5A). In contrast,a 60-min exposure to TLCK-treated RgpA or Kgp resulted inneither endothelial cell contraction nor intercellular gap for-mation, as seen by comparing photographs with those taken ofuntreated HUVECs (Fig. 5A). Gingipains also induced aprompt increase in the permeability of monolayers to EBA.Buffer treatment was used as a negative control. Figure 5Bshows that the same conditions resulted in a two- to threefoldincrease in EBA permeability within 10 min. Endothelialmonolayer permeability increased with time after the additionof gingipains, and there was no change induced by TLCK-inhibited gingipains or buffer treatment. These visual and per-meability data confirm that gingipains induced intercellulargap formation.Gingipains enhance transmigration of PMNs acrossHUVEC monolayers. The modification of permeability wasquantified by establishing the transmigration time course ofPMNs across endothelial cell monolayers seeded on poroustranswell chambers. Prior to the addition of PMNs to theupper compartments of the transwell units, endothelial cellmonolayers underwent treatment with gingipains at a concen-tration of 70 nM or with proteolytically inhibited gingipains forFIG. 3. Serum inhibition of proteolysis of PECAM-1 by gingipains.

Similarly, in TNF-\ufffd-activatedHUVEC monolayers, gingipain treatment allowed morePMNs to transmigrate (Fig. 6B). Inhibition of gingipains byTLCK significantly blocked the enhancement of PMN trans-migration. The results correlated with the finding that gingi-pains can disrupt interendothelial cell junctions and increasevascular permeability.PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs is diminished in re-sponse to RgpA treatment. To examine whether the transmi-gration of PMNs across HUVEC monolayers, facilitated bychallenge with RgpA, was associated with changes in the dis-tribution of PECAM-1 at interendothelial junctions, confluentHUVEC monolayers were incubated with either RgpA or con-trol medium, and the distribution of PECAM-1 was analyzedby fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7, unstimulatedconfluent cells were brightly stained for PECAM-1 moleculesthat showed a linear and homogeneous distribution at cellborders (Fig. 7). Conversely, staining for PECAM-1 was lessFIG. 4. Time course of the effect of gingipains on PECAM-1, VCAM-1, and ELAM-1 expression on HUVECs.

HUVECs stimulated withTLCK-treated RgpA exhibited a pattern of reactivity that wassimilar to that of the control cells, with no overt changes in thestaining and distribution of PECAM-1.DISCUSSIONPrevious reports have implied that P. gingivalis may pene-trate the epithelial barrier surrounding the gingival sulcus (18).Further, P. gingivalis has been observed within gingival tissuesin vivo (55), whereas tissue penetration and destruction by P.gingivalis have been demonstrated in vitro (1). These resultsindicated that P. gingivalis may invade deeper structures of theconnective tissue. Likewise, it has been reported that P. gingi-valis can adhere to and invade endothelial cells (17). Also, it isinteresting that P. gingivalis has been detected in atheroscle-rotic plaques (13). The present study indicates the role ofgingipains in the ability of P. gingivalis to localize to endothelialcells. The results suggest that gingipains are likely to adhere toendothelial cells in vivo, as serum concentrations up to 40%have little affect on binding activity. We speculate that theability of gingipains to adhere to endothelial cells may contrib-ute not only to localized inflammation but also, through enter-ing the bloodstream, to the development of systemic reactionssuch as atherosclerosis (3). The data also suggest that adher-FIG. 5. Photomicrographs and EBA permeability of HUVEC monolayers after treatment with gingipain.

The lack of PECAM-1 cleavage following pre-treatment of gingipains with TLCK, a cysteine protease inhib-itor that inhibits gingipain activity, strongly supports the find-ings.Both RgpA and Kgp were shown to efficiently degradePECAM-1 on endothelial cells. We observed that thresholdlevels of gingipains were required for degradation ofFIG. 6. Time course of neutrophil transmigration through gingipain-treated HUVEC monolayers. Confluent endothelial cell monolayers wereseeded on porous transwell filters in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 10 ng of TNF-\ufffd per ml for 4 h. The wells were then rinsed twice, anduntreated HUVECs were used for comparison. Endothelial cells were then treated either with activated gingipain (70 nM) in the presence orabsence of 2 mM TLCK (TL), with anti-PECAM-1 antibody (clone HEC7 at a concentration of 10 \ufffdg/ml), or with isotype-matched antibody for30 min without serum. Anti-VCAM-1 antibody (10 \ufffdg/ml) was also added as a control for the TNF-\ufffd-activated HUVECs. Monolayers (top wells)were concurrently washed gently in culture medium; 1 \ufffdM fMLP was added to the lower wells as a stimulant after the addition of calcein-AMlabeled PMNs (106/well) to the upper compartments of the transwell units.

IMMUN.PECAM-1 to occur. PECAM-1 is a single chain 130-kDa mem-brane glycoprotein containing six extracellular Ig-like domainsof the C2 subclass, one transmembrane region, and a cytoplas-mic tail (48). A recent study with chimeric constructs of humanPECAM-1 revealed that homophilic binding of PECAM-1 onadjacent cells and positively charged sequences (599RKAKAK604) in the juxtamembrane region of the transmembrane do-main of PECAM-1 are important for its localization to cell-cellborders (62). In this context, the hemagglutinin domains havebeen reported to regulate intracellular dispersion of gingipainstaken up by epithelial cells (57), and the proteinases havespecificity for arginine and lysine residues (54), with the 599RKAKAK604 sequence a potential target.The major proteinase inhibitors present in human serum arealpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin (\ufffd2M). Two strains of P. gingivalis (W83 andH185) have been shown to degrade most serum proteins, in-cluding the plasma proteinase inhibitors alpha-1-antitrypsinand \ufffd2M, but not alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (10). In anotherstudy, \ufffd2M was shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of gingi-pain R efficiently but not gingipain K (30). While the serumprotease inhibitors may limit PECAM-1 cleavage onHUVECs, the actual effect remains undetermined in thepresent study. The observed effect of serum in limiting down-regulation of PECAM-1 on HUVECs could be attributed toserum albumin, a known preferred target of gingipain activity(29), acting as a competitive substrate, resulting in increasedretention of PECAM-1. The present report indicates thatgingipains at a concentration of 70 nM effectively reducePECAM-1 expression on HUVECs in the presence of 10%serum, whereas limited hydrolysis of PECAM-1 was observedin the presence of 20% serum. The level of gingipains increvicular fluid at inflamed sites was estimated at 40 to 90 nM(21), comparable to the amount used in this study. Hence, it ispossible that proteolytic cleavage of PECAM-1 by gingipainsoccurs in vivo.The present study shows that gingipains are able to increasethe permeability of endothelial monolayers. The kinetics ofendothelial permeability induced by gingipains correlated withthe kinetics of PECAM-1 degradation. It can therefore bepresumed that treatment of endothelial monolayers with gin-gipains disrupts intercellular junctions, at least by degradationof the PECAM-1 involved in endothelial monolayer integrity.Gap formation by gingipains appears to be different fromTNF-\ufffd-promoted intercellular gap formation, where actin pe-ripheral bundles are converted into stress fibers and whereFIG. 7. Immunofluorescence showing intercellular PECAM-1 staining on HUVECs treated with gingipains. HUVECs were grown to conflu-ence in an eight-well chamber culture slide and incubated with 70 nM RgpA for 15 and 30 min or with control medium alone. HUVECs were alsotreated with 2 mM TLCK-treated RgpA (RgpTL) at a concentration of 70 nM for 30 min. Cells were then stained with anti-PECAM-1 MAbfollowed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were imaged by using conventional fluorescence microscopy and a digital camera.Note the decrease of intercellular PECAM-1 staining in the gingipain-treated HUVECs and the normal distribution of PECAM-1 in HUVECs.VOL. 73, 2005 HYDROLYSIS OF PECAM-1 BY GINGIPAINS 1395increased permeability to macromolecules is observed (7).Changes in endothelial cell intercellular permeability by gingi-pains occur in parallel with changes in the rate of leukocytetransmigration. We conclude that reduced PECAM-1 expres-sion at the junctions after gingipains treatment may disrupt thetight assembly of endothelial cells, thus allowing leukocytetransmigration in this system.Evidence was obtained that gingipains did not preferentiallydegrade ELAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressed by endothelial cellscompared with PECAM-1. RgpA reduced half of the TNF-\ufffd-induced ELAM-1 expression on endothelial cells after 3 h ofincubation, reflecting the limited activity of RgpA in degrada-tion of ELAM-1. ELAM-1 binds neutrophils selectively but notthe majority of lymphocytes (5). It has been suggested thatgingival blood vessels might be functionally specialized to con-stitutively express ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 and thus facilitateleukocyte traffic into the gingival crevice (44). The presentinvestigation indicated that prolonged exposure to gingipainsproduced by P. gingivalis might modify the rolling or tetheringsteps of leukocytes mediated by ELAM-1 expression on endo-thelial cells.It has been reported that two regions of VCAM-1, localizedto domains 4 and 5, are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage byendopeptidase Glu-C of Staphylococcus aureus (53). However,gingipains exhibit minimal activity against TNF-\ufffd-inducedVCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells in vitro. VCAM-1 is aselective adhesion molecule for mononuclear cells (9). Theresistance of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells to gingipains sug-gests a functional involvement of this molecule during adhe-sion and transendothelial migration of lymphocytes in peri-odontitis. Our results indicate that PMN transmigration acrosscytokine-activated endothelial cells can be facilitated by gingi-pains and may potentially contribute to leukocyte accumula-tion at periodontal sites.The expression of PECAM-1 on PMNs could play an im-portant role in the modulation of inflammatory foci by influ-encing responses to chemotaxis, cell adhesion, or mediators ofinflammation such as cytokines and complement (46). Also,the transendothelial migration of leukocytes across the suben-dothelial basal lamina is mediated via the heterophilic inter-action of domain 6 of leukocyte PECAM-1 with unknowncomponent(s) of the basement membrane (41, 46). We ob-served that gingipains can also down-regulate PECAM-1 ex-pression on PMNs. The data suggest the potential ability ofgingipains to reduce the heterophilic interaction of leukocytePECAM-1 with endothelial cells at sites of inflammatory gin-gival tissue.Gingipain-K has potent fibrinogenolytic activity that cancontribute to a bleeding tendency at periodontitis sites (34).On the other hand, a recent study has demonstrated prolongedbleeding times in PECAM-1-deficient mice (42). These studiesare consistent with a role for gingipains in the acquisition ofthe iron or porphyrin necessary for bacterial growth and viru-lence (14), potentially mediated by modulating endothelial cellPECAM-1 expression and extending bleeding time.Leukocyte transmigration through the endothelium is a mul-tistep process. PECAM-1 is an important component at endo-thelial junctions. However, three additional adhesive proteins,junctional adhesion molecule (40, 43), CD99 (56) and vascularendothelial-cadherin (61), expressed at endothelial cell-celljunctions, have recently been demonstrated to be involved inleukocyte transmigration. To date, only the epithelial-cadherinand neuronal-cadherin of epithelial cells are known to be de-graded by P. gingivalis proteases (12). Further investigation isunder way to resolve a possible interaction of gingipains andthese adhesion proteins.The creation of intercellular gaps and the relative sparing ofadhesion receptors important in anchoring mononuclear leu-kocytes is noteworthy in relation to the pathology of the lesion.P. gingivalis infection can cause local inflammation, which con-tributes to the ulceration of the gingiva and local vascularchanges. The observed expression of endothelial ELAM-1 andVCAM-1 under P. gingivalis proteinase challenge is consistentwith the initial stages of gingival inflammation characterized bythe continuous migration of leukocytes (44, 50, 65). Further,the present investigation indicates that gingipains from P. gin-givalis may contribute to the initiation of endothelial barrierdestruction by cleaving PECAM-1 at the endothelial cell-celljunction. P. gingivalis and the gingipains may interact withendothelium of the microvasculature from the perivascularaspect, along a gradient from the plaque mass in the periodon-tal pocket to the adjacent connective tissues. Equally likely,gingipains may enter the vasculature through localized sites ofmicroulceration of the pocket wall, interacting with endothe-lium from the lumenal aspect. Consequently, gingipains canpromote microvascular permeability and could potentially con-tribute to gingival crevicular flooding and leukocyte accumu-lation at periodontal sites infected with P. gingivalis. Of rele-vance also is the observed correlation between the occurrenceof P. gingivalis and neutrophil elastase levels in the gingivalcrevicular fluid at periodontitis sites (71). While the recruit-ment of leukocytes and participation of inflammatory media-tors such as proinflammatory cytokines may amplify the mag-nitude of tissue and vascular damage at periodontitis sites,these inflammatory products can also enter the circulation toproduce systemic effects. Significantly, P. gingivalis proteinasesmay overcome host immune responses by effectively down-regulating both afferent and efferent arms of the cell-mediatedimmune response (69, 70). Further, gingipains are effective instimulating polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes (68), anobservation compatible with the observed perivascular accu-mulation of degenerate B-cell derivatives as a characteristicfeature of the lesion of periodontitis (26, 58). Conversely, me-diation of vascular permeability by gingipains could contributeto the capacity of P. gingivalis to enter the circulatory systems.The capacity of gingipains to attach to endothelial cells asdemonstrated in the present study could potentiate the dam-aging effects of these enzymes, thereby decreasing the integrityand strength of vessel walls, with implications for the risk ofatherosclerosis and related cardiovascular events.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work was supported by a grant from the National Health andMedical Research Council of Australia.REFERENCES1.
