Fa b s t r a c tInflammatory responses of THP-1 cells (macrophage cell line) exposed to chrysotile asbestos (Chry) andLibby six-mix (LIB) and the subsequent impact on bronchial epithelial cells were determined. Directtreatment of THP-1 cells with Chry caused cell death, activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1b, whilethe addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK, reduced IL-1b, suggesting that Chry activated the cas-pase-1 mediated Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome; by comparison, LIB had less effectson all of these parameters. Expression of antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation and nitration, and lipidperoxides in THP-1 cells treated with the two particles suggest that LIB generated more reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) than the same dose of Chry. Differences in fiber length and surface area suggest a possiblerole for particulate size in the differential activation of the inflammasome. BEAS-2B cells, representing thebronchial epithelium, treated with supernatants of medium from Chry- or LIB-treated THP-1 cells (con-ditioned medium) activated the MAPK cascade, increased phosphorylation of ERK and Cot (MAP3K8),increased AP-1 binding activity and induced IL-6 release. To verify that IL-1b from THP-1 cells wasresponsible for activation of BEAS-2B, conditioned medium with added IL-1Ra, an IL-1b antagonist,was applied to BEAS-2B. Results show that IL-1Ra attenuated effects of conditioned medium, supportinga role of IL-1b, as a secondary mediator, in the transduction of inflammatory signaling from the macro-phage to epithelial cells. The effects of LIB-conditioned medium appeared to be less dependent on IL-1b.In conclusion, Chry and LIB induce differential inflammatory responses in THP-1 cells that subsequentlylead to differential effects in epithelial cells.\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Inflammation plays a key role in lung injury, involvingdifferent cell types, such as alveolar macrophages and bronchialepithelial cells that initiate and/or sustain inflammatory processes.Alveolar macrophages provide surveillance of the major bound-aries between the body and the outside world. Macrophages are in-nate immune cells with well-established roles in the primaryresponse to pathogens. These cells recognize danger signalsthrough receptors and activate specific signaling pathways [2].The macrophage-like cell line, THP-1, has been shown to secretethe proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b, upon contact with crocidoliteasbestos [3\u20135]. Mature IL-1b is processed through cleavage of theinactive pro-IL-1b precursor by caspase-1/ICE (IL-1b converting en-zyme). Caspase-1 was the first caspase to be discovered in mam-mals, but only recently has the pathway leading to its activationbeen elucidated and shown to involve a series of large complexes,called inflammasomes [6,7]. Stimulation of macrophages withasbestos resulted in cell death and robust secretion of IL-1b in amanner dependent on the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025mailto:Naomi.Fukagawa@uvm.eduhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokineM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 719also called Nalp3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing pro-tein 3) inflammasome [3,4,8,9]. Previous reports have indicatedthat macrophages from wild-type mice could undergo caspase-1-mediated IL-1b maturation but macrophages deficient in theNLRP3 inflammasome were incapable of secreting IL-1b [3,4,8].Following the initiation of proinflammatory responses uponexposure to asbestos with the release of cytokines, such as IL-1b,alveolar macrophages often die and are cleared from the airway.In contrast, neighboring bronchial epithelial cells can sustain path-ogenic responses and lead to asbestos-related lung disease, even ifthey may not be in direct contact with the asbestos fibers. IL-6 isconsidered to be an important mediator of acute inflammation[10] and implicated in the pathogenesis of particle-related lungdisease. The MAPK pathways contribute to epithelial cell prolifera-tion, which is a major risk factor for the development of lung can-cer or fibro-proliferative diseases [11,12]. Whether IL-1b secretedby THP-1 cells affects the alveolar epithelium leading to cell prolif-eration, inflammation and eventual fibrosis via MAPK-IL-6 path-ways is uncertain although it is well established that directexposure of pulmonary epithelial cells [13], alveolar [14], andbronchial epithelial cells [15,16] to asbestos leads to activation ofMAPK cascades and induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.Several investigators have examined the interaction betweenmacrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, employing a co-culturesystem (Transwell) in which two different cell types were sepa-rated by a membrane with only macrophages exposed to the par-ticles of asbestos or silica [17\u201319]. In the other compartment, theepithelial cells were bathed by the same culture medium. Althoughinteresting connections were suggested, the underlying mecha-nisms whereby primary responses of the macrophage initiatedand interacted with lung epithelial cells remain unclear. We haveinvestigated signal transduction from THP-1 macrophage-like cellsto BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells through a relatively simplemethod: that is, to initially determine the inflammatory responsesof THP-1 exposed to different particulate fibers followed by collec-tion of the supernatants of culture medium without any fibers(termed as conditioned medium) in which BEAS-2B cells were thengrown and their responses assessed.Asbestos occurs naturally and is composed of long thin fibersbroadly classified into two groups: serpentine and amphibole[20]. Chrysotile asbestos (the asbestiform variety of the serpentinegroup) is the most commonly used asbestos type in the US [21]. Theamphibole asbestos group consists of five mineral species: amosite,crocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite. The amphiboleasbestos occurring in the vermiculite mine near Libby, Montana, isa mixture of several different species of amphiboles [22]. Severalresearch groups have studied this material, but the samples usedin the present work are a subset of those discussed in the publica-tion by Meeker et al. [23] and morphologically characterized byBellamy and Gunter [24]. Bellamy and Gunter referred to the Libbymaterial as \u2018\u2018six-mix\u2019\u2019. Because many of the studies examining thepathogenic mechanisms related to aberrant cellular responses toasbestos exposure utilized different forms of asbestos, the presentwork contrasts the signal transduction pathways induced by chrys-otile asbestos (Chry) and Libby six-mix (LIB). The role of IL-1b in theTHP-1-conditioned medium secreted in response to Chry or LIBwas compared and its subsequent effects on BEAS-2B immune re-sponses, specifically IL-6 secretion, were examined.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureTHP-1 cells: THP-1 cells from a human monocyte cell line weregrown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS;100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin; 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM So-dium pyruvate at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2. Cells from this monocytic cellline require differentiation into cells with the functional character-istics of mature macrophages [25,26], accomplished by treatmentwith 100 nM PMA overnight and then refreshing the cells withmedium without PMA. BEAS-2B cells: BEAS-2B cells from the hu-man bronchial epithelial cell line (ATCC) were seeded into flasksor plates pre-coated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/ml fibronectin,0.03 mg/ml bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/ml bovine serumalbumin in medium. The cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS; 100 U/ml of Penicillin/Streptomy-cin, 1 lg/ml Insulin-Transferrin-Na selenite (Sigma), 1 lg/mlHydrocortisone (Sigma), and 10 mM HEPES at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2.2.2. Chrysotile asbestos and Libby six-mix treatmentsChrysotile asbestos fibers (National Institute of EnvironmentalHealth Sciences reference sample, NIEHS), and Libby six-mix (Uni-ted States Geological Service, USGS) have been physically andchemically characterized previously [21,24,27\u201330]. Glass beads(GB) from Polysciences Inc. were used as a noncytotoxic particlecontrol [29]. The surface area of chrysotile measured usingMicromeritics Tristar equipment for nitrogen gas sorption analysisby Happond Expander\u2122 is reported to be 28.83 m2/g (Table 1). TheChry and LIB fibers were sterilized under ultraviolet light overnightprior to suspension in HBSS at 1 mg/ml, sonication for 15 min in awater bath sonicator, and trituration eight times through a 22-gauge needle before treatment of the cells [31]. Two mass-basedconcentration systems have been commonly used in studies ofasbestos exposure: (1) mass concentration, which means the massof a constituent divided by the volume of a carrier and (2) mass-per-area, which is the mass divided by the exposed surface area.The asbestos suspensions were directly added to differentiatedmacrophages or BEAS-2B cells in medium at a mass concentrationof 20 lg/ml and 40 lg/ml for 24 h, which was equivalent to massper area of 5 lg/cm2 and 10 lg/cm2 achieved by adjusting the vol-ume of medium based on the surface area of the culture dishes. Theculture medium collected after exposure of THP-1 cells for 24 hwas centrifuged at the highest speed of an Eppendorf 5430R centri-fuge with 50 ml-tube rotor. Then the supernatant of medium wasused to treat BEAS-2B cells and referred to as conditioned mediumwith indicated asbestos concentration from the original THP-1treatment. Since the conditioned medium contained no particlesand the cellular responses to GB or medium alone were similar, aGB control was not included in the experiments using conditionedmedium.2.3. Caspase-1 inhibitor treatmentsA caspase-1 inhibitor VI, Z-YVAD-FMK (ZYF), was purchasedfrom BioVison and a caspase-1 inhibitor V, Z-D-CH2-DCB (ZD),from Calbiochem. In preliminary experiments, 10, 20, 40 and50 lM of inhibitors were applied to THP-1 cell 30 min prior toasbestos treatment. After 24 h, the inhibitory effects on productionof IL-1b were compared, suggesting that ZYF was more efficientthan ZD. Based on these preliminary results, only 40 lM of ZYFwas used in the subsequent experiments.2.4. IL-1b and IL-1Ra treatmentsRecombinant human IL-1b protein and the antibody for cleavedIL-1b were purchased from Cell Signaling. The IL-1 receptor antag-onist (IL-1Ra) was purchased from Abcam. BEAS-2B cells werechallenged in preliminary experiments by 10, 20, 40, 80, and100 ng/ml recombinant IL-1b to determine its effect on the secre-tion of IL-6. The inhibitory effects of both IL-1Ra and anti-IL-1bTable 1Fiber size references.Fiber name Mean fiberlength (lm)MeanSA (m2/g)SourceGlass beads (GB)a 2.06 3 Polysciences IncChrysotile (Chry) 21b 28.83c NIEHSLIBBY-6-mix (LIB)d 7.21 5 USGSa [29].b [30].c Nitrogen gas sorption analysis by Hammond Expanders\u2122.d [29].720 M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730were also tested and compared. Based on the preliminary results,only 400 ng/ml of IL-1Ra was used in the subsequent experimentsto treat BEAS-2B cells.2.5. CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay viability protocolThe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay (Promega) uses a luminogenic peptidesubstrate (alanyl-alanylphenylalanyl-aminoluciferin; AAF-Glo\u2122Substrate) to measure dead-cell protease activity, which is releasedfrom cells after loss of membrane integrity. The assay is primarilydesigned to selectively detect dead cells; however, with the addi-tion of the lysis reagent (provided in the kit), the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 As-say viability protocol (by lysis) can also deliver the luminescentsignal associated with the total number of cells. Cells were grownand treated as described above and then trypsinized and passedthrough the 40 lm mesh to break the clusters of cells and asbestosfibers. The collected cells were then loaded into a 96-well plate andthe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay reagents applied to wells sequentially fol-lowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The luminescent signals weremeasured in a Synergy HT4 multi-detection microplate reader(BioTek Instruments). Viability was calculated by subtracting theluminescent signal resulting from experimental cell death from to-tal luminescent values.2.6. LDH cytotoxicity assayThe CytoTox 96\ufffd cytotoxicity assay is a colorimetric assay fromPromega. The assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell ly-sis by treatments. Released LDH in culture supernatants wasmeasured after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h treatments with an enzymaticassay, which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt (INT)into a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is propor-tional to the number of lysed cells. Visible wavelength absorbancedata were collected at 490 nm with the Synergy HT4 (BioTekInstruments). The results are expressed as a percentage of maxi-mum LDH released from cells lysed by repeated freezing andthawing.2.7. Cytokine assaysCells were grown and treated as described above; the culturemedium was then collected and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpmin an Eppendorf 5430R centrifuge with a rotor for 1.5 ml-tubes,and the supernatants stored in \ufffd80 \ufffdC until analysis. Cytokinesand chemokines were analyzed using both Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Assay(Bio-Rad) and Milliplex Map\ufffd Assay (Millipore). Bio-Plex-27 hu-man cytokine kits were used in screening of cytokine responses,while Milliplex Map\ufffd custom kits were used for selected cytokines.The samples were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions and run on the Bio-Plex suspension array system(Bio-Rad). Standard curves were calculated and samples were ana-lyzed using the Bio-Plex Manager software version 5 (Bio-Rad).2.8. Caspase-1 FLICA assayZ-YVAD-FMK caspase-1 FLICA kit was purchased from Immuno-chemistry Technologies, LLC. The methodology is based on a fluo-rochrome inhibitor of caspase-1, the FLICA reagent FAM-YVAD-FMK, which enters the cells and binds covalently only to the activecaspase-1. The asbestos-treated THP-1 cells were trypsinized andpassed through the 40 lm mesh. 300 ll of each cell suspension,which contained at least 1 \ufffd 106 cells, were transferred to steriletubes and incubated or washed sequentially with FLICA reagentsaccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The aliquots of cells werethen loaded into microtiter plate wells in different dilutions andfluorescence read on a Synergy HT4 with excitation range from488 to 492 nm, and emission range from 515 to 535 nm.2.9. Western-blot analysisThe antibodies for total or phospho-ERK1/2, caspase-1, total orphospho-NF-jB p65 (S536) were purchased from Cell Signaling;the antibody for total Cot from Santa Cruz; the antibodies for phos-pho-Cot (T290), b-actin and a-tubulin from Abcam Inc.; the anti-bodies for MnSOD, GCLC from Abnova; the antibody for NLRP3from AdipoGen; the antibody for 3-nitrotyrosine from Millipore.Total or nuclear proteins were extracted from treated cells as de-scribed previously [32]. The 20 lg of each total protein was elec-trophoresed on 10% or 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN\ufffd TGX\u2122 precast gels(Bio-Rad) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.After blocking the membranes with 1% BSA blocking/dilution buf-fer, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primaryantibody at the recommended concentration overnight with shak-ing at 4 \ufffdC and then rinsed. After incubation with correspondingsecondary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized using aSuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Trial Kit (PIERCE) and exposed to radio-graphic films. The images and densities were captured with a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and analyzedwith Quantity One Software Version 4.2 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).The membranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted withanother antibody or loading control: b-actin or a-tubulin antibody.2.10. Oxidized protein detectionProtein carbonyl modifications were detected and quantifiedusing the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay (Millipore) according the manufac-turer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, BEAS-2B cells were treated with Chryand LIB and protein lysates were incubated with 2, 4-dinitrophen-ylhydrazine (DNPH). The DNP-derivative protein samples wereseparated by SDS\u2013PAGE followed by Western blotting. The samemembranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with b-actinas a loading control.2.11. Lipid and aqueous peroxides assayLipid and aqueous peroxides in THP-1 conditioned mediumwere measured with the OxiSelect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide AssayKit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Peroxide in the medium converts Fe2+ into Fe3+, which reacts withan equal molar amount in the presence of acid to create a purpleproduct that absorbs maximally between 540 and 600 nm. Sam-ples were then reacted with xylenol orange in 96-well plate andread on the Synergy HT4. The peroxide content in unknown sam-ples was calculated by comparison with the predetermined H2O2standard curve.M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 7212.12. EMSA for AP-1Double stranded AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were pur-chased from Promega. The probes were labeled with [c-32P] ATPusing T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the man-ufacturer\u2019s protocol. EMSA was performed as described previously[33]. The 6 lg of nuclear extracts from BEAS-2B cells exposed toChry, LIB or 10 ng/ml of TNF-a were used in the binding assay;1 ll of anti c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz) were applied to supershiftthe AP-1 complexes, respectively; cold AP-1 probes were also in-cluded at 1:100 M ratios for probe competition.2.13. StatisticsValues are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM for indicated numbers ofexperiments, or mean \u00b1 SD for measurement with replicates. Themean values are reported as a percentage of control. Comparisonswere performed using one way Anova (GraphPad). The p valueswere considered to be significant if they were 60.05.Fig. 1. Cell viability and cytotoxicity. THP-1 cells differentiated with 100 nM PMAwere refreshed and exposed to 20 lg/ml or 40 lg/ml of chrysotile (Chry20, Chry40)and LIB (Lib20, Lib40), and 40 lg/ml glass beads (GB).

Cell viability in response to asbestos exposureCell viabilities were assessed with the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay andresults shown in Fig. 1A and B. Differences between the two celllines were found in the responses to direct exposure of THP-1and BEAS-2B cells to 20 or 40 lg/ml of Chry (Chry20, Chry40)and LIB (Lib20, Lib40). After 24 h of exposure, Chry significantly re-duced the survival of THP-I cells compared to control, whereas LIBhad less of an effect (Fig. 1A). No reduction of cell viability wasseen in BEAS-2B cells with the treatments compared to control;however, cell number based on the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay slightlyincreased with LIB treatments (Fig. 1B). To confirm the result fromFig. 1A, a LDH cytotoxicity assay was used in THP cells treated withChry and LIB for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h (Fig. 1C). Cell death graduallyincreased with increasing exposure times. By 24 h, Chry40 had in-duced significant cell death (\ufffd60%), with lesser degrees induced byChry20, LIB40 and LIB20. Together the data indicate selective cyto-toxicity in macrophages exposed to asbestos compared to epithe-lial cells.3.2. IL-1b and caspase-1 responses in THP-1 cellsCytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured in thesupernatant of the culture medium from treated THP-1 cells usingthe human Bio-Plex array (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 forcomplete set of data). IL-1b was the most prominently inducedcytokine. Fig. 2A shows the results of induction of IL-1b in 3 inde-pendent experiments when THP-1 cells were treated with Chryand LIB for 24 h. Chry20 induced a 4-fold and Chry40 a 6-fold in-crease in IL-1b secretion compared to the control; whereas Lib40induced IL-1b secretion by only 2.9-fold. Meanwhile GB and con-trol resulted in similar levels of IL-1b. Other cytokines found tobe significantly induced included IL-1Ra, G-CSF and IL-2 (see Sup-plementary Table 2).The combination of cell death and IL-1b secretion suggested thepossible involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3expression was hence determined by Western-blot and showedthat NLRP3 protein level was higher in all treatments comparedto control. However, none of treatments achieved statistical signif-icance compared to control (Fig. 2B).Pro-caspase-1, an assembling member of the inflammasomecomplex, is proteolytically activated from a proenzyme to producetwo active subunits, p20 and p10, with p20 being identifiable byimmuno-blotting. Fig. 3A shows a representative blot and a sum-mary of data obtained from three independent experiments. Re-sults suggest that active p20 was induced by the Chrytreatments, especially Chry40, but to a lesser degree by LIB treat-ments with no effect by GB. To further confirm the activation ofcaspase-1 in Chry-treatments, the caspase-1 FLICA assay was per-formed and the result revealed that Chry40 clearly increased cas-pase-1 activity in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 3B).The activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1b are twoimportant consequences of inflammasome activation. To verifywhether blocking caspase-1 activation would reduce maturationof IL-1b in macrophages, a caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK(ZYF) was used in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and treated with40 lg/ml asbestos. Application of ZYF showed a trend towardsFig. 2. IL_1b release and NLRP3 priming. (A) Release of IL-1b in THP-1 cells was analyzed with a Bio-Plex 27 cytokine array. THP-1 cells were grown and treated with Chry andLIB for 24 h as described; the supernatant of culture medium was collected and then analyzed.

Meanwhile, Fig. 3C showsthat IL-1b was significantly induced by Chry20 and Chry40 withless effect of Lib40 and no effect of GB. ZYF significantly repressedthe Chry40 and Lib40 effects resulting in little IL-1b detectable inthe medium. These results suggest that IL-1b secretion in responseto asbestos is caspase-1 dependent.3.3. Comparison of ROS production in Chry and LIB treated THP-1 cellsOxidative stress is another potential mediator for particle-in-duced inflammation in cells. Two antioxidant related enzymes,Fig. 3.

Blake et al. have reported inmurine macrophages that internalization of LIB asbestos fibersgenerated a significant increase in intracellular ROS, decreasedGSH levels, and impaired total SOD activity [34]. To clarify the oxi-dative stress status in Chry- and LIB- treated THP-1 cells, theexpression of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and GCLC were comparedby Western blots. The upper panel of Fig. 4A shows protein blots ofthe two enzymes in THP-1 cells treated with either Chry or LIB; theing both active p20 subunits and other caspase-1 protein components in Chry- andtor, ZYF. b-actin in the same blot served as a loading control.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 723lower bar-graphs summarizes MnSOD and GCLC expression inthree experiments. Induction of MnSOD was found in response toChry but not seen in GB and LIB-treated cells. Meanwhile, an in-crease of GCLC was seen in LIB treated cells but there was littlein GB and Chry-treated cells. The difference between the responsesto Chry and LIB treatments suggests that the two particulates in-duced oxidative stress to different degrees. Protein carbonyl mod-ifications were then determined using the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay. Arepresentative blot (Fig. 4B) shows that THP-1 cells treated withLib40 displayed a dramatic increase in the number and degree ofoxidized proteins as compared to control, GB and Chry40-treatedcells. This suggests that more oxidative stress is generated by LIBamphiboles compared to Chry. Reactive nitrogen species is anotherindicator of oxidative stress. Protein tyrosine nitration in Chry- andLIB- treated THP-1 cells was also compared and shown in a repre-sentative blot in Fig. 4C. LIB induced more 3-nitrotyrosine forma-tion than Chry treatments. Finally, the existence of lipidperoxides in conditioned medium was evaluated with the OxiSe-lect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide Assay as shown in Fig. 4D. LIB treatmentsresulted in more lipid peroxide in conditioned medium than Chrytreatments with most of the peroxide found in the lipid rather thanaqueous fraction. There was a significant difference between theresponses to Lib20 compared to Chry20.3.4. Role of IL-1b in BEAS-2B responses to THP-1-conditioned mediumBEAS-2B cells were directly treated with Chry and LIB for 24 h.The induction of IL-6 by direct exposure of epithelial cells to Chryhas been described elsewhere [17,35]; therefore in the presentwork, Chry-40 was used as a \u2018\u2018positive control\u2019\u2019. IL-6 was foundto be significantly induced by Chry40 and less so by Lib40 in di-rectly treated BEAS-2B cells, as shown in Fig. 5A.BEAS-2B cells were then grown in THP-1 conditioned mediumfor 24 h as well. Because the IL-1b levels in GB-conditioned med-ium was consistent with control, as described in Section 3.2, GB-conditioned medium was not used in the conditionally treatedBEAS-2B cells. Several cytokines were found to be induced by con-ditioned medium (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The mostsignificant change occurred in IL-6 levels as shown in Fig. 5B. Incomparison to Fig. 5A, direct treatment with Chry40 induced a4.8-fold increase of IL-6 compared to control; whereas the increasein IL-6 by Chry40-conditioned medium was only 1.5-fold. The in-crease in IL-6 by LIB-conditioned medium was less than seen withChry-conditioned medium. These data support the contention thatinduction of IL-6 by THP-1 conditioned medium may be related toIL-1b.Activation of the MAPK cascade is a prominent finding in epi-thelial cells directly treated with asbestos [16,36]. Recently, an-other inflammatory protein kinase, Cot (cancer osaka thyroidoncogene), which is also known as Tpl2 (tumor progression locus2) or MAP3K8 and functions upstream of MAPK signaling has beendescribed [37]. BEAS-2B cells directly treated with Chry and LIBparticles showed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phos-phorylation of Cot kinase at Tyr290 compared to control (see Sup-plementary Fig. 1A and B). To determine whether conditionedmedium had the same stimulatory function as directly treatedBEAS-2B cells, activation of ERK and Cot was examined in BEAS-2B cells treated with THP-1 conditioned medium. Fig. 6A showsinduction of P-ERK and P-Cot by Chry- and LIB-conditioned med-ium, similar to effects seen in directly treated cells.Since the transcription factor NF-jB has also been suggested toplay a key role in the regulation of IL-6 expression and IL-1b isknown to specifically induce phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 atSer536 [38], the phosphorylation status of NF-jB p65 at Ser536was also examined in conditionally treated BEAS-2B cells. The re-sults revealed that phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at Ser536 was in-duced by Chry40-conditioned medium (Fig. 6B). Activation of AP-1,which is downstream of MAPK pathways, is another important fea-ture of asbestos-treated epithelial cells. Thus, the binding activityof AP-1 was compared by EMSA, as shown in Fig. 6C, and demon-strated that the binding activity of AP-1 was augmented by bothChry40 and Lib20 conditioned medium.To determine if IL-1b itself could activate BEAS-2B cells to se-crete IL-6 as it appears to have done with conditioned medium,we treated cells with recombinant human IL-1b protein. IL-1Ra,an antagonist protein of IL-1b, was also used in parallel to test itseffect on inhibition of IL-1b. Fig. 7A summarizes the IL-1b effecton IL-6 secretion. Treatment of BEAS-2B with 10 ng/ml of IL-1b in-duced \ufffd1.6-fold increase in IL-6 secretion compared to control, butincreasing the dose beyond 10 ng/ml did not show a dose-depen-dent increase of IL-6 (data not shown). The effect of 100 ng/ml ofIL-1b on IL-6 was even lower than the effect of 10 ng/ml. This find-ing is consistent with an effective dose in pharmacology (ED50)where the ED50 of recombinant IL-1b is commonly reported tobe much less than 10 ng/ml. The IL-1Ra molecule is structurally re-lated to IL-1b but has mutations rendering it incapable of forming acomplex with IL-1b/IL-1RI/IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) [39]. IL-1Ra-treatment did successfully suppress IL-6secretion.Although BEAS-2B cells treated with conditioned medium didnot have direct contact with asbestos fibers, both direct and condi-tioned medium treatments resulted in phosphorylation of MAPKand secretion of IL-6. In addition, IL-1b itself can stimulate BEAS-2B in the same manner. The component in the conditioned med-ium that mediated the inflammatory message from THP-1 cellsto BEAS-2B cells is likely to be IL-1b. The specificity of the IL-1b ef-fect in conditioned medium was hence tested by IL-1Ra to seewhether IL-1Ra competitively blocked IL-1b in the conditionedmedium and consequently affected the cellular responses ofBEAS-2B cells. BEAS-2B cells were treated with THP-1-conditionedmedium, in addition to Chry40 and Lib40 with or without 40 lM ofZYF (Chry40, Chry40 + ZYF, Lib40, Lib40 + ZYF) for 24 h. 400 ng/mlof IL-1Ra inhibitor was added to another set of Chry40- or Lib40-conditioned media (Chry40 + IL-1Ra, Lib40 + IL-1Ra). Fig. 7B illus-trates the corresponding changes in IL-6 by the Milli-Plex 2 Assaydone in triplicate. Conditioned medium of Chry40 + ZYF slightlydecreased IL-6; however, addition of IL-1Ra to Chry40-conditionedmedium had a much greater effect on the suppression of IL-6 re-lease. In contrast, LIB treatments showed the same trends, butnone of the differences reached significance. Fig. 7C shows a repre-sentative of Western-blots on the top and two summary graphs be-low. Results in Fig. 7C indicates the same trend of the inhibitoryeffects of IL-1Ra on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cot byChry40-conditioned medium.In summary, both IL-6 and MAPK results demonstrate thatblocking of IL-1b leads to down-regulation of the effects ofChry40-conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. This suggests that IL-1b in Chry-conditioned medium is responsible for triggeringinflammatory responses in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, blocking ofIL-1b appears to play a smaller role in the effects induced by LIB.3.5. Comparison of cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects based onmatched surface areaWe have compared the effects of Chry and LIB using mass con-centrations of 20 and 40 lg/ml that is equivalent to mass-per-areaof 5 and 10 lg/cm2. To further evaluate whether the total surfacearea (SA) of particles affected the respective responses, the otherapproach which measures \u2018\u2018the total surface area per unit ofcross-sectional area\u2019\u2019 was also examined.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730different from Lib150. These data suggest that Chry had a muchgreater effect on IL-1b and IL-6 secretion than LIB, which was inde-pendent of matched total surface area.4. Discussion4.1. IL-1b acts as a secondary mediatorThe present data elucidate the role of IL-1b in the primary re-sponses of the macrophage and its interaction with epithelial cellsas follows: (1) when exposed to Chry and LIB, THP-1 cells under-went a caspase-1 mediated inflammasome activation that resultedin an inflammatory form of cell death which now known as pyrop-tosis [40] and produced the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b; (2)exogenous IL-1b treatment activated BEAS-2B and triggeredBEAS-2B inflammatory responses; (3) THP-1 conditioned medium,containing secreted IL-1b, mimicked the effect of IL-1b treatment;and (4) blocking IL-1b by IL-1Ra antagonist protein diminished theeffects of conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. Together, it appearsthat the IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium acts as the secondarymediator that stimulates the BEAS-2B immune response to Chryand LIB.However, activation of target cells by IL-1b is tightly regulatedat many levels, both extracellularly and intracellularly [39,41].The extracellular regulation includes the presence of naturallyoccurring inhibitors, such as the receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. Inaddition to the release of IL-1b, THP-1 cells also released IL-1Rasimultaneously, as shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Thus,the effect of endogenous IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned mediumwas naturally restricted when it was applied to BEAS-2B cells. Allof these inhibitory effects could explain why a dramatic 10-foldhigher level of IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium treated withChry40 was limited to only 1.5-fold greater release of IL-6 byBEAS-2B cells.4.2. Chry and LIB differentially activate the inflammasome in THP-1cellsIn the present work, through comparison of THP-1 cells re-sponses to Chry with LIB, we demonstrated that chrysotile asbestoshas more effect on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome thanLIB. Although Fig. 2B did not show that the NLRP3 expression inChry treatments is higher than in LIB, activation of caspase-1 andrelease of IL-1b were greater in Chry than LIB treatments. NLRP3inflammasome activation has been defined as a rapid process inwhich caspase-1 cleavage is induced. The process is independentof upstream de novo transcription [42]. Cell priming through mul-tiple signaling receptors that induce NLRP3 expression is necessaryFig. 8.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 727but not sufficient for NLRP3 activation [43]. This priming can beovercome solely by constitutive NLRP3 expression. Actually, mac-rophages appear to express high levels of NLRP3 constitutivelyand can bypass the requirement of NLRP3 expression [44,45].Therefore, it is the activation of caspase-1, rather than expressionof NLRP3, that is a key indicator of activation of NLRP3 inflamma-some in THP-1 cells.Environmental toxicants (such as asbestos) and damage-associ-ated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate the NLRP3 inflamma-some, but the mechanisms by which these structurally distinctmolecules trigger NLRP3 oligomerization and inflammasome acti-vation are currently unclear and have been intensely debated inthe literature [46]. A model in which the generation of ROS isone of the crucial elements for NLRP3 activation has been sug-gested [47]. However, recent studies in mice and humans defectivein the generation of ROS failed to support this hypothesis andstrongly suggested anti-inflammatory effects of ROS [48,49]. Fur-thermore, SOD was reported to be required for the activation ofcaspase-1; SOD1 deficiency led to more ROS in macrophages butcaused caspase-1 inhibition by specific oxidation and glutathiony-lation [50].In this study, Chry did not generate more intracellular ROS thanLIB (Fig. 4), which was associated with more protein oxidation andtyrosine nitration. In addition, Chry promoted production ofMnSOD protein but LIB did not. It seems unlikely that ROS weredriving activation of the inflammasome in Chry treated THP-1 cells.However, an alternative model of inflammasome activation thattakes into account the size of the activators is the lysosome rupturemodel, which is particularly useful in explaining NLRP3 inflamma-some activation by large particulate activators, such as Chry.According to this model, when phagocytosed particulates are toolarge to be efficiently cleared, inefficient clearance of the activatingparticle following phagocytosis leads to phagosomal destabiliza-tion and lysosomal rupture [47]. Lysosomal damage results in therelease of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol that mediatesNLRP3 inflammasome activation [51,52]. Since the selected modelfor inflammasome activation is closely related to the particulatesize, it is reasonable to link the consequences of THP-1 cells in re-sponse to Chry and LIB with their remarkably different physicalsizes. Chrysotile fibers belong to the group of longer and thinner fi-bers; the length of Chry is about 3 times that of LIB, and the meansurface area is about 5\u20136 times that of LIB (see Table 1), suggestingthat Chry has more potential to result in aggressive lysosomal rup-ture and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It hasbeen well-demonstrated that longer fibers are incapable of under-going phagocytosis in vitro and in animals [21]. Long fibers have agreater potency than short fibers in assays of pro-inflammatoryand genotoxic activity [53], and stimulate greater release of IL-1bby macrophages [5]. Therefore, further study of the correlationsbetween particle size and activation of the inflammasome wouldbe particularly interesting. In contrast, LIB probably stimulatesmore ROS production via a tightly controlled ROS-mediated model[51] in which, ROS primes NLRP3 on the one hand, but may impactinflammasome activation and down-regulate caspase-1 activity onthe other hand.4.3. Signaling cascade in BEAS-2B cells mediated by the conditionedmediumWe have demonstrated that IL-1b is a major player in THP-1conditioned medium, leading to the initiation of the inflammatoryresponse in the BEAS-2B cells. Besides IL-1b, we also detected lip-ids peroxides in conditioned medium (Fig. 4D) which is possiblyanother \u2018\u2018alarm\u2019\u2019 signal that triggers responses in BEAS-2B. How-ever, this should be specifically identified and confirmed in futurestudies.Combining our findings with those from others, the processthrough which IL-1b triggers BEAS-2B release of IL-6 likely consistsFig. 9. Proposed schema for Chry and LIB induced signal transduction from the macrophage to the epithelium. In the macrophage \u2018\u2018priming\u2019\u2019 step, the pro-inflammatorysignals mediate activation of receptors and induction of NLRP3, procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1b. When macrophages are exposed to chrysotile fibers, phagocytosis is followed byphagosomal destabilization and lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal damage results in the release of cathepsin B into the cytosol that triggers three members of NLRP3inflammasome to assemble and subsequent activation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). This second step eventually activates pro-caspase-1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1b. In comparison to chrysotile, the relatively smaller size of the Libby amphibole probably results in more ROS production via a tightlycontrolled ROS-mediated model in which, ROS activate NLRP3, although high oxygen tension can also impact inflammasome function and down-regulate caspase-1 activity.In the epithelial cell, IL-1b signal transduction is initiated through a ligand-induced conformational change in the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitatesrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Meanwhile, IL-1Ra can block the IL-1b signaling. The trimetric complex rapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, MYD88, and IRAK,then through TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) linked to the downstream protein kinase cascades, including MAPK kinase family, Cot and IjB kinases (IKKs). Theactivation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor; the IKKb-mediated phosphorylation of p65 modulates NF-jB activity. Both AP-1 andNF-jB can directly up-regulate its target gene, IL-6. IL-6 further contributes to asbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.728 M.

The initial step in IL-1b signal transduction is a ligand-induced conformational changein the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitatesrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Through conserved cytosolic regionscalled Toll- and IL-1R-like (TIR) domains, the trimetric complexrapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, myeloid dif-ferentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and interleukin-1receptor\u2013activated protein kinase (IRAK) [41]. The IL-1R\ufffdTLRreceptor-mediated signals, which are linked to the downstreamprotein kinase cascades, have been studied extensively. Membersof the MAPK kinase (MAPKKK; called MAP3 K here) family, includ-ing MEKK1, 2, 3 and Cot (Tpl2 or MAP3K8) are critical in this pro-cess [54\u201356]. The activation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads toactivation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which could directlyup-regulate its target gene, IL-6. In addition, the IKKb-mediatedphosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 requires the upstream kinasesCot (Tpl2) and PKCf [57]. Then, in turn, IL-6 may act as a significantautocrine growth factor in epithelial cells [58,59] to further induceasbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lungcancer, and mesothelioma.5. ConclusionWe have investigated the signal transduction from the THP-1macrophages to bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) in responseto Chry and LIB through direct treatments of THP-1 cells followedby THP-1 conditioned medium treatments of BEAS-2B. We foundthat direct treatments of THP-1 cells with Chry and LIB differen-tially activated the inflammasome in processing IL-1b. IL-1b in con-ditioned medium acts as a secondary mediator to trigger BEAS-2Bcells signaling cascades, including ERK, Cot, and then AP-1 and NF-kB, to induce IL-6, which then leads epithelial cells to pathologicphenotypes. Using IL-1Ra could interrupt the interaction andmay have a potential therapeutic effect when exposure to patho-genic particles occurs.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Brooke T.
