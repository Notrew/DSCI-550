However, little is known about the interaction between S. pyogenesand bone cells. We report here that S. pyogenes strain JRS4 (M6) attached to and invaded mouse primaryosteoblasts. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection of osteoblasts stimulatedexpression of mRNA for the receptor activator of NF-\ufffdB ligand (RANKL). Western blot analysis followed byligand precipitation with the receptor activator of NF-\ufffdB receptor showed that there was an increase inRANKL protein in infected osteoblasts. Production of interleukin-6 was also stimulated, but no production ofinterleukin-1\ufffd or tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed. Stimulation of RANKL production was notobserved in osteoblasts stimulated with heat-inactivated S. pyogenes, suggesting that an active interaction of S.pyogenes with osteoblasts is essential for this phenomenon. A Western blot analysis performed with antibodiesspecific for phosphorylated signal transduction proteins demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection inducesphosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. A specific inhibitor of this kinase, SB203580, inhib-ited RANKL production by infected osteoblasts. These results suggest that infection of osteoblasts by S.pyogenes stimulates RANKL production and may trigger bone destruction in infected bone tissue.Bacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destruc-tive joint disease in humans. Staphylococcus aureus is the mostfrequently isolated bacterial pathogen associated with non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis (12); however, beta-hemolyticstreptococci are the second-most-frequently associated bacte-ria and account for 14 to 15% of the cases of nongonococcalbacterial arthritis (26). Serotype classification studies of strep-tococcal bacterial arthritis have revealed that the most com-mon agent is group A Streptococcus pyogenes, followed bygroup B, group C, and group G (26). In addition, S. pyogenesoften causes poststreptococcal reactive arthritis (3, 12). Thistype of arthritis is not associated with carditis or other majormanifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Several investigatorshave recommended that patients with poststreptococcal reac-tive arthritis should receive prophylactic antimicrobial agentsfor years (3, 12).S. pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) is a pathogen thatis responsible for human diseases whose severities vary, rang-ing from nonsuppurative infections of the pharynx and skin totoxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis (9). Al-though bacterial arthritis caused by S. aureus (30) and group BStreptococcus agalactiae (31, 32) has been studied, little isknown about S. pyogenes-induced bacterial arthritis. Very re-cently, we have found that intravenous injection of S. pyogenesinto mice causes bacterial arthritis (submitted for publication).Mice inoculated with an S. pyogenes strain manifested clinicalarthritis characterized by early onset of acute exudative syno-vitis, permanent lesions with irreversible joint damage, andankylosis. This may be a good animal model to study bacterialarthritis caused by S. pyogenes and may also be a useful modelto study poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. A number of S.pyogenes cells were recovered from the arthritic joints of in-fected mice, suggesting that S. pyogenes colonizes the jointtissues.It has been reported that S. pyogenes efficiently invades ep-ithelial cells (15, 20, 21, 24). S. pyogenes has fibronectin-bindingproteins, such as proteins F1 and Fba, which are considered tobe an adhesin and an invasin (13, 21, 24). It has also beenreported that S. pyogenes triggers activation of cell death path-ways and induces cellular apoptosis of epithelial cells. How-ever, the effects of S. pyogenes infection on bone cells, such asosteoblasts, remain unknown.Previous investigations of the bacterial arthritis induced byS. aureus and S. agalactiae suggested that several cytokines,such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd), interleukin-1\ufffd(IL-1\ufffd), and IL-6, are involved in the pathogenesis of bacterialarthritis (30, 32). However, these studies did not consider thepossible role of receptor activator of NF-\ufffdB ligand (RANKL)in bacterial arthritis. RANKL, also called TRANCE (2),OPGL (18), and ODF (34), is a recently discovered transmem-brane molecule belonging to the TNF ligand superfamily thatis expressed in lymphoid tissues and trabecular bone (17, 27,34). RANKL is thought to be the essential and final commonsignal required both in vitro and in vivo for full osteoclasticdifferentiation from multipotential hematopoietic precursorcells into mature multinucleated bone-resorptive osteoclasts inthe presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (17, 18,* Corresponding author.

E-mail: okahashi@dent.osaka-u.ac.jp.94827, 34). Recently, Kotake et al. (19) reported that an increasedconcentration of RANKL is detected in synovial fluid frompatients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that RANKLplays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoidarthritis. RANKL is expressed on activated osteoblasts, as wellas on activated T cells (2, 17, 19, 27, 28, 34). The role ofRANKL on activated osteoblasts in osteoclastogenesis iswidely recognized, whereas the significance of RANKL on Tcells is controversial because activated T cells produce gammainterferon, which strongly inhibits osteoclastogenesis (17, 28).In this study, we investigated adherence of and invasion by S.pyogenes with mouse osteoblastic cells. We found that infectionby S. pyogenes triggers expression of RANKL and other proin-flammatory cytokines in osteoblasts. The production of thesecytokines may contribute to bone destruction in the bacterialarthritis caused by group A S. pyogenes.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice and reagents. Female ddY mice were obtained from Japan SLC(Hamamatsu, Japan). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and SB203580 were purchasedfrom Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Phospho-specific antibodies againstmouse extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mouse c-Jun N-ter-minal kinase (JNK), and mouse p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech (Beverly, Mass.). A recombinantmouse receptor activator of NF-\ufffdB/Fc (RANK/Fc) chimera protein and anti-mouse RANKL antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,Minn.).Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and preparation of heat-inactivated bac-terial cells and bacterial supernatant. Group A S. pyogenes strain JRS4 (M6\ufffdF1\ufffd) and the isogenic mutant strains JRS145 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd) and SAM1 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd)were provided by E. Hanski (The Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical School,Jerusalem, Israel) (13); these organisms were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (BBL,Cockeysville, Md.) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY) and were usedin the infection assay. JRS145 is an isogenic M6-deficient mutant of JRS4,whereas SAM1 is deficient in protein F1, a fibronectin-binding protein. JRS4 (1\ufffd 1010 CFU/ml) was heat inactivated by incubating it at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. Toprepare bacterial supernatant, S. pyogenes JRS4 was cultured for 18 h at 37\u00b0C ina dialysate medium consisting of THY broth. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to acentrifuged supernatant solution at 50% saturation. The precipitate was col-lected by centrifugation and dissolved in a small volume of phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) (pH 7.2). The concentrated bacterial supernatant was extensivelydialyzed against PBS and used as an extracellular protein of S. pyogenes.Primary mouse osteoblasts. Primary mouse osteoblasts were isolated from1-day-old mouse calvariae after five routine sequential digestions with 0.1%collagenase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and 0.2% dispase (GodoShusei, Tokyo, Japan), as previously described (4, 23). Osteoblasts were culturedin alpha minimum essential medium (\ufffdMEM) (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island,N.Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO BRL). Immunochemicalstaining with osteocalcin and staining for alkaline phosphatase activity demon-strated that more than 95% of the cells showed osteoblastic characteristics (4,23).Invasion and adhesion assay. Mid-log-phase bacteria were added to osteoblastcultures grown in 24-well culture plates (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10), andthe cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. To determine the numbers ofadherent and internalized bacteria, the cultures were incubated for 4 h. Afterunattached bacteria were washed off with PBS, the osteoblasts were disrupted byextensive pipetting with sterile water and then serially diluted in water and platedon THY agar plates. For the invasion assay, bacteria were added to osteoblastcultures and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. After the wells were washedwith PBS, the attached bacteria were killed by 1 h of incubation with gentamicin(100 \ufffdg/ml; Sigma) and penicillin (100 U/ml). Then the cells were disrupted withsterile water. The intracellular bacteria were suspended in water, serially diluted,and plated on THY agar plates to determine the number of intracellular bacteria(15).Immunocytochemical analysis. Osteoblasts were seeded onto eight-wellLabTek chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc International, Naperville, Ill.). The cellswere infected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing S.pyogenes JRS4 (21) at an MOI of 10. Invasion by and adhesion of the EGFP-expressing S. pyogenes strain were analyzed by using a confocal microscopesystem (model LSM510; Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde for 2 h after infection with EGFP-expressing S. pyogenes, andthis was followed by staining with anti-S. pyogenes antibody (1:100 dilution) andAlexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:500 dilution; Mo-lecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). The anti-S. pyogenes antibody was prepared byimmunizing rabbits with lyophilized whole cells of S. pyogenes (21). Under theconfocal conditions used, the emission of EGFP was quenched by the emissionof Alexa Fluor 568, resulting in red fluorescence from the adhered bacteria.Intracellular bacteria exhibited green fluorescence from EGFP (21).RT-PCR assay and real-time PCR analysis. For reverse transcription-PCR(RT-PCR), total RNA was prepared from cells by using TRIzol reagent (GIBCOBRL), and 2 \ufffdg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence ofoligo(dT)15 by using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (GIBCO BRL)according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA samples were tested forintegrity and amount of input RNA by RT-PCR with \ufffd-actin, which served as anendogenous control. To quantitate RANKL mRNA, a real-time PCR was per-formed by using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, Calif.) with a SYBR Green reagent. Samples were subjectedto 40 cycles of amplification consisting of 95\u00b0C for 15 s followed by 60\u00b0C for 1 minaccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Applied Biosystems). Each assaywas normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The nor-malized data were expressed the following two ways: (i) as a percentage of thegene expression in osteoblasts stimulated with 2 \ufffdM PGE2, and (ii) as a foldincrease compared with the mRNA level of unstimulated cells. The primers usedin this study are listed in Table 1.Ligand receptor precipitation. Osteoblasts cultured in the absence or presenceof stimulants were lysed by addition of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris buffer [pH 8.0],150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, complete protease inhibitorcocktail [Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany]). After sonica-tion for a short time, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000\ufffd g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrationwas determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill.).RANK-immobilized beads were prepared by agitating mouse RANK/Fc (R&DSystems) with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,Calif.) overnight at 4\u00b0C (22). RANK/Fc protein was bound to protein A/G beadsat concentration of 20 \ufffdg/ml of beads. Cell lysates containing approximately 0.5mg/ml were precipitated with 20 \ufffdl of RANK-immobilized agarose beads in lysisbuffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. The RANKL-RANK precipitated materials were recov-ered by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample loading buffer (1% SDS,10 mM Tris buffer [pH 6.8], 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and weresubjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot-ting (22).Western blot analysis. Osteoblasts cultured in the absence or presence ofstimulants were washed with PBS and dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl containing0.2% SDS (pH 6.8). Extracted proteins (50 \ufffdg) were separated by SDS-PAGEand electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Proteins or phos-phorylated proteins were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Phar-macia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).RESULTSExpression of RANKL and osteotrophic cytokines in osteo-blasts as a result of S. pyogenes infection. It was reportedpreviously that S. pyogenes is able to attach to and invademammalian epithelial cells; however, little information is avail-able regarding the attachment to and invasion of osteoblasts byS. pyogenes. As shown in Fig. 1, wild-type strain JRS4 exhibit-ing type 6 M protein (M6) and fibronectin-binding protein F1was found to attach to and be internalized in mouse primaryosteoblasts. The level of adhesion to and invasion of mouseosteoblasts by S. pyogenes JRS4 was comparable to the level ofadhesion to and invasion of human pharyngeal carcinoma ep-ithelial HEp-2 cells, which was estimated in a previous study(21). Osteoblasts are known to produce RANKL, an osteoclas-togenic cytokine, in response to several humoral factors, suchas IL-1 and PGE2. Thus, it is important to clarify whetherosteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes produce RANKL and/orother osteotropic cytokines. RT-PCR revealed that osteoblastsVOL. 71, 2003 STREPTOCOCCI INDUCE RANKL PRODUCTION IN OSTEOBLASTS 949infected with S. pyogenes expressed RANKL mRNA (Fig. 2A).We found that the amounts of RANKL protein on osteoblastswere less than the limit of detection of conventional Westernblot analysis even after stimulation with PGE2. Therefore, weemployed a ligand receptor precipitation technique (22) tospecifically concentrate RANKL protein and to detect proteinexpression on osteoblasts. Western blot analysis after ligandprecipitation demonstrated that osteoblasts stimulated withPGE2 produced RANKL protein with a molecular mass ofapproximately 40 kDa. Osteoblasts infected with JRS4 alsoproduced detectable amounts of RANKL protein (Fig. 2B).RT-PCR performed with the primer pairs that targeted IL-1\ufffd, IL-6, TNF-\ufffd, or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\ufffd)revealed that osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 pro-duced IL-6 (Fig. 3). An increase in the TGF-\ufffd level was alsodetectable. Neither IL-1\ufffd nor TNF-\ufffd was detectableQuantitative analysis of RANKL expression in osteoblastsinfected with S. pyogenes. Quantitative analysis by real-timePCR revealed that the RANKL expression in osteoblaststreated with S. pyogenes was fivefold greater than the RANKLexpression in uninfected cells at 6 h after infection (Fig. 4). Theinduction of RANKL mRNA expression in osteoblasts exhib-ited a dose-dependent relationship. As shown in Fig. 4A and B,when the ratio of the number of cells of S. pyogenes in theinoculum to the number of osteoblasts was increased from 1:1to 10:1, there was a concomitant increase in RANKL mRNAexpression. The time-dependent increase in RANKL mRNAexpression is shown in Fig. 4C. The expression of RANKLmRNA in infected cells was fivefold greater than the expres-sion in the uninfected controls at 6 h. Longer infection periodsresulted in overgrowth of S. pyogenes in the infected cultures,which led to death of osteoblasts.In contrast to viable S. pyogenes, heat-inactivated S. pyogenesdid not induce RANKL mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.4D, exposure of mouse osteoblasts to heat-inactivated (60\u00b0C,30 min) S. pyogenes was not a potent stimulus for RANKLexpression. Viable S. pyogenes at a ratio of 10:1 routinely in-duced expression of fivefold more RANKL mRNA, whereasheat-inactivated S. pyogenes did not stimulate RANKL mRNAexpression even at a ratio of 100:1. The effect of S. pyogenesJRS4 supernatant on RANKL expression in osteoblasts wasalso examined. Bacterial supernatant was prepared from cul-ture supernatant of S. pyogenes JRS4 and added to osteoblastcultures. No stimulation of RANKL mRNA expression in os-teoblasts was observed at concentrations of 10 to 50 \ufffdg of totalprotein per ml of osteoblast culture (data not shown).Previous investigations have demonstrated that protein F1mediates cellular invasion by S. pyogenes JRS4 (13, 21, 24). Weinvestigated the adherence of and invasion by isogenic mutantstrains JRS145 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd) and SAM1 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd). An adhe-sion study revealed that the number of JRS145 cells that ad-hered to osteoblasts was significantly lower than the number ofwild-type JRS4 cells that adhered to osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). Onthe other hand, invasion by SAM1 was significantly reducedand was \ufffd10% of the invasion by JRS4 (Fig. 5B). These resultssuggest that F1 protein plays an important role in the invasionof osteoblasts by S. pyogenes. The levels of RANKL expressionFIG. 1.

INFECT. IMMUN.in osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes strains JRS4, JRS145,and SAM1 were compared (Fig. 6). The levels of expression ofRANKL mRNA in osteoblasts infected with these strains werefour- to fivefold greater than the levels of expression in un-stimulated osteoblasts. Thus, the presence of M6 protein orprotein F1 of S. pyogenes was not found to be essential forRANKL expression in infected osteoblasts.S. pyogenes infection results in phosphorylation of the mouseosteoblast p38 MAPK. It was reported previously that infectionby several pathogens induces phosphorylation of several typesof MAPKs. Western blot analysis with antibodies specific foractivated forms of MAPKs was performed to study down-stream signaling that allowed the synthesis of RANKL. Osteo-blasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 at an MOI of 10:1 exhib-ited an increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 7A).Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK demon-strated that p38 MAPK was phosphorylated for 60 min follow-ing infection. The phosphorylation of two other MAPKs,ERK1/2 and JNK, was examined in the same infected osteo-blasts. As shown in Fig. 7B, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 wasFIG. 2.

The level of phos-phorylation did not change during the infection period. Incontrast to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation ofJNK was not detectable (Fig. 7B). Western blotting with anti-bodies against total JNK suggested that the lower-molecular-mass JNK protein (46 kDa) was not present in osteoblasts,because only a higher-molecular-mass protein (54 kDa) wasvisible. Treatment of osteoblasts with the p38 MAPK inhibitorSB203580 (5 \ufffdM) resulted in a reduction in RANKL mRNAexpression in osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 (Fig.8). These results suggested that phosphorylation of p38 MAPKis involved in the up-regulation of RANKL expression in os-teoblasts infected with S. pyogenesDISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated for the first time that viable S.pyogenes is a potent stimulant in induction of RANKL produc-tion by osteoblasts. S. pyogenes infection induced transcrip-tional regulation of the RANKL gene. An increase in RANKLmRNA was detectable 3 h after infection, and there was a four-to fivefold increase 6 h after infection. RANKL is a potentcytokine that stimulates differentiation of osteoclasts togetherwith macrophage colony-stimulating factor (18, 27, 34). Thiscytokine is produced by activated osteoblasts, as well as byactivated T cells, and is an activating agent involved in bonedestruction (17, 18, 27, 28, 34). Since RANKL-deficient miceshow severe osteopetrosis, RANKL appears to be essential inosteoclastogenesis (18). Furthermore, Kotake et al. (19) re-ported that RANKL is involved in bone destruction in patientswith rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we have found that S.pyogenes infection induces bacterial arthritis in mice; in theinfected joints, significant increases in the level of RANKL, aswell as in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\ufffd andIL-6, were observed (submitted for publication). Therefore,RANKL in infected joints may lead to bone destruction inbacterial septic arthritis.RT-PCR revealed that S. pyogenes infection induced up-regulation of the mRNAs of both IL-6 and TGF-\ufffd (Fig. 2).Both of these cytokines are involved in osteoclastogenesis andstimulate osteoclast formation and differentiation (14, 27).With regard to cytokine production by osteoblasts, infection byviable S. aureus was reported to induce granulocyte-macroph-age colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and IL-12 expression byhuman and mouse osteoblasts (4, 5). IL-6 and IL-12 producedby infected osteoblasts should play an important role in initi-ating immune responses after S. aureus infection in osteomy-elitis. Together with these findings, the results described hereprovide evidence that cytokines produced by osteoblasts maycontribute to the inflammatory reactions in the joints duringseptic arthritis. Experimental septic arthritis induced by S. au-reus and group B S. agalactiae accompanies an increase in thelocal synthesis of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\ufffd (30, 32), but thesignificance of RANKL in arthritis has not been examined.This is simply because RANKL was discovered only recently.Further investigations should be performed to establish theFIG. 5.

IMMUN.role of RANKL in septic arthritis and other inflammatory bonediseases.Nakagawa et al. (21) reported that invasion of epithelial cellsby S. pyogenes triggers apoptosis of the infected cells. Thisapoptosis is strongly related to the F1-mediated invasion, be-cause F1-deficient isogenic mutant strain SAM1 does not in-duce apoptosis of infected cells. Induction of apoptosis re-quires a higher S. pyogenes MOI. We found that infection by S.pyogenes at a higher MOI, such as 50:1, also resulted in deathof osteoblasts (data not shown). We found in this study that S.pyogenes JRS4 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd) adhered to and invaded osteoblasticcells. Since the invasive ability of SAM1 was weak (Fig. 5), theprotein F1 molecule may play an important role in invasion ofosteoblasts, as well as epithelial cells, by S. pyogenes. However,expression of RANKL mRNA did not change in SAM1-in-fected or JRS145 (M6\ufffd F1\ufffd)-infected osteoblasts (Fig. 6),suggesting that adhesion or invasion is not a key step in induc-ing up-regulation of RANKL. These results suggest that theability of S. pyogenes to attach and the ability of S. pyogenes toinvade are not relevant for RANKL induction.How does S. pyogenes induce RANKL production in osteo-blasts? It was reported previously that adherence of S. pyogenestriggers a proinflammatory response in keratinocytes (33). In-fection of mouse and human osteoblasts by S. aureus was foundto induce IL-6 and IL-12 production (4). The production ofthese cytokines may be related to internalization of S. aureus inthe osteoblasts, because UV-killed S. aureus was not a potentinducer of the cytokines. In this study, we also found thatheat-inactivated S. pyogenes did not function as a potent in-ducer of RANKL production (Fig. 4D). At this time, however,it is difficult to claim that bacterial internalization per se trig-gers the cytokine production in the osteoblasts, because F1-deficient mutant SAM1 induced RANKL production compa-rable to that induced by the parent strain. In addition, culturesupernatant of S. pyogenes JRS4 did not stimulate expressionof RANKL mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, an unknownnovel cell-associated molecule(s) of S. pyogenes may triggercytokine production. It was reported previously that streptol-ysin O from S. pyogenes and listeriolysin O from Listeria mono-cytogenes induce production of proinflammatory cytokines inkeratinocytes (25) and phosphorylation of MAPK in HeLacells (29), respectively. In addition to streptolysin O, extracel-lular cysteine proteases from S. pyogenes have been reported toinduce proinflammatory responses in mammalian cells (6). Thepossible involvement of these exotoxins in cytokine productionis now under investigation.A recent study suggested that various bacterial components,FIG. 7. Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and other signal proteins. Osteoblasts were infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 for0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at an MOI of 10. The phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK (A) and the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 and JNK(B) were analyzed by Western blotting by using antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK, total p38 MAPK, totalERK1/2, and total JNK.FIG. 8. SB203580-mediated inhibition of RANKL mRNA expres-sion in osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes. Osteoblasts were prein-cubated (1 h, 37\u00b0C) with SB203580 at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, and 5\ufffdM and then infected with S. pyogenes (MOI, 10) for 6 h at 37\u00b0C.RANKL mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR. The resultswere expressed as fold increases compared with the RANKL mRNAlevels in osteoblasts cultured without stimulants. The values are themeans \ufffd standard deviations for triplicate assays. An asterisk indicatesthat the P value was \ufffd0.05 for a comparison with the RANKL mRNAlevel in the cells infected with S. pyogenes in the absence of SB203580.VOL. 71, 2003 STREPTOCOCCI INDUCE RANKL PRODUCTION IN OSTEOBLASTS 953such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acids, pepti-doglycans, and lipoproteins, bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs)on a wide range of eukaryotic cells (1). Such binding leads toactivation of NF-\ufffdB signaling pathways and to the release ofboth inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (1). Kiku-chi et al. (16) reported that LPS of gram-negative bacteriainduces RANKL gene expression in mouse osteoblasts viaTLR4. They suggested that RANKL expression via the TLRpathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis ofLPS-mediated bone disorders. By using RT-PCR, we alsofound here that osteoblasts expressed mRNAs for TLR2,TLR4, and TLR5 (data not shown). Several bacterial compo-nents, such as M protein, peptidoglycan, or lipoteichoic acid ofS. pyogenes, may bind to the TLRs and activate the signalpathways in the osteoblasts. However, neither heat-inactivatedwhole cells of S. pyogenes nor bacterial culture supernatant ofS. pyogenes induced RANKL expression in osteoblasts. Theseresults suggest that the pathway to RANKL expression in os-teoblasts infected with S. pyogenes is not identical to that inosteoblasts stimulated by LPS of gram-negative bacteria. Inaddition, it has been reported that heat-inactivated S. pyogenesis able to induce TNF-\ufffd production in human monocytes (10).The cellular responses of osteoblasts to heat-inactivated S.pyogenes may be different from those of monocytes.It has been recognized that MAPKs are key players in manyhost cell signaling pathways (8). MAPKs are involved in cyto-kine responses, cytoskeletal reorganization, and stress re-sponses. Involvement of MAPKs in S. pyogenes infection hasnot been demonstrated yet. In the present study, we found thatinfection of S. pyogenes resulted in activation of the intracel-lular p38 MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 7). In this regard,Ellington et al. (11) reported recently that infection by S.aureus induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in osteoblasts.They also reported that S. aureus infection induces IL-6 andIL-12 production in osteoblasts. On the other hand, we foundthat spontaneous phosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurs in osteo-blasts. The role of ERK1/2 in cytokine production in osteo-blasts is still unclear. It is possible that S. aureus triggers IL-6and IL-12 production via ERK1/2 pathways, whereas S. pyo-genes induces RANKL production via p38 MAPK pathways. Inthis regard, the p38 MAPK pathway was reported to regulateIL-6 synthesis in the MG-63 osteoblastic cell line in response toTNF-\ufffd (7). Although it is possible that S. pyogenes and S.aureus stimulate independent signal pathways, the detailed sig-nal pathways involved in infection by these two bacterial spe-cies require further investigation.Stimulation of local RANKL and other inflammatory medi-ators is an important event in bone destruction (17, 18, 19, 27,28, 30). Clinically, infection by S. pyogenes causes two bonediseases. One is a septic arthritis, and the other is a poststrep-tococcal reactive arthritis. Infiltration of immune cells, such asT and B cells, production of inflammatory cytokines, such asIL-1, and production of inflammatory mediators, such asPGE2, may be associated with these diseases. However, acti-vation of osteoblasts in infected bone tissue may be anotherimportant event. RANKL produced by activated osteoblastsinduces osteoclast differentiation or osteoclast-mediated boneresorption. IL-6 and TGF-\ufffd can directly or indirectly modulatethe activity of bone-resorptive osteoclasts (14, 27). The in-creased production of these cytokines by infected osteoblastsmay play important roles in septic arthritis and poststreptococ-cal arthritis. Other inflammatory responses may be mediated inosteoblasts through infection by S. pyogenes. Techniques suchas DNA microarray analysis should enable definition of genesthat are regulated in response to S. pyogenes infection. Suchinformation should be useful in treating diseases such as septicarthritis and poststreptococcal arthritis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research12672026 and 14207074 from the Japan Society for the Promotion ofScience, by health science research grant H12-shinko-27, and by agrant from Japan Science and Technology Corporation.REFERENCES1.
