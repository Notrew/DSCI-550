"STIM1, a direct target of microRNA-185, promotes tumor metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancerOPENORIGINAL ARTICLESTIM1, a direct target of microRNA-185, promotes tumormetastasis and is associated with poor prognosis incolorectal cancerZ Zhang1, X Liu1, B Feng1, N Liu1, Q Wu, Y Han, Y Nie, K Wu, Y Shi and D FanSTIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor that triggers the store-operated Ca2+ entry activation,has recently been implicated in cancer progression. However, the role of STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of colorectalcancer (CRC) has not been addressed. In this study, we confirmed increased expression of STIM1 in highly invasive CRC cell lines.Enhanced expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing of STIM1 with small interferingRNA resulted in reduced metastasis. Ectopic expression of STIM1 in CRC cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),whereas silencing of STIM1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, STIM1 expression was markedly higher in CRC tissues than inadjacent noncancerous tissues. STIM1 overexpression correlated with poor differentiation and higher tumor node metastasis stage.CRC patients with positive STIM1 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative STIM1 expression. Moreover, STIM1was found to be a direct target of miR-185, a microRNA (miRNA) that has not previously been reported to be involved in EMT, inboth CRC tissues and cell lines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that STIM1 promotes metastasis and isassociated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, we show that expression of STIM1 isregulated by a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by a new EMT-related miRNA. This novel miR-185\u2013STIM1 axispromotes CRC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.Oncogene (2015) 34, 4808\u20134820; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.404; published online 22 December 2014INTRODUCTIONColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent carcinomasthroughout the world, with an estimated one million new casesand half a million mortalities each year.1,2 Metastasis, one of thesix initial cancer hallmarks,3 is a major cause of CRC-associatedmortality.4 More than one-third of patients with CRC will ultimatelydevelop metastatic disease;5 however, little is known about theexact molecular mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis.6 Under-standing the key factors in these processes is crucial to thedevelopment of novel anticancer therapies.In most types of cell, the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is acritical regulator that mediates various cellular processes.7 In non-excitable cells, the store-operated calcium influx (SOCE) is themajor mechanism of Ca2+ entry.8,9 Recent studies have identifiedtwo important molecules responsible for SOCE activation: STIM1(stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1.8 When Ca2+ in theendoplasmic reticulum is depleted, STIM1 serves as a Ca2+ sensorand aggregates into multiple punctae that translocate within closeproximity of the plasma membranes.10 Orai1, an essential pore-forming component of the SOCE channel, translocates to theseSTIM1-containing structures during store depletion and openstomediate Ca2+ entry.11\u201313 Recently, STIM1 has been reported tohave an important role in various pathophysiological conditions,such as the immune response,11,14 cardiovascular disease,15,16sexual dysfunction17 and pulmonary disease.18 STIM1 was alsofound to be involved in cancer and was initially thought to workas a tumor suppressor,19 although subsequent data indicate anopposite function.20 More recently, Orai1 and STIM1 were shownto be essential for the migration of breast tumor cells.21 Anotherstudy found that STIM1 has an important role in the growth,migration and angiogenesis of cervical cancer.22 These studiessuggest that STIM1 might have a critical role in cancer.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogeneticprocess in which cells lose their epithelial characteristics such ascell polarity and cell\u2013cell contact, and gain mesenchymal proper-ties such as increased motility. EMT also endows cells with invasiveproperties, induces stem cell properties and prevents apoptosisand senescence. Morphologic evidence of EMT has been found atthe invasive front of human tumors.23 EMT is viewed as anessential early step and a critical process during tumormetastasis.24\u201327 Notably, several recent studies suggest that EMTinitiated by Oct4 or Snail1 in breast cancer may be associated withSTIM1-directed Ca2 influx.21,23,28\u201330 These studies strongly suggestthat STIM1 may promote cancer metastasis by regulating EMT.MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that posttran-scriptionally regulate protein expression.31 Several studies haveshown that miRNAs have an important role in cancer metastasis.32Recently, some studies have highlighted the importance ofmiRNAs in the regulation of EMT.33,34 As both miRNAs and STIM1may have important roles in EMT process, we are interested inwhether STIM1 expression is regulated by certain miRNAs incancer. Notably, a recent study has found that miR-195 directlyregulates STIM1 mRNA decay in normal rat intestinal crypt cells.35However,whether posttranscriptional regulation by certainState Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.Correspondence: Professor Y Shi or Professor D Fan, State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, 127Chang Le West Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, People's Republic of China.E-mail: shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cn or daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn1These authors contributed equally to this work.Received 15 November 2013; revised 21 October 2014; accepted 4 November 2014; published online 22 December 2014Oncogene (2015) 34, 4808\u20134820\u00a9 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-9232/15www.nature.com/onchttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2014.404mailto:shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cnmailto:daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn) (DF)http://www.nature.com/oncmiRNAs may represent one of the upstream regulation mechan-isms of STIM1 expression in cancer metastasis remains unknown.In this study, we provide the first evidence that STIM1overexpression is associated with progression and poor prognosisin CRC.

The SW480 cell line was obtained from aprimary CRC lesion, and the SW620 cell line was established from alymph node (LN) metastasis in the same patient a year later.36Figure 2.

SW480 cells were infected withrecombinant lentivirus expressing STIM1 (LV-STIM1) or a controllentivirus (LV-NC) and stable clones were established(SW480-STIM1c1, SW480-STIM1c2 and SW480-NC, respectively;Figure 1b). Upregulation and knockdown of STIM1 expressionwas confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 1b). Transwellassays showed that downregulation of STIM1 expression inSW620 cells markedly decreased cell migration and invasion(Figures 1c1 and c2). Conversely, upregulation of STIM1 expressionin SW480 cells significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion(Figures 1d1 and d2). MTT (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to excludethe contribution of cell proliferation (Supplementary Figures S1Aand B).These results suggest that STIM1 promotes metastasis inCRC cells.To further explore the role of STIM1, we injected SW480-STIM1c1, SW480-STIM1c2, SW620-STIM1si1 or SW620-STIM1si2cells into nude mice through the lateral tail vein. Histologicanalyses (Figures 2c1 and c2) confirmed that the incidence of lungand liver metastases was markedly increased in mice injected withSW480-STIM1c1 or SW480-STIM1c2 cells and markedly decreasedin mice injected with SW620-STIM1si1 or SW620-STIM1si2 cells,compared with the control group. The number of metastatic lungand liver nodules was significantly increased in the SW480-STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c2 groups and significantly decreasedin the SW620-STIM1si1 and SW620-STIM1si2 groups, comparedwith the control group (Figures 2a, b1 and b2).200\ufffd 400\ufffd100\u00b5m100\u00b5m100\u00b5m2018161412108642014121086420Upregulation of STIM1 in CRC tissuesSTIM1stainingTumor(90)PositiveNagetive6327 7119 P<0.001Adjacentnontumor(90) P valueStaining score of immunostainingRelative mRNA expressionRelative aboundance intumors#**86420Noncancerousregion of CRCAdjacent nontumorLN positiveSTIM1STIM1 negativeSTIM1 positivePercent survival100806040200Month after operation(m)0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80LN negativeCRCNon-metastaticCRCMetastaticCRCFigure 4.

During the EMTprocess, differentiated polarized epithelial cells undergo profoundmorphogenetic changes, typified by the dissolution of cell\u2013celljunctions and loss of apicobasolateral polarity, resulting in theformation of migratory mesenchymal cells with invasive proper-ties. Moreover, during this process the expression of epithelialmarkers (such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin) is downregulated,whereas the expression of mesenchymal markers (such asvimentin and fibronectin) is upregulated.38,39By comparing the morphology of the cell models describedabove under a light microscope, we observed that ectopicexpression of STIM1 in SW480 cells induced the conversion ofpolarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-likemesenchymal cells with the loss of cell\u2013cell adhesion, whereasknockdown of STIM1 in SW620 cells resulted in a tighterorganization of cells in colonies and an epithelioid morphology(Figure 3a).Next, we assessed the expression of EMT markers in these cellmodels. Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription\u2013PCR (qRT\u2013PCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in theexpression of vimentin and fibronectin and a significant increasein the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin in SW620-STIM1si1and SW620-STIM1si1 cells, compared with control cells. Conver-sely, a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin andan increase in the expression of vimentin and fibronectin wereobserved in SW480-STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c1 cells, comparedwith control cells (Figures 3b and c). These changes in E-cadherinand vimentin expression were confirmed by an immunofluores-cent assay (Figure 3d). These results suggest that STIM1 is criticalfor the acquisition of EMT characteristics and may contribute tothe EMT-derived invasive phenotype in CRC cells.STIM1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues andindicates poor prognosisTo explore the potential role of STIM1 in determining the clinicaloutcome of CRC, we assessed STIM1 expression in a tissuemicroarray of 90 CRC patients. The results of immunohistochem-ical staining showed that STIM1 was localized to both thecytoplasm and membranes. Positive STIM1 expression wasdetected in 63 of 90 (71.1%) primary CRC samples comparedwith only 19 of 90 (21.1%) adjacent non-tumor tissues. Theseresults were confirmed by scoring the staining intensity across thesection (Figures 4A1\u20133). These findings indicated that STIM1 wassignificantly overexpressed in human CRC tissues. To investigatethe correlation between STIM1 overexpression and CRCmetastasis, we compared STIM1 expression in 10 pairs of LNmetastasis-positive (LN-positive group) and LN metastasis-negative (LN-negative group) primary CRC specimens. Real-timePCR analysis showed that STIM1 mRNA levels were much higher inthe LN-positive group than in the LN-negative group (Figure 4C).Furthermore, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that patients withpositive STIM1 expression had shorter overall survival than thosewho were negative for STIM1 expression (Figure 4D). Toinvestigate whether STIM1 expression is associated with theprogression of CRC, we investigated the expression of STIM1 in anadditional 40 fresh CRC tissues by qRT\u2013PCR (Figure 4B) andcompared the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics ofthe patients. The results showed that overexpression of STIM1 didnot correlate with age, gender or tumor size (P40.05), but wassignificantly associated with TNM stage and LN status (Po0.01;Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the expressionlevel of STIM1 positively correlated with the progression of CRCand that STIM1 overexpression is indicative of poor prognoses ofhuman CRC patients following curative resection.The expression of miR-185 inversely correlates with the expressionof STIM1 in CRC cells and is associated with the progression of CRCThe above results indicated that STIM1 overexpression might havea critical role in CRC. However, there have been few studies on theregulation of STIM1 expression in cancer. miRNAs were recentlyfound to have an important role in tumor progression throughtheir function as posttranscriptional regulators. We hypothesizedthat posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs may represent oneof the upstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression. Totest this idea, we used several web-based target analysis tools(TargetScan, miRanda, RNAhybrid, pictar and DIANAmT) to identifymiRNAs that potentially target STIM1. As a result, miR-185 wasidentified as a potential regulator of STIM1 expression (Figure 5a).This was consistent with the results of our previous miRNAmicroarray analysis, which identified miR-185 as the mostsignificantly downregulated miRNA in SW620 cells compared withSW480 cells.36 Therefore, miR-185 was selected for further study.We examined endogenous miR-185 expression levels in fourhuman CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT29 and LOVO) and in anormal human intestinal epithelial cell line by qRT\u2013PCR. Theexpression levels of miR-185 were significantly decreased inSW620 and LOVO cell lines (highly metastatic cells) compared witheither poorly metastatic or immortalized cells. miR-185 expressionnegatively correlated with the metastatic potential of the CRC cells(Figure 5b1). Furthermore, the expression of miR-185 and STIM1was inversely correlated (Figure 5b2). To investigate the correla-tion of miR-185 with STIM1 expression levels in CRC tissues, weused qRT\u2013PCR to measure the expression levels of miR-185 in the40 CRC tissues previously described. Our results confirmed thatthe mRNA level of miR-185 negatively correlated with STIM1expression (Figure 5c2). The correlation of miR-185 expressionwith clinicopathologic factors was also examined. In contrast toSTIM1 expression, low expression levels of miR-185 weresignificantly associated with advanced clinical tumor nodemetastasis stage and LN metastasis (Po0.001). miR-185 expres-sion levels in CRC patients did not correlate with age, gender,tumor size or cell differentiation (P40.05) (Table 2).

Successful upregulation ofmiR-185 expression was confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR (Figure 6a1).Increased miR-185 expression resulted in significant inhibition ofmigration and invasion in SW620 cells (Figures 6a2 and a3). Todetermine whether the loss of miR-185 promotes the migration orinvasion of CRC cells, miR-185 was silenced in SW480 cells with anantisense oligonucleotide inhibitor (Figure 6b1). This inhibition ofmiR-185 significantly promoted cell migration and invasion(Figures 6b2 and b3). These results indicate that miR-185 repressesthe invasive potential of CRC cells. As STIM1 has been shown topromote EMT in CRC cells and miR-185 has been predicted as apotential regulator of STIM1, we hypothesized that miR-185 mayexert an opposite effect on the regulation of EMT in CRC cells. Totest this, we compared the morphology of our cell models under alight microscope, and found that upregulating the expression ofmiR-185 in SW620 cells induced a tighter organization of cells incolonies, whereas downregulating the expression of miR-185 inSW480 cells led to a more fibroblast-like mesenchymal cellmorphology (Figure 3c).

Toobtain additional direct evidence that STIM1 expression isregulated by miR-185, we analyzed the binding site of miR-185in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of STIM1 and performed aluciferase reporter assay. An STIM1 3\u2032-UTR reporter (Luc-STIM1) orthe corresponding mutant reporter (Luc-STIM1-mu) was co-transfected with miR-185 mimics or mimic controls into SW620cells. As expected, the luciferase activities of the reporterconstructs were reduced significantly only when miR-185 mimicswere co-transfected with Luc-STIM1 in SW620 cells. No apparentchange in luciferase activities was observed in cells transfectedwith Luc-STIM1-mu or mimic controls (Figure 7a). To confirmwhether targeting of the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR by miR-185 was functional,SW620 cells transfected with miR-185 mimics and SW480 cellstransfected with the miR-185 inhibitor were analyzed by qRT\u2013PCRand western blotting. Both mRNA (Figure 7b1) and protein(Figure 7b2) levels of STIM1 were markedly upregulated in SW480cells transfected with the miR-185 inhibitor, whereas both mRNA(Figure 7c1) and protein (Figure 7c2) levels of STIM1 wereeffectively downregulated in SW620 cells transfected with themiR-185 mimic. Further experiments confirmed that the alteredmiR-185 expression does not affect the expression of STIM2,Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3, which may also be involved in SOCE(Supplementary Figures S2A and B). These results suggest thatSTIM1 is a direct functional target of miR-185. To furthercorroborate this hypothesis, we performed a \u2018rescue\u2019 experimentby co-transfecting SW620 cells with miR-185 mimics and apcDNA3.1 vector carrying an STIM1 expression cassette(pcDNA3.1-STIM1) or mutated seed sequences of miR-185 at theSTIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu). Western blot analysis demonstratedthat co-transfection of SW620 cells with the miR-185 mimic andSTIM1-mu restored STIM1 protein expression, whereas co-transfection with pcDNA3.1-STIM1 failed to recover the STIM1expression that was silenced by the miR-185 mimic. Furthermore,restoration of STIM1 expression by the introduction of STIM1-muinto SW620 cells transfected with the miR-185 mimics inhibitedthe expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and increased theexpression of vimentin and fibronectin (Figure 7d). In addition,rescuing STIM1 expression in the presence of the miR-185 mimicsenhanced the invasion and migration potential of SW620 cells(Figure 7e). Moreover, to determine the effect of the miR-185\u2013STIM1 axis on SOCE, we examined cellular Ca2+ distribution byCa2+ imaging in both SW620 and SW480 cells. After ER Ca2+depletion, Ca2+ influx through SOCE into SW620 cells wasincreased compared with SW480 cells (Supplementary FiguresS3A and B). We then examined the effect of overexpression ofmiR-185 and found that SOCE was impaired in SW620\u2013miR-185mimic cells (Supplementary Figures S3C and D), whereasinhibition of miR-185 in SW480 cells moderately increasedSOCE (Supplementary Figures S3E and F). Taken together, theseresults suggest that STIM1 is a potential functional target ofmiR-185.In summary, our results suggest that STIM1 is a direct functionaltarget of miR-185 and that this novel miR-185/STIM1 axis has animportant role in the regulation of CRC metastasis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that STIM1 promotes CRCmetastasis. The upregulation of STIM1 in CRC is at least partlyattributed to posttranscriptional regulation by miR-185, a novelEMT-regulating miRNA. Additionally, we provide evidence sup-porting the involvement of STIM1 in the regulation of EMT incancer.The influx of Ca2+ is essential for the migration of tumorcells.40,41 STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, regulatesCa2+ influx by activating SOCE.11,12 STIM1 has recently beenproposed to be a critical molecule in the regulation of cancermetastasis,21,22 although the exact role of STIM1 in metastasisremains controversial. STIM1 was initially implicated as anantimetastasis molecule.19 However, we found that STIM1promoted migration and invasive properties in CRC, and thatincreased expression of STIM1 in CRC was significantly associatedwith cancer metastasis. In accordance with our study, STIM1 wasreported to be one of the molecules essential for breast tumor cellmigration in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.21 Similarly, anotherstudy demonstrated that the level of STIM1 was significantlyassociated with the risk of metastasis in cervical cancer. Moreover,epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration in cervical cancercells requires STIM1 expression.22 Our results provide newevidence supporting the involvement of STIM1 in the promotionof cancer metastasis.It has been reported that expression of constitutively active Rasovercomes the migration-inhibitory function of the Ca2+ influxinhibitor and STIM1 siRNA in breast cancer.21 Interestingly,a previous study has shown that activation of the Ras signalingpathway leads to activation of the transcriptional regulator,Snail1,28 which appears to have a major role in EMT.23,29 Thesestudies strongly suggest that STIM1 might promote cancermetastasis by regulating the EMT. In this study, we demonstratedthat knockdown of STIM1 induced the conversion of spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells to polarized epithelialTable 2.

Moreover,increased levels of STIM1 correlated with a high metastaticpotential of CRC cells. In accordance with our findings, a previousstudy also showed that STIM1 was significantly associated with therisk of metastasis in cervical cancer.22 Based on these findings,elucidating the mechanism of STIM1 upregulation may contributeto the identification of new cancer therapy targets. A recent studydemonstrated that the expression of STIM1 is regulated by Wilmstumor suppressor 1 and early growth response 1 in six specificcancer subtypes.42 Another study reported that STIM1 is regulatedby androgens in prostate stromal cells. However, these observa-tions are not sufficient to explain the mechanism behind theupregulation of STIM1 in cancer. A recent study found thatanother STIM protein, STIM2, inversely control melanoma growthand invasion,43 suggesting that STIM proteins, including STIM1and STIM2, have critical roles in cancer. Interestingly, these STIMproteins may exert different and even opposite functions indifferent kinds of cancers, which imply complex and importantroles in cancer. Further study on STIM family may provide newtargets for cancer therapy.miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of tumormetastasis32 and recent studies have highlighted the importanceof miRNAs in the regulation of the EMT.33,34 To explore whetherposttranscriptional regulation by certain miRNAs is one of theupstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression, we usedseveral target prediction algorithms to assay for miRNA bindingsites in the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR. miRNA-185 was identified by severalalgorithms. Surprisingly, our previous miRNA microarray analysisrevealed that miR-185 was the most significantly downregulatedmiRNA in SW620 cells (highly metastatic) compared with SW480cells (poorly metastatic).36 In this study, we found that miR-185expression inversely correlated with the expression of STIM1 inboth CRC cells and tissues, and that transfection with miR-185significantly downregulated the expression of STIM1. These resultswere further confirmed by luciferase activity assays. miR-185 wasrecently found to be an independent prognostic factor in gastriccancer44 and hepatocellular carcinoma.45 Moreover, miR-185 caninduce cell cycle arrest and repress cell proliferation in non-small-cell lung cancer,46 colorectal cancer,47 glioma,48 gastric cancer49and breast cancer.50 miR-185 has also been reported to beinvolved in metastasis in colorectal cancer51 and glioma.48However, the role of miR-185 in the pathophysiological functionsof STIM1 has not previously been reported.The results presented here show that upregulating theexpression of miR-185 inhibited migration and invasion andreversed the EMT in CRC cells. Our data further indicate thatSTIM1 is a functional target of miR-185 in CRC. Taken together,these findings provide new insight into the mechanism of theregulation of STIM1 expression at the posttranscriptional level,although further studies are required to fully understand themechanism by which the miR-185-STIM1 pathway regulates EMTin cancer.In conclusion, we have demonstrated a critical function ofSTIM1 in promoting CRC metastasis. This study also reveals a newregulatory mechanism of STIM1 expression by miR-185, an miRNAnot previously associated with the EMT process. We believe thatthe miR-185-STIM1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeuticintervention against cancer metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell cultureThe human CRC cell lines were preserved in our institute and wereroutinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA)supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA),100 U/ml penicillin sodium and 100mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 \u00b0C ina humidified air atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Throughoutthe experiment, cells were used in the logarithmic phase of growthaccording to the supplier\u2019s instructions.Clinical samplesSamples from 40 CRC patients (23 males and 17 females) who hadundergone proctocolectomy with LN dissection for CRC at Xijing Hospital(Xi'an, China) between November 2008 and April 2009 were included inthe study (Supplementary Table S2). None of the patients receivedpreoperative chemotherapy. The resected specimens were histologicallyexamined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The primary tumor samplesand corresponding non-tumor mucosa were collected from each patientimmediately after the surgical process and were snap frozen in liquidnitrogen until further use. Total RNA from the frozen tissues was isolatedwith TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions.Oligonucleotide construction, lentivirus production and constructdesignAn miR-185 mimic, an inhibitor and a negative control oligonucleotideswere purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Transfection ofoligonucleotides was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. On the basis of the STIM1sequence, three short hairpin RNAs were designed using the siRNA TargetFinder (InvivoGene, San Diego, CA, USA): 5\u2032-GGGAAGACCTCAATTACCA-3\u2032,5\u2032-TCTCCACATTTGGATTCTT-5\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGATGATGTAGATCATAA-3\u2032. Lenti-viral vectors encoding short haipin RNAs were generated using GV248vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). Stable transfectantsoverexpressing STIM1 were generated by lentiviral transduction using aGV166 vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd). An empty vector was used as thenegative control.STIM1-expressing vector with miR-185 binding sites or mutated seedsequences of miR-185 at STIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu) was purchased fromOpen Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA) and was subcloned into theeukaryotic expression vector.Luciferase assayLuc-STIM1 vector.
