This locus was designated ETT2 (E. coli type III secretion 2) andconsisted of the epr, epa, and eiv genes. ETT2 was found in enteropathogenic E. coli strains and also in somenon-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains, but most of them contained a truncated portion ofETT2. Most O157 isolates had a complete collection of toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA and the ETT2 locus,while most O26 strains had toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA genes but an incomplete ETT2 locus. Thus, anintact copy of ETT2 might mark a pathogenic distinction for particular STEC strains. Therefore, the presenceof the ETT2 locus can be used for identification of truly pathogenic STEC strains and for molecular finger-printing of the epidemic strains in humans and animals.Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Shiga tox-in-producing E. coli (STEC) are the most common causes ofhemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic-uremicsyndrome and also cause food-borne epidemics in humans(19). STEC is distributed widely in the environment (1, 2). Itproduces cytotoxin as the main virulence factor but can have ahistopathologic effect on intestinal epithelial cells, causing at-taching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions. Enteropathogenic E. coli(EPEC), which is a major cause of infant diarrhea in develop-ing countries, has the same ability to cause A/E lesions. Theselesions are characterized by localized destruction of brush bor-der microvilli, intimate attachment of the organism to the hostcell membrane, and formation of an actin-rich underlyingstructure in the host cells (5). All genes necessary for theformation of A/E lesions are located in a pathogenicity islandtermed the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) (18). Thislocus contains genes for structural components of a secretionapparatus that belongs to the type III secretion system, that is,genes for the adhesin intimin and its translocated receptor, Tir(7).The type III secretion system, which is found in many gram-negative pathogens, is responsible for secretion and injectionof virulence-associated factors into the cytosol of host cells.The type III apparatus comprises approximately 20 proteins,with most of them located in the inner membrane (6, 24). Mostinner membrane proteins are homologous to components ofthe flagellar biosynthesis apparatuses of both gram-negativeand gram-positive bacteria (10). In Salmonella enterica serovarTyphimurium, two independent type III secretion systems en-coded by separate chromosomal loci, SPI-1 and SPI-2, havebeen found (8, 22). SPI-1 is required for the invasion of mam-malian cells, and SPI-2 is required for replication in macro-phages and for survival in mice.The release of the complete genome sequence of EHECO157:H7 (9) provided us with an opportunity to identify se-quences specific for STEC strains. In this study, we report ona type III secretion locus in the STEC chromosome similar tothe SPI-1 system. To estimate the roles of this locus in viru-lence expression in STEC, we show the distribution of thisnovel locus among various STEC strains, and we also discussthe transmission of STEC from animals to humans.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and media. Table 1 lists all STEC strains used in the study.EHEC O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952 (referred to here as EHEC O157 Sakai)was originally isolated from a patient in an outbreak in Sakai, Japan, in 1996 (14).Four EPEC isolates from humans were used in this study: B171-8 (O111:NM,where NM indicates nonmotile) (20), E2348/69 (O127:H7), 4394-57 (O114:NM),and 1929-55(O126:NM). Some STEC strains were isolated from deer (1), sheep(2), seagulls (2), houseflies (11), and salmon roe (15). Other STEC and EPECstrains are the stock isolates in our laboratory. Bacteria were cultured in Tryp-ticase soy broth (BBL/Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) or on Trypticase soyagar (BBL/Becton Dickinson).Southern hybridization. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from EHEC,EPEC, and E. coli K-12 strains as described previously (17) and digested withEcoRI. The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarosegels and were transferred to Hybond-N\ufffd positively charged nylon membranes(Amersham, Little Chalfont, England).

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.RESULTSStructure of a new locus that encodes a second type IIIsecretion system. Based on the DNA sequence of the EHECO157 Sakai chromosome, we searched for a DNA sequenceunique to EHEC O157 which was not present in the E. coliK-12 genome. One such sequence consisted of a 17-kb regioninserted between the sequences homologous to those at min 64and 65 of the E. coli K-12 chromosome (Fig. 1). The 17-kbinsert showed no significant homology with the E. coli K-12chromosome and contained 21 open reading frames (ORFs)(Table 4; Fig. 1). The G\ufffdC content of this region was 36.9%.The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF2 to ORF5 andORF7 to ORF20 were similar to those of proteins of the typeIII secretion system, which are required for the export of vir-ulence determinants in a variety of bacterial pathogens ofplants and animals. The predicted proteins of ORF2 to ORF5are similar in organization and sequences to the products ofthe prgH to prgK genes of Salmonella SPI-1. The predictedproteins of ORF7 to ORF20 are similar in organization andsequences to the products of the inv and spa genes of Salmo-nella SPI-1 but not to those of invB. They are also homologousto the mxi genes of Shigella flexneri (data not shown). Forexample, the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF2 is 53%identical to that of PrgK of S. enterica serovar Typhimuriumand 44% identical to that of MxiJ of S. flexneri 2a. The aminoacid sequences of ORF3 to ORF5 are similar to those of PrgJ(31% identical), PrgI (64%), and PrgH (31%), respectively, ofS. enterica serovar Typhimurium and to those of MxiI (32%),MxiH (58%), and MxiG (25%), respectively, of S. flexneri 2a.The entire organization and amino acid sequences of theORFs in this 17-kb region are closely related to those of SPI-1of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (Fig. 1). In addition tothese ORFs, the predicted protein of ORF1, which is locateddownstream of ORF2 and extends to the homologous se-quence in E. coli K-12, showed significant similarity to theTABLE 2.

ORF8 andORF9 showed significant similarity to SpaR of SPI-1, but theamino acid sequence of ORF9 was separated from ORF8,similar to the sequence in the C-terminal part of SpaR, byframe shifting in the ORF9-coding sequence. ORF5 was sim-ilar to PrgH in SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, butthe amino acid sequence corresponding to the N-terminal partof PrgH was lost from ORF5 because of the absence of theinitiation codon, even though the DNA sequence upstream ofFIG. 1.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.ORF5 showed a high degree of similarity to that of the se-quence upstream of the prgH gene in S. enterica serovar Ty-phimurium. Because of the high degree of similarity of eachORF to the genes in SPI-1 of Salmonella spp., the region fromORF5 to ORF2 was designated eprH to eprK, the region fromORF12 to ORF7 was designated epaO to epaS, and the regionfrom ORF19 to ORF13 was designated eivF to eivJ (Fig. 1).In SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the DNA be-tween spaS and prgH encodes secreted proteins, chaperones,and transcriptional regulatory proteins; but the region betweenepaS and eprH of EHEC O157 Sakai contains no ORF similarto these genes. Instead, ORF6 had a low, but significant degreeof similarity to several transcriptional regulatory proteins, in-cluding NtrC of Herbaspirillum seropedicae (25% identity and40% similarity in a 107-amino-acid overlap) and UhpA of S.enterica serovar Typhimurium (29% identity and 49% similar-ity in a 68-amino-acid overlap). Consequently, the 17-kb regionencodes the complete set of proteins for the type III secretionsystem apparatus but does not include the target or chaperoneproteins. This locus contains a set of genes for the type IIIsecretion system. Therefore, to distinguish this locus from a setof genes for type III secretion in LEE, we designated this locusETT2, for E. coli type III secretion locus 2.Conservation of ETT2 sequences among STEC strains. Toexamine the degree of conservation of the ETT2 sequenceamong pathogenic E. coli isolates from humans, Southern hy-bridization was performed with probes derived from the DNAcorresponding to eprH to eprK (probe A in Fig. 1; Table 2), epaOto epaS (probe B), and eivF to eivA (probe C). All seven EHECO157 strains had DNA sequences homologous to the sequenceof the ETT2 locus (Table 5). However, EHEC O26 strains fromhumans contained DNA sequences homologous to probes Aand B, but not to probe C (Table 5). The same pattern of hy-bridization observed with O26 was observed with four EPECstrains, but the DNA sequence that hybridized with ETT2-specific probes was not found in nonpathogenic strain E. coliHB101. To survey the distribution of the ETT2 locus amongvarious STEC isolates, a PCR was performed by using threeprimer sets specific for regions L, C, and D in the ETT2 locus(Fig. 1; Table 2). It was found that the results of the PCR co-incided with those of Southern hybridization (Tables 1 and 5).Thus, a PCR survey was undertaken to determine the dis-tribution of the ETT2 locus among 56 STEC isolates of variousorigins (Table 1). Sixteen STEC isolates had a complete ETT2locus of L, D, and C regions (Table 1); 15 isolates were sero-type O157, and one isolate, from a deer, was Out:H25 (whereOut represents all O antiserum negative). Although fourEPEC isolates and two O26 isolates had only an L region,according to PCR (Table 5), eight other STEC isolates werealso of this type (Table 1): four were O26 and four were O119ONT:H\ufffd (where ONT means some O antiserum positive butnot identified), O153:H\ufffd, and Out:H\ufffd. Eight STEC strains,including five O157 strains, had a complete L region and eithera C region or a D region. However, among these eight strains,STEC HI-7 and HI-N had complete L and C regions and a Dregion with a short insertion (Table 1). Six other STEC strainshad complete L and D regions but no C region (Table 1). TheETT2 locus was identified in O157 Sakai, and all O157 isolatesof human origin had a complete ETT2 locus. Each of the O157strains originating from a housefly, salmon roe, and six cattlealso had a complete ETT2 locus (Table 1; Fig. 2). However,FIG. 2.

In the presentstudy, the eae gene was classified by PCR and production ofintimin was determined by Western blotting analysis with anti-intimin antibody. O157 STEC isolates commonly had eae-\ufffd andproduced intimin, regardless of their origins (Table 1; Fig. 3).In addition, all O157 STEC isolates except MB1, of cattle ori-gin, had the hlyA gene. Among the other serotypes tested, O119and O26 isolates commonly had the eae-\ufffd gene and producedintimin (Table 1; Fig. 3). Among them, eight isolates had thehlyA gene; among them, five isolates had the complete L re-gion, eae, and hlyA. Most other STEC isolates had no eae geneand did not produce intimin (Table 1). STEC strains isolatedfrom seagulls, deer, and sheep belonged to this group (Table1).DISCUSSIONA secondary type III secretion system, which was designatedETT2 (E. coli type III secretion system 2), was found in EHECserotype O157:H7 isolates, in addition to the first system en-coded by the LEE locus. This ETT2 locus contains 19 ORFshighly homologous with the SPI-1 type III secretion system ofS. enterica serovar Typhimurium; the organization of thoseORFs was also similar to that of SPI-1. However, slight differ-ences from SPI-1 were found: (i) SpaR was separated into twoORFs, epaR1 and epaR2, in the ETT2 locus, and (ii) InvB andInvH were absent from the ETT2 locus (Table 1). In theSalmonella SPI-1 system, InvH is necessary for localization ofInvG onto the outer membrane, but it is not a component ofthe type III secretion apparatus (4), while the function of InvBremains unknown (6). Therefore, the ETT2 locus seems toencode a complete set of the type III secretion machinery.Indeed, the complete cloned sequence of ETT2 confers uponE. coli K-12 strain DH5-\ufffd the ability to secrete the EspBprotein (T. Tobe, unpublished data).In SPI-1, genes coding secreted (effector) proteins such assipBCDA, the chaperon sicP, and the regulator hilA were foundin the region between the spa and prg operons. Instead of thesegenes, ORF6, which had 40% similarity to the NtrC transcrip-tional regulator (23) of H. seropedicae, was found in ETT2(Fig. 1), consistent with the ORF6 product also being a tran-scriptional regulator. Genes encoding target secreted proteinsof the ETT2 locus may exist elsewhere on the O157 chromo-some, but we could not identify them. However, a search forother sequences unique to O157 would provide the informa-tion needed to identify those genes.In EPEC and O26 strains, the ETT2 locus was found on thechromosome, but the chromosomes of EHEC O157 strainscontained only half of the ETT2 locus. Therefore, the ETT2DNA segment of EPEC B171-8 (O111:NM) was isolated andits DNA sequence was determined (GenBank accession no.AB052736); it was also inserted at min 64.5 of the E. coli K-12chromosome and was highly homologous with the L region ofthe ETT2 sequence in EHEC O157 Sakai (Fig. 1). The se-quence corresponding to the eiv genes was absent from theETT2 loci in EPEC and EHEC O26 strains (Fig. 1). All humanSTEC isolates had a complete or partial ETT2 locus, andnotably, all O157 isolates had a complete ETT2 locus. Inter-estingly, those STEC and EPEC strains commonly had the Lregion with the epr and epa genes, suggesting that the ETT2locus, especially the L-region locus, might be essential for thepathogenicity of O157 STEC isolates, as might the otherknown virulence factors encoded by the eae and hlyA genes.Although the association of the ETT2 locus with virulence inSTEC was not clear, the pathogenicity of STEC might beestimated by PCR with the primer sets described in this study.For example, although non-O157 STEC strain S-8 had thecomplete ETT2 locus but not stx, eae, and hlyA, it might bepathogenic for humans. As O26 STEC strains AS1 and AS15were isolated from humans, only the L region might be essen-tial for pathogenicity. In this sense, strains KR1, H8-55, andIK2 from cattle would be virulent strains. Also, O157 strainslacking only the C region from five cattle also would be virulentfor humans. As an hlyA gene associated with pathogenicity wasencoded by a large plasmid, this gene would easily be lost.Therefore, as the hlyA gene would not be a good marker forthe estimation of virulence (21), O157 strains MB1, H5-26, andH8-87 might have originally been virulent. Finally, cattleshould be one of the main sources of infection for the trans-mission of STEC to humans. In this study, O157 isolates froma fly and salmon roe were closely similar to O157 isolates ofhuman origin. However, as the salmon roe was the food thatcaused the O157 outbreak in Japan (15) and the fly was caughton cow manure on a cattle farm (11), these results were notunexpected.The G\ufffdC content of the ETT2 sequence was very low(36.9%) compared with that of the E. coli chromosome(50.8%) (3), suggesting that the ETT2 locus has been acquiredlaterally. Furthermore, the high degree of similarity of ETT2 toFIG. 3. Western blotting analysis of intimin proteins from different STEC isolates. Western blotting was performed by using antiserum againstintimin encoded by eae-\ufffd. The results for representative STEC isolates are shown.2346 MAKINO ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium suggests that ETT2and SPI-1 may have originated from the same organism. How-ever, the biological function of the ETT2 locus in the patho-genicity of STEC is not clear. The ETT2 locus might partici-pate in the pathogenicity of these bacteria in a manner otherthan adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, as theETT2 locus is common in human STEC isolates, it would be agood marker for molecular epidemiological surveys of STECstrains pathogenic for humans.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ben Adler for critical suggestions on the manuscript.This work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry ofHealth, Labour and Welfare (Research on Emerging and Re-Emerg-ing Infectious Diseases), by a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research fromthe Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 12575029),and by a grant from The 21st Century COE Program (A-1), Ministryof Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.REFERENCES1.
