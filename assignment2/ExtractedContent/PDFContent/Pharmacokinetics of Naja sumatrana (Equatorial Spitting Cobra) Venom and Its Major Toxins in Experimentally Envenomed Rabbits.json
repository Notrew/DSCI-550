To date, however, pharmacokinetic reports on cobra venoms andtheir toxins are still relatively limited. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana(Equatorial spitting cobra) venom and its major toxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin), followingintravenous and intramuscular administration into rabbits.Principal findings: The serum antigen concentration-time profile of the N. sumatrana venom and its major toxins injectedintravenously fitted a two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics. The systemic clearance (91.3 ml/h), terminal phasehalf-life (13.6 h) and systemic bioavailability (41.9%) of N. sumatrana venom injected intramuscularly were similar to those ofN. sputatrix venom determined in an earlier study. The venom neurotoxin and cardiotoxin reached their peak concentrationswithin 30 min following intramuscular injection, relatively faster than the phospholipase A2 and whole venom (Tmax = 2 hand 1 h, respectively). Rapid absorption of the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin from the injection site into systemic circulationindicates fast onsets of action of these principal toxins that are responsible for the early systemic manifestation ofenvenoming. The more prominent role of the neurotoxin in N. sumatrana systemic envenoming is further supported by itssignificantly higher intramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m. = 81.5%) compared to that of the phospholipase A2 (Fi.m. = 68.6%) orcardiotoxin (Fi.m. = 45.6%). The incomplete absorption of the phospholipase A2 and cardiotoxin may infer the toxins\u2019affinities for tissues at the injection site and their pathological roles in local tissue damages through synergistic interactions.Conclusion/Significance: Our results suggest that the venom neurotoxin is absorbed very rapidly and has the highestbioavailability following intramuscular injection, supporting its role as the principal toxin in systemic envenoming.Citation: Yap MKK, Tan NH, Sim SM, Fung SY, Tan CH (2014) Pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana (Equatorial Spitting Cobra) Venom and Its Major Toxins inExperimentally Envenomed Rabbits.

InMalaysia, cobra bites appears to be one of the commonest causesof snake envenomation [4\u20136]. There are two species of commoncobras in Malaysia: Naja kaouthia and Naja sumatrana, both classifiedas Category 1 medically important venomous snake [2]. Of thesetwo Naja cobras, N. sumatrana is widely distributed in the PeninsulaMalaysia (including Singapore), and is also known as theEquatorial spitting cobra [8], one of the venom-spitting speciesin Southeast Asia that are able to cause venom ophthalmia.Clinically, cobra bites produce systemic envenomation syndromewith the characteristic neuromuscular paralysis, and local toxicitymanifested as severe tissue necrosis [2,6,9]. The characterizationsof different cobra venoms, however, are necessary for the betterunderstanding of cobra envenomation pathophysiology as thetoxin compositions in cobra venoms vary from species to species[10]. Recent venom profiling with the use of ion-exchange highperformance liquid chromatography has shown that the majortoxins of N. sumatrana venom comprise high abundance ofphospholipase A2 and three-finger toxins such as polypeptides ofneurotoxins and cardiotoxins [10]. These are toxins with variedbiological and physicochemical properties which make thecharacterizations of individual toxins warranted in order to gainbetter insights into the toxic effects of the whole venom. Theoptimization of snakebite management and the use of antivenomdepend greatly on the knowledge of the venom\u2019s composition,pharmacological activities, as well as its disposition in the body (i.e.pharmacokinetics). The pathophysiological and pharmacologicaleffects of snake envenomation are related to the absorption andPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002890&domain=pdfdistribution kinetics of venom toxins into the systemic circulation.Indeed, it has been reported that the serum concentrations ofvenom antigens in snakebite victims are well correlated with theseverity of systemic and local symptoms during the course ofenvenomation [11]. Although there have been some studies on thepharmacokinetics of snake venoms or toxins in animals [12\u201322], thehighly varied snake venom compositions, inconsistent animalmodels, different pharmacokinetic modelling make the convergenceof the data equivocal to have the pharmacokinetic parametersgeneralized across all snake species. To date, even within the Najagenus of cobras, the pharmacokinetic studies on their venoms werelimited to isolated toxins of Formosan cobra [12,21], a few Africancobra venoms and their alpha toxins [15] and N. sputatrix venom[22]. Information on the systemic bioavailability of cobra venomsand their toxins following envenomation is even scarcer in theliterature. There is therefore a need to define the pharmacokineticparameters of specific cobra venom and its toxins more meticulouslyfor better clinical correlation.In the present study, the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatranavenom and its three major types of toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxinand phospholipase A2) were investigated using double-sandwichELISA. This is the first report where the pharmacokinetics of acobra venom was investigated alongside the pharmacokinetics ofall its major types of toxins. The results will make it possible tointerpret the pharmacokinetics of the whole venom in the light ofthat of its major toxins, and to enable better understanding of thepathophysiological effects of the venom.MethodsEthical statementsAll experimental animals were handled in accordance toCIOMS guidelines on animal experimentation [23]. The exper-imental protocol on the animal study (2013-06-07/MOL/R/FSY)was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.Venom, reagents and separation mediaThe venom was a pooled sample obtained from three adult N.sumatrana captured in central Malaysia (Negeri Sembilan) and wassupplied by Snake Valley (Seremban, Malaysia).Resource S ion exchange column and HiTrap Protein A HPaffinity column were purchased from GE Healthcare (New Jersey,USA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conju-gate was obtained from Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan. LichrosphereWP 300 C18 reverse-phase column cartridge was purchased fromMerck, New Jersey, USA. iBlot Gel Transfer stacks and iBlotblotting system were supplied by Invitrogen. Sephadex G-25 gelbeads and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma \u2013 Aldrich(St. Louis, USA) or as stated in the methods.AnimalsThe animals used in this study (New Zealand white rabbits)were supplied by Chenur Supplier (Selangor, Malaysia). Theanimals were housed in Laboratory Animal Centre, Faculty ofMedicine, University of Malaya, and received water and food adlibitum.Purification of N. sumatrana toxinsThe major N. sumatrana venom toxins (phospholipase A2,neurotoxin and cardiotoxin) were isolated from the venom byResource S ion-exchange chromatography as described by Yap etal., 2011 [10]. The isolated phospholipase A2, neurotoxin andcardiotoxin (corresponds to peak 5, peak 7 and peak 8, respectivelyas reported in Yap et al., 2011 [10]) were further purified by C18reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tohomogeneity on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by protein identification using matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry, as described by Yap et al., 2011 [10].Production of IgG antibodies against N. sumatranavenom, venom phospholipase A2, neurotoxin andcardiotoxinPre-immune serum was collected and used as the control inELISA. In the first immunization, N. sumatrana venom (10 mg) orvenom toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2,respectively at 5 mg) dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) and mixed with anequal volume of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant, was injectedintramuscularly into the thigh of the rabbits (n = 3 for each group).For the subsequent immunizations, 20 mg of the venom or 10 mgof venom toxins were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2), respectively,mixed with an equal volume of Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant andinjected intramuscularly at multiple sites at the back of the rabbitfortnightly for 8 weeks. The immunogenicity and antibody titers ofinocula were monitored using indirect ELISA as described by Yapet al., 2011 [10]. The rabbits were bled by cardiac puncture 9 daysafter the final immunization as indicated by plateauing of antibodytiter on indirect ELISA.Purification of IgG and preparation of horseradishperoxidase (HRP) conjugateAnti - N. sumatrana venom IgG and three anti-toxins IgG wereisolated from rabbit sera (upon completion of immunizationscheme) by Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography, followed byProtein A affinity chromatography [24]. The IgG-HRP conjugatewas prepared as described by Wisdom, 1996 [25].Investigation of immunological cross-reactivity of N.sumatrana major venom toxins (phospholipase A2, PLA2;neurotoxin, NTX; cardiotoxin, CTX)Indirect ELISA for investigation of immunological cross-reactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated with 100 ng/ml ofvenom toxin (phospholipase A2, PLA2; neurotoxin, NTX orcardiotoxin, CTX) respectively and incubated overnight at 4uC.The plates were washed with PBS-Tween and subsequently anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilutions 1:200) wasadded and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. ThisAuthor SummaryNaja sumatrana is a medically important cobra species inSoutheast Asia. The optimization of snakebite manage-ment and the use of antivenom depend greatly on theknowledge of the venom\u2019s composition, its biologicalactivities, as well as its pharmacokinetics. The presentstudy on the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venomshows that the systemic bioavailability of this venom inexperimental envenomation is similar to N. sputatrixvenom determined in an earlier study. The neurotoxinand cardiotoxin exhibited a more rapid absorption andelimination compared to the phospholipase A2 and thewhole venom. The venom neurotoxin produced a highersystemic bioavailability than the cardiotoxin and phos-pholipase A2, suggesting that the neurotoxin plays themajor toxic role in cobra bites.Pharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom ToxinsPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890was followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradishperoxidase conjugate (dilutions of 1:6000) and 100 ml of substrateo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h. Thereaction was terminated by adding 50 ml sulfuric acid (12.5%).The absorbance at 492 nm was then determined using Bio-RadModel 690 microplate reader. The degree of cross-reactivity wasexpressed in percentage (%) of absorbance.Double-sandwich ELISA for investigation of immunologicalcross-reactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated overnight at4uC with 100 ml of anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTX IgG(4 mg/ml), respectively. Plates were then incubated with 100 ml of therespective venom toxins as antigens (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin,cardiotoxin) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. This was followed byincubation with 100 ml of anti-toxins IgG-HRP conjugate (1:400) for2 h, and 100 ml of substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride(0.4 mg/ml) was then added. The reaction was terminated after 1 h byadding 50 ml of 12.5% sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 492 nmwere then determined using Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader.The degree of cross-reactivity was expressed in percentage (%) ofabsorbance.SDS-PAGE and western blotting (immunoblotting). SDS-PAGE was conducted in an electrophoresis (slab) system accordingto the method described by Studier, 1973 [26] and a FermentasSpectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder broad range SDS-PAGE standard was used for calibration. Ten micrograms of venomtoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin or cardiotoxin) was electro-phoresed (15% gel) under reducing condition.The proteins on the polyacrylamide gel was transferred to apolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (iBlot Gel Transferstacks, PVDF, mini, Invitrogen) using iBlot blotting system(Invitrogen). The PVDF membrane was subsequently blocked wit2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20. Anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilution of 1:500 in TBS-Tween) wasadded to the PVDF membrane followed by incubation with Goatanti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (dilutions of1:1000) for 1 h. The chromogenic detection of the protein bands onthe PVDF membrane was carried out by addition of the substratesolution (Novex HRP Chromogenic Substrate (TMB), Invitrogen).Determination of serum venom antigen and venom toxinantigen levels using double-sandwich ELISADouble-sandwich ELISA was conducted as described previously[27]. It was used to monitor the serum venom antigen levelsfollowing experimental envenomation in rabbits (n = 3) duringpharmacokinetic studies. Briefly, ELISA immunoplates werecoated overnight at 4uC with optimal coating concentration forvenom and venom toxins, which has been optimized as statedabove in the previous section (double-sandwich ELISA forinvestigation of immunological cross-reactivity). This was followedby subsequent incubation with 100 ml of diluted rabbit serumsamples (1:20) collected at different time intervals, 100 ml of anti-N.sumatrana venom IgG-HRP conjugate and anti-toxins IgG-HRPconjugate (dilution of 1:400) for 2 h. Substrate o-phenylenedi-amine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) was added for colorimetricdevelopment and the absorbance at 492 nm was then determinedusing Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader. A standard curvewas constructed using varying dilutions of venom or the respectivetoxins in the spiked pre-envenomed sera.Pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins afterintravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrationsThe pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins wasstudied using rabbits (n = 3). A sub-lethal dose of the venom ortoxins was administered intravenously (i.v., marginal ear vein) orintramuscularly (i.m., quadriceps) into rabbits. Doses administeredwere as follow: venom 0.5 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.);phospholipase A2 0.1 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); neurotoxin0.07 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); cardiotoxin 0.15 mg/kg(i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.). Blood samples were collected fromcentral ear artery before experimental envenomation and atspecific time points (5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h and24 h) after venom injection. The collected blood samples werecentrifuged at 3,500 g for 20 min to obtain the sera, which werekept at -20uC until further analysis. The serum antigen concen-trations were measured by double-sandwich ELISA as describedabove using the pre-envenomed serum sample taken from thesame animal as the control for baseline reading.A parallel series of experiments were conducted to investigatethe pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin in the whole venom when N.sumatrana venom was injected intravenously or intramuscularlyinto the rabbits (n = 3). The serum concentrations of cardiotoxin(in the whole venom) at specified sampling times were estimatedusing anti-CTX IgG on a double-sandwich ELISA, as describedabove. The equivalent amounts of cardiotoxin in the injectedwhole venom (0.1 mg/kg, i.v. or 0.5 mg/kg, i.m.) were estimated tobe 0.04 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, based on a 40% (by drymass) composition of the whole venom [10]. This additional studyaimed to verify if the pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin wheninjected alone would be significantly different from that wheninjected in its native environment (the whole venom).Pharmacokinetic analysisThe pharmacokinetic parameters of N. sumatrana venom andvenom toxins were determined using the method of feathering[28]. The initial phase rate constant (a) and terminal phase rateconstant (b) were determined from the slopes of the best-fit linesobtained for the initial phase and terminal phase, respectively, ofthe log plasma concentration versus time plot. The initial phasehalf-life (T1/2a) and terminal phase half-life (T1/2 b) weredetermined by formula T1/2a or T1/2b = 0.693/a or b. The areaunder the curve (AUC) was calculated from zero time to the lastexperimental time point by trapezoidal rule and extrapolated toinfinity (AUC0-\u2018) according to the formula: AUC0-\u2018 = AUC0-t+Ct/b, where t is the last experimental time point and Ct representsthe last serum venom concentration determined at time t.The distribution rate constants for the transfer between centralcompartment (designated as 1) and peripheral compartment(designated as 2) were calculated from the equations: k21 = (Ab+ Ba)/(A+B) and k12 = a+ b 2 k212 (ab/k21).The other important pharmacokinetic parameters were deter-mined as follows:Systemic clearance, CL = dose (F)/AUC0-\u2018Volume of distribution by area, Vd,area = CL/bVolume of central compartment, Vc = Dosei.v./(A + B)Volume of peripheral compartment, Vp = k12/k21 (Vc)Fi.v. is the intravenous bioavailability which is 1.Fi.m. is the intramuscular bioavailability, and was calculated asfollows:Fi:m~AUCi:m:AUCi:v:|Dosei:v:Dosei:m:Statistical analysisAll data are reported as the mean 6 S.D. or mean (95% C.I.).Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences betweenPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom ToxinsPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890two independent groups. Kruskal-Wallis H Test is the nonpara-metric test for the comparison of more than two independentgroups. The level of significance was set at p,0.05. The statisticalanalysis was conducted using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,USA).ResultsPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom followingintravenous administrationThe serum concentration-time profiles of whole N. sumatranavenom antigen following a single i.v. and i.m. administrations ofvenom into rabbits (n = 3) are shown in Figure 1.The i.v. serum concentration-time profile of N. sumatrana venom(0.1 mg/kg) (Figure 1, dotted line) showed a bi-exponential patternwhich was best fitted to a two-compartment model of pharmaco-kinetics described by the equation Ct = Ae2at + Be2bt: where Ctrepresents the concentration at time, t; A and B represent thevenom concentrations at the zero time intercepts of the initial fastphase and terminal slow phase, respectively; while a and brepresent the first-order disposition rate constants for the initialfast phase and the terminal phase, respectively.The venom antigen level declined rapidly within the first 1 h(T1/2a = 0.8 6 0.3 h) during the initial phase followed by a muchslower decline at the terminal phase (T1/2b = 13.661.1 h). Thevolume of distribution by area (Vd,area) of the venom antigens inrabbits was 1.860.03 L, and the systemic clearance (CL) was91.367.8 ml/h, and the AUC0-\u2018 was 2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h.The distribution rate constant for transfer from central toperipheral compartment (k12 = 0.460.2 h21) was comparable tothat from peripheral to central compartment (k21 = 0.560.2 h21;p.0.05). Consequently, the volume of peripheral compartment(0.860.2 L) calculated based on the ratio of k constants wascomparable to that of central compartment (1.060.1 L).Pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom followingintramuscular administrationThe intramuscular administration of whole N. sumatrana venomin rabbits yielded a serum concentration-time profile (Figure 1,solid line) with the absorption and distribution phase appearedindistinguishable. The venom antigen level peaked within 1 h at aconcentration (Cmax) of 391.7648.5 ng/ml. The terminal half-life(T1/2b = 12.560.9 h), volume of distribution by area (Vd,area= 1.760.1 L) and the systemic clearance (CL = 94.8612.7 ml/h) ofthe venom antigen following i.m. injection were not significantlydifferent from that of i.v. pharmacokinetic parameters (p.0.05)(Table 1).The AUC0-\u2018 of N. sumatrana venom when injected intramuscu-larly (0.5 mg/kg) was 4617.86583.8 ng/ml.h. However, whenadjusted to the intravenous venom dose (0.1 mg/kg), thenormalized AUC0-\u2018 of the venom antigens following i.m.administration was 923.66116.8 ng/ml.h, which was significantlylower than the i.v. AUC0-\u2018 value (2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h;p,0.05). The i.m. bioavailability (Fi.m.) calculated from the twoAUC0-\u2018 values were 41.960.2%.Immunological cross-reactions of N. sumatrana venomtoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin)The phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin wereisolated and purified from N. sumatrana venom. The proteinidentity of each toxin was confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF andis shown in Table 2.Indirect ELISA and double-sandwich ELISA demonstratedextensive cross-reactions between phospholipase A2 and neuro-Figure 1.

These findings were supported by Western blot results(Figure 2): the anti-PLA2 IgG only reacted with the phospholipaseA2 and neurotoxin, but not with cardiotoxin; and similarly, theanti-NTX IgG only reacted with the neurotoxin and phospholi-pase A2, but not with cardiotoxin. Anti-CTX IgG reactedonly with cardiotoxin, but neither with phospholipase A2 norneurotoxin. The neurotoxin appears to migrate to a higherposition than it should (i.e. in the same position as phospholipaseA2) (Figure 2). To further examine this phenomenon, weperformed protein mass analysis and confirmed that the neuro-toxin isolated is indeed short neurotoxin with a molecular mass of6.5 kDa (unpublished data). The mass increase of neurotoxin asobserved from SDS-PAGE could be attributed to the oxidation ofTable 1.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of the \u2018\u2018in-venom\u2019\u2019cardiotoxin following the intravenous and intramuscular admin-istrations are shown in Table 5. The pharmacokinetic parametersof cardiotoxin when only the toxin was administered are alsolisted for comparison (see Discussion). Most of the pharmacoki-netic parameters of the in-venom cardiotoxin were comparablewith values obtained when only purified cardiotoxin wasadministered, with the major exceptions of a longer eliminationhalf-life (T1/2b) and a lower clearance (CL) for the in-venomcardiotoxin (Table 5).DiscussionGenerally, the serum concentration-time profile of the venom/toxin injected intravenously can be described by an open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model where the venom or toxin isdistributed between the central and peripheral compartments. Thedistribution half-life of N. sumatrana venom (T1/2a = 0.77 h) iscomparable to the value obtained for N. sputatrix venom in anearlier study (T1/2a = 0.5 h) [22], and to that for the African cobravenoms (T1/2a = 22.2\u201330.5 min) [15] although a three\u2013compart-ment pharmacokinetic model was applied in the latter case. Theterminal half-life (T1/2b = 13.6 h) of N. sumatrana venom was notsignificantly different to that of N. sputatrix venom (T1/2b = 15.4 h)[22], indicating that the elimination of the venom antigens of thesetwo Southeast Asian spitting cobras occurred at similar rate.The volume of central compartment approximated 1 L for N.sumatrana venom, indicating that on intravenous administration,the venom distributes rapidly and uniformly not only in the plasmaof the animal (28\u201350 ml/kg for rabbit) but also in highly perfusedtissues and interstitial fluids as well in view of its major contentbeing water-soluble low molecular mass toxins (,10 kDa) whichmay readily permeate the vascular endothelium [10]. As the ratioof the inter-compartmental transfer rate constants k12 and k21 forthe venom approximates unity (k12/k21 = 0.78), this means that atequilibrium (when inter-compartmental transfer rates are equal),the amount of venom antigens in both the compartments do notvary significantly. This finding corroborates with that obtained inour earlier pharmacokinetic study of N. sputatrix venom (k12/k21 = 1) [22]. On the other hand, the large Vd,area of the venom(1.8 L, more than 10-fold of the total blood volume of a 2-kgrabbit) suggests that this cobra venom antigens distributeextensively to the peripheral or extra-vascular tissues. This seemsto be a general phenomenon for venom antigens distribution inexperimentally envenomed animals [12,13,15]. Venom toxins thatare distributed widely into the peripheral compartment may beassociated with the rebound phenomenon that sometimes occurduring antivenom therapy as rapid immunodepletion of venomtoxins in the blood favors the redistribution of venom antigensfrom the peripheral back into the central compartment [31,32].To study the absorption of venom from the non-vascularparenteral administration site, the pharmacokinetics of N. suma-trana venom was studied following an intramuscular administrationof the venom (sub-lethal dose) into rabbits. The resulting serumvenom antigen concentration-time profile showed a relatively fastabsorption of some venom antigens within the first few minutes. Asubsequent short lag observed during the absorption phase of thevenom was probably due to the absorption of some venomantigens via the lymphatic route from the injection site into bloodcirculation [20]. However, the serum concentration-time profile ofthe intramuscularly injected whole venom yields apparentlyindistinguishable absorption and distribution phases of the varioustoxins. The indistinguishable absorption and distribution phasereflects the continuous absorption of various antigenic venomcomponents that occur simultaneously with their respectivedistribution phases. There was only one major serum concentra-tion peak seen at 1 h, presumably caused by the summatedabsorption of a bulk of phospholipase A2 (Tmax,2 h) and thethree-finger toxins, i.e. neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (Tmax,K h)into the systemic circulation occurring at a rate in close proximitywith each other. Rapid absorption of the venom with a short Tmaxcorrelates with the fast onset of neurotoxic effect in cobraenvenoming, where the venom is known to exert direct inhibitoryaction on the neuromuscular junction via a postsynaptic blockade[33]. Administration of the venom by intramuscular route did notalter T1/2b, Vd,area and CL of the venom antigens. This indicatesthat the elimination (and not the absorption) process is likely therate-limiting step for the terminal phase of the pharmacokineticprofile of intramuscularly injected venom.As demonstrated from ion-exchange HPLC studies [10], N.sumatrana venom contains more neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (17%and 40%, respectively) compared to N. sputatrix venom (consists of8% neurotoxin and 35% cardiotoxin). However, N. sputatrix venomhas substantially greater amount (35%) of phospholipase A2 thanN. sumatrana venom (28%). This may account for the somewhatgreater plasma clearance of N. sumatrana venom (91.3 ml/h)compared to that of N. sputatrix venom (68.7 ml/h), since thesmaller three-finger toxins (more abundant in N. sumatrana venom)are cleared faster than the larger phospholipase A2 (moreabundant in N. sputatrix venom), especially via the renal excretionroute.The bioavailability of N. sumatrana venom following i.m. injectionwas 41.9%, indicating incomplete absorption of the antigenicvenom components from the injection site into the systemiccirculation. This may be due to strong affinities of the cobravenom toxins at the injection site [12,21], and this hypothesiscorrelates well with cobra venom\u2019s prominent toxic effect on localtissues that lasts for days to weeks [9,34\u201336]. The bioavailability ofN. sumatrana venom (Fi.m.) was similar to that of N. sputatrix venom(Fi.m = 41.7%), which is a reflection of the fact that the cardiotoxinrepresents the bulk of both venoms (Fi.m. of cardiotoxin was 46%,discussed below).Pharmacokinetics of the individual major toxins of N.sumatrana venomSince snake venom is a mixture of hundreds of proteins andpeptides, it is therefore virtually impossible to investigate thepharmacokinetics of each individual toxin when the whole venomwas administered into rabbits. As such, in this study, we onlyselected three representative toxins of N. sumatrana venom(neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2) for pharmacoki-netic investigations. These three toxins also represent the majortypes of toxins in the venom.It should be noted that accurate quantitative measurement ofindividual toxins in the serum of experimentally envenomedanimal using ELISA assay is not always feasible because of theimmunological cross-reactivities observed among the snake venomtoxins [37]. Indeed, our immunological cross-reaction studiesrevealed extensive cross-reactivity between the phospholipase A2and polypeptide neurotoxin purified from N. sumatrana venom,demonstrating that unrelated venom proteins of distinctiveprimary structures and biological functions may share commonantigenic domains [27,38]. As such, in the present report thepharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom purified phospholipaseA2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin was studied after intravenous orintramuscular injection of a sub-lethal dose of each toxin intorabbits. Double-sandwich ELISA was developed in which specificPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom ToxinsPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890anti-toxin IgG\u2019s (i.e. anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTXIgG) were used to measure the serum toxin antigen levels followinginjections of the individual toxins into rabbits.The individual serum concentration-time profiles of the toxins,as with the whole venom, injected intravenously were also bestfitted to an open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, wherethe toxins distributed between central and peripheral compart-ments. Following intravenous administration, the individual toxinsi.e. phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin demonstratedshorter distribution half-lives (0.56\u20130.66 h) compared to the wholevenom (0.93 h), reflecting a more rapid distribution of the purifiedtoxins on entering the systemic circulation.On the other hand, unlike that observed for the whole venom,there was no fluctuation pattern during the absorption and/ordistribution phase in the serum concentration-time profile ofindividual toxins administered intramuscularly. The significantdifferences in the absorption of the whole venom and toxins werealso reflected by the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax). Theneurotoxin and cardiotoxin antigens reached their respective peakconcentrations much faster than phospholipase A2, indicating fastabsorption of these two low molecular mass toxin molecules(approx. 8 kDa) from the injection site into the systemiccirculation. These principal cobra toxins are known to directlytarget receptors and cellular membranes, inducing rather rapidtissue responses compared to some viperid toxins the actions ofwhich involve intermediate steps to accomplish the toxic effect, forinstance, coagulopathy secondary to defribrinogenation inducedby thrombin-like enzymes [32]. The fast absorption of neurotoxinand cardiotoxin likely accounts for the rapid onset of the systemiceffects upon cobra envenomation i.e. neuromuscular paralysis andcardiac complications [7,9,39]. In view of the rapid absorption ofthese major toxins, meticulous monitoring for early institution ofantivenom when indicated becomes crucial in order to alleviatethe severity of syndrome and to preempt fatal outcome.Furthermore, all the three toxins exhibited a large Vd,area (1.6\u20132.2 L) which are .10 fold of the total blood volume of a rabbit,suggesting that the toxin antigens distributed extensively into theperipheral tissues. This finding is congruent with the large volumeof distribution of the whole venom in rabbits as described above.Both the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (2.0\u20132.2 L) showed a largerVd,area compared to the phospholipase A2 (1.4 L), and this may bebecause low molecular mass proteins like neurotoxin andcardiotoxin (with molecular mass of approximately 7\u20138 kDa) crossthe capillary endothelium more easily than do the larger proteins[13] such as phospholipase A2 (16 kDa).In this study, the terminal half-lives (T1/2b) of neurotoxin andcardiotoxin were similar (8.6\u20138.8 h) but shorter than that ofphospholipases A2 (11.7 h). This finding is consistently reflected inthe systemic clearance of the three toxins, where the clearancevalues of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin were significantly larger(indicative of faster elimination) than that of phospholipase A2.Assuming that the elimination takes place primarily from thecentral compartment and probably via the renal excretion route,the faster clearance of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin can beexplained by the higher vascular permeability of the two toxinsas both are low molecular mass peptides. However, the T1/2bvalues for the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin determined in this studyare substantially different from the terminal half-lives of Africancobras\u2019 a-neurotoxin (15\u201329 h, in rabbits) [15] and that ofcytotoxin from Chinese cobra, Naja naja atra (3.5 h, in rabbits)[12], suggesting intrageneric variations in the pharmacokinetics ofthese cobra three-finger toxins.Among the three major toxins, N. sumatrana neurotoxin has themost complete systemic absorption from the injection site, asevidenced by its higher intramuscular bioavailability(Fi.m. = 81.5%) than that of phospholipase A2 (68.6%) andcardiotoxin (45.6%). This is in agreement with the finding ofIsmail et al. (1998) [16], who reported a bioavailability of 88% forWalterinnesia aegyptia a-neurotoxin. Interestingly, the Fi.m. ofcardiotoxin was only 45.6%, presumably due to the strongbinding affinity of cardiotoxin to the tissues at the injection siteresulting in a poor absorption of cardiotoxin into the systemiccirculation. On the other hand, the Fi.m. of the phospholipase A2was 68.6%, indicating that a substantial amount of the toxinremained at the injection site. Indeed, bites from N. sumatrana (andmost Naja cobras) can produce local envenomation characterizedby local tissue necrosis involving the cutaneous, muscular andconnective tissue layers [2,9,34,40,41]. Cardiotoxin and phospho-lipase A2 have been reported to interact synergistically and possesspotent cytolytic activity [42,43], and their substantial unabsorbedamount at the injection site seem to suggest that their toxic effectsplay an important role in local envenoming, which consequencesinclude tissue necrosis following cobra bites, as well as venomophthalmia in venom-spitted victims [44].Although the i.v. pharmacokinetic behavior of neurotoxin issimilar to that of cardiotoxin (particularly in having a rapidabsorption with a short Tmax), their intramuscular bioavailabilitiesdiffered markedly. The relatively low bioavailability of cardiotoxinwould suggest that the systemic effects of cardiotoxin may not bethat prominent in cobra envenomation, even though the venomcontains relatively large amount of cardiotoxins (40% of venomcontent [10]). Furthermore, the neurotoxin is known to be muchmore lethal than both the cardiotoxin and phospholipases A2, withan approximate 10-fold lower LD50 in mice (0.1 mg/g, [34]). Itbelongs to a-neurotoxins with high intrinsic activity of inhibitingthe motor endplate nicotinic receptors vis-a\u0300-vis that of cardiotoxinsand phospolipases A2, the target receptors of which are primarilydifferent and their actions are not crucial in mediating neuromus-cular paralysis - the central cobra envenoming feature that leads torapid death [34]. This is consistent with clinical reports whererapid onset of neuromuscular paralysis (caused by neurotoxins) isthe most common fatal manifestation of systemic cobra enven-omation, where victims may succumb to respiratory failure anddeath ensues within minutes to hours [9,36,45]. The pharmaco-kinetic result in addition to the neuromuscular blockade activity ofneurotoxin generally supports the hypothesis that the neurotoxinplays the principal role in systemic envenomation of N. sumatrana,and should be one of the most crucial toxins to be targeted byantivenom. Nevertheless, variations of neurotoxins across cobraspecies have been reported on their structures and activities, andthe phenomenon is likely the clue to varied efficacies ofcommercially available antivenoms in the cross-neutralization ofcobra venoms in the region [46]. The pharmacokinetic profilingmethod hence appears useful in validating the toxin\u2019s role from thepharmacokinetic aspect, and may be further utilized as a tool inassessing antivenom efficacy on the targeted toxin derived fromdifferent cobras.Pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin following intravenous orintramuscular administrations of whole N. sumatranavenomIn view of the negligible immunological cross-reactivity betweencardiotoxin with phospholipase A2 and neurotoxin, it is possible toaccurately determine the serum concentration of cardiotoxinfollowing intravenous or intramuscular administration of thewhole N. sumatrana venom using the same double-sandwich ELISAdeveloped. This study would help to shed light on whether thepharmacokinetics of an individual toxin could be altered by otherPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom ToxinsPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 10 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890venom constituents, and whether the information gathered fromthe pharmacokinetic study of individual toxins can be applied insituations where the whole venom was injected.The serum concentration-time profile of cardiotoxin when wholevenom was injected was found to be similar to that when onlypurified cardiotoxin was injected (Figure 3C and 3D). It is howevernoted that when whole venom was injected, cardiotoxin exhibited alonger T1/2b and a lower CL than when only cardiotoxin wasinjected. The results therefore suggest that the rate of elimination ofcardiotoxin in the whole venom is likely affected by the presence ofother venom components in the venom due to competition amongvarious venom components for the elimination processes. Theresults reflect that in N. sumatrana envenomation, pharmacokineticcharacteristics of individual major toxins can be largely applied tosituations where the whole venom is injected, with the possibleexception that the rate of elimination of the toxins determined maybe higher than that of the whole venom. On the other hand, theintramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m) of cardiotoxin injected withwhole venom (39.5%) was similarly low, if not even lower,compared to the Fi.m. of cardiotoxin when only the toxin wasadministered (45.6%), consistent with the indication that cardio-toxin remained substantially unabsorbed at the injection tissue site.ConclusionsIn general, the elimination half-life of the whole venom isdetermined by the toxic components with the longest T1/2b(phospholipase A2 in the case of N. sumatrana venom), while itsintramuscular bioavailability is influenced more by the toxiccomponents that is present most abundantly in the venom(cardiotoxin, in this case). In the present pharmacokinetic studyof N. sumatrana venom and toxins, both the neurotoxin andcardiotoxin were rapidly absorbed intramuscularly in the rabbits,with neurotoxin achieving the highest systemic bioavailability,while the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 possess relativelylower bioavailabilities. These pharmacokinetic findings thereforesuggest that the neurotoxin is the principal toxin in systemicenvenomation (fatal neuromuscular paralysis), while significantamounts of the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 remain bound tothe injection site, causing local tissue destruction. Using toxin-specific ELISA, the study also shows that the cobra venompharmacokinetics is likely an approximation of the pharmacoki-netics of individual toxins except for parameters relating toelimination rate due to possible competition of various toxins forthe process in vivo.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: NHT SMS SYF.
