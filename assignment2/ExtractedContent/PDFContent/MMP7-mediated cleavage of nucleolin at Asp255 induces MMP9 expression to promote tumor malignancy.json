"MMP7-mediated cleavage of nucleolin at Asp255 induces MMP9 expression to promote tumor malignancyORIGINAL ARTICLEMMP7-mediated cleavage of nucleolin at Asp255 inducesMMP9 expression to promote tumor malignancyT-I Hsu1,2, S-C Lin1, P-S Lu1, W-C Chang1,2,3,4,5, C-Y Hung3, Y-M Yeh6, W-C Su6, P-C Liao7 and J-J Hung1,2,3,4,5Nucleolin (NCL) participates in DNA transcription, ribosomal biogenesis and the regulation of RNA stability. However, thecontribution of NCL to tumor development is still not clear. Herein, we found that NCL expression correlated with poor prognosis inlung cancer patients. Overexpressed NCL was predominantly cleaved to C-terminal truncated NCL (TNCL). In lung cancer formation,activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway induced NCL expression, and also the expression of matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) 7, which then cleaved NCL at Asp255 to generate TNCL of 55 kDa. TNCL increased the expression ofseveral oncogenes, including MMP9, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), HIF1a and CBLB, and decreased the expression of tumorsuppressors including BRD4, PCM1, TFG and KLF6 by modulating mRNA stability through binding to the 3\u2019-untranslated regions oftheir transcripts, thus ultimately enhancing metastasis activity. In conclusion, this study identified a novel role of the cleavage formof NCL generated by MMP7 in stabilizing MMP9 mRNA. We also provide a new insight that MMP7 not only cleaves the extracellularmatrix to promote tumor invasion but also cleaves NCL, which augment oncogenesis. Blocking NCL cleavage may provide a usefulnew strategy for lung cancer therapy.Oncogene (2015) 34, 826\u2013837; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.22; published online 17 March 2014INTRODUCTIONNucleolin (NCL) is a well-known RNA-binding protein thatparticipates in DNA transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, mRNAtranslation and mRNA stability. The N-terminal domain of NCLregulates transcription and the maturation of ribosomal RNA;1 thecentral region containing 4 RNA-binding domains associates withmRNA or pre-ribosomal RNA to regulate their stability;2,3 theC-terminus interacts with ribosomal proteins to regulate RNAtranslation.4,5 In addition, the NCL level is increased in highlyproliferating cells, but the mechanism controlling NCL abundanceis still not clear.Protein cleavage affects the properties of cancer cells. Cleavageform of laminin-332 by matriptase enhances the motility ofprostate cancer cells.6 Cleavage form of \u03b21 integrin mediated bymatrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 promotes colon cancer cellmotility.7 In lymphoma, nuclear factor-\u03baB-inducing kinase cleavesthe API2\u2013MALT1 fusion oncoprotein to activate the noncanonicalnuclear factor-\u03baB pathway, which promotes apoptosis resistance.8Cleavage of NCL by granzyme A was first demonstrated andsuggested that this phenomenon is important for apoptosis.9Furthermore, in apoptotic cells, an increase in cleaved NCL(80 kDa) is accompanied by a decrease in full-length NCL(110 kDa).10,11 Moreover, self-cleaving activity-mediated produc-tion of 100-, 70-, 60- and 50-kDa forms of NCL was identified inproliferating cells.12 However, the cleavage site of NCL and thefunctions of cleaved NCL have not been studied.MMP7 (matrilysin), the smallest MMP that lacks a C-terminalhemopexin domain, is overexpressed in various types of cancer,including gastric, pancreatic and colon cancer.13\u201315 In addition tocleave the extracellular matrix (ECM), MMP7 also cleaves otherproteins to affect the properties of cancer. MMP7-mediatedcleavage of Fas ligand protects tumor cells from chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity.16 Cleavage of C-type lectin domain family-3member A and E-cadherin by MMP7 enhances tumor invasion byinducing cell dissociation from ECM.17,18 These results describedabove indicate that MMP7 cleaves membrane proteins andsecretory proteins. However, it is still unknown that whetherMMP7 has intracellular proteolytic activity.In this study, we show that the protease activity of MMP7enhances tumorigenesis through the cleavage of NCL. IncreasedNCL expression significantly correlated with poor prognosis inlung cancer patients. In human and mouse lung cancer, NCL wasmainly expressed as a 55-kDa protein, generated by MMP7cleavage at Asp255. Cleaved NCL aggressively promoted pro-liferation and metastasis. Furthermore, cleaved NCL increased theexpression of cancer-related genes, such as MMP9 and ALK, byassociating with mRNA 30-untranslated regions (UTRs) to enhancemRNA stability. These findings highlight the importance of MMP7-mediated NCL cleavage in lung cancer development.RESULTSAccumulation of NCL, processed to a C-terminal truncated form,correlates with poor prognosis in lung cancer patientsPast studies of NCL mainly focused on its regulation of ribosomalbiogenesis and mRNA stability.19 The functional role of NCL intumor growth and metastasis remains poorly understood,especially in lung cancer. To address this issue, we first studied1Institute of Bioinformatics and Biosignal Transduction, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 2Center for Infection Diseaseand Signal Transduction, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 3Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 4Department ofPharmacology, College of Medicine, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 5Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University,Taipei, Taiwan; 6Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and Hospital, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan and 7Department of Environmental andOccupational Health, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

Of the 97 tumorspecimens from patients, 62, 20 and 15 showed strong, moderateand negative NCL expression, respectively. In addition, of 65normal lung tissues, 31 and 34 showed moderate and negativeexpression, respectively, but none showed high NCL expression(Figure 1A(b)). When the relationship between the NCL level andsurvival rate was compared, we found that higher NCL expressioncorrelated with poor prognosis for lung cancer progression(Figure 1A and Table 1). Furthermore, NCL level was examinedin seven other clinical lung cancer samples by immunoblotanalysis (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1A). Interestingly,not only was NCL markedly upregulated, it was also processedinto a 55-kDa truncated protein. To further address this finding,two transgenic mouse models including K-rasG12D- and EGFRL858R-induced lung cancers were established, and used to study the NCLexpression and post-translational processing. In these mice, NCLwas upregulated and was majorly present as a 55-kDa truncatedprotein (Figures 1C and D, and Supplementary Figure S1C).Furthermore, the signal of 55-kDa protein was attenuated by NCLFigure 1.

Treatmentof A431 and H1299 cells with EGF significantly increased thetranscriptional activity, mRNA and protein levels of NCL in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2a and c and Supplementary FiguresS2A and B). In contrast, an EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib and a K-rasinhibitor, FTI-276, significantly decreased the transcriptional activity,the mRNA and protein expression of NCL (SupplementaryFigures S2C and H). Interestingly, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 by U0126 also prevented EGF-mediatedNCL upregulation, suggesting that NCL was induced via the EGFRpathway through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and2 activation (Figure 2d). The NCL promoter contains specificityprotein-1 (Sp1) binding elements, and our previous studiesindicated that mitogenic signals, including EGFR and K-rasactivation, contributes to Sp1 accumulation.20,21 Therefore, wespeculated that Sp1 contributesto NCL upregulation in lung cancerformation. The expression of NCL significantly increased withincreasing doses of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sp1, and Sp1knockdown decreased NCL expression (Figure 2e andSupplementary Figures S3A and C). Furthermore, EGF-inducedupregulations of NCL promoter activity and protein were abolishedby Sp1 knockdown (Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure S3D). TheSp1 binding sites predicted by TFSEARCH website were mutatedindividually to identify the region required for EGF-mediated NCLinduction (Figure 2g). Loss of Sp1 binding sites localized at the \u2013200region of the NCL promoter abolished the NCL upregulation by EGFtreatment. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay wasperformed to study the recruitment of Sp1 to the promoter of NCL(Figure 2h). The results showed that Sp1 was recruited to the NCLpromoter (\u2013273/\u201384). Therefore, we propose a model in which EGFinduces NCL expression through the activation of the extracellularsignal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 pathway and subsequentSp1-mediated transcription (Figure 2i).MMP7 cleaves NCL at Asp255 during lung cancer formationWe next investigated the processing of full-length NCL into a55-kDa truncated protein. The level of cleaved NCL was clearlyhigher in lung cancer cell lines, H1299 and A549, than that innormal lung epithelial cells, Beas-2B (Figure 3a). To determinewhether NCL was cleaved at the C-terminus or N-terminus,GFP-NCL-myc was overexpressed in cells. The anti-myc antibodyrecognized the truncated form at 55 kDa, but the GFP antibodydid not, indicating that full-length NCL was cleaved at theN-terminus (Supplementary Figures S4A and C). To confirm thisresult, an antibody that recognizes N-terminus of NCL wasproduced to study NCL was generated. Full-length NCL wasdetected in cell lines, but little signal was found in clinical lungcancer samples, indicating that nearly all of the NCL was cleavedin vivo (Supplementary Figure S1E). In addition, the antibodythat recognizes N-terminal NCL did not recognize the 55-kDa formof NCL, indicating that the C-terminus of NCL was present in lungcancer cells (Supplementary Figures S1D and E). To identify thecutting site(s), several plasmids expressing N-terminally truncatedforms of NCL were constructed (Supplementary Figure S4A).Data indicated that the cutting N-terminal part from GFP-TNCL(251\u2013710 aa) was nearly the same as GFP-only, implying thatthe cutting site may locate between aa 251 and aa 260(Supplementary Figure S4B). Several GFP-NCL-myc constructs withthe individual mutation between aa 249 and aa 260 wereprepared to probe the exact cutting site. As shown in Figure 3b,the mutation of Asp255 to Ala (Asp255Ala) blocked the cleavage,suggesting that Asp255 is the major site for NCL cleavage.Subsequently, we investigated the proteinase(s) that cleavedNCL. We evaluated the effect of the aspartate protease family onNCL cleavage. Treatment with the aspartate protease inhibitorpepstatin or knockdown of the aspartate protease, TASP1 andADAMTS1, did not alter NCL cleavage (Supplementary Figures S5Aand C). However, marimastat, an MMP inhibitor, attenuated NCLcleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3c), suggesting thatthe MMP family has a functional role in NCL cleavage. Knockdownof MMP2, 9, or 13 did not affect cleavage of NCL (SupplementaryFigures S5D and E). In contrast, MMP7 knockdown mark-edly decreased endogenously cleaved NCL and increased full-length NCL (Figure 3d). Furthermore, MMP7 overexpressionincreased NCL cleavage (Figure 3e). To further confirm the effectof MMP7 on NCL cleavage, MMP7 was knocked down in cellsexpressing GFP-NCL-myc. As shown in Figure 3f, cleaved NCL-mycdisappeared with MMP7 knockdown, suggesting that MMP7 isrequired for NCL cleavage. On the other hand, MMP7 over-expression increased the level of cleaved NCL-myc (Figure 3g).Moreover, MMP7 efficiently enhanced the production of cleavedNCL-myc in cells expressing GFP-NCL-myc, but not in cellsexpressing GFP-NCLD255A-myc (Figure 3g). To confirm that MMP7cleaved NCL directly, we synthesized a peptide corresponding toaa 252-aa 262 of NCL (DDEDDDDEDDE), incubated the peptidewith MMP7 recombinant protein and assessed cleavage bymass spectrometry analysis. The amount of uncleaved peptide(1339-Da) decreased, and the amount of cleaved peptide (861-Da)increased with increasing concentration of the MMP7 protein(Figure 3h). The cleaved 861-Da peptide was identified as aa255-aa 262 (DDDDEDDE). In the absence of NCL peptide, we didnot detect a signal in the presence of MMP7 (SupplementaryFigure S4D), indicating that the results of mass spectrometryanalysis reflect the cleaved NCL peptide. After confirming thespecificity of the anti-MMP7 antibody by knocking downendogenous MMP7, which abolished the signal of MMP7(Supplementary Figures S6A and S6B), we investigated thedistributions of NCL and MMP7 in lung cancer cells in vivo andin vitro. NCL and MMP7 expression levels were localized in nucleusof lung tumor cells in human lung tumors and K-rasG12D lungcancer mice (Figures 4a and b), Moreover, NCL majorly interactedwith MMP7 in nucleus, and slight interaction signal was found incytoplasm (Figure 4c; Supplementary Figures S6D and S6E). Inaddition, most of overexpressed GFP-NCL stayed in nucleolus andcolocalized with MMP7, implying that the cleavage of NCL byMMP7 majorly occurred inside nucleolus (Supplementary FigureS6C). As previous studies indicate that MMP7 is major stayedoutside the cell, not in the nucleus including nucleolus, distributionof MMP7 in cells was studied. Data indicated the MMP7 not onlyTable 1.

To exclude the possibility that MMP-related proteasesin specimens of mice cause NCL cleavage during the experimentalprocedure, we prepared the lysis buffer containing different dosesof marimastat. In Supplementary Figure S6F, we found thatmarimastat did not affect NCL cleavage. On the basis of theprevious studies demonstrating that NCL distributes on plasmamembrane, we also detected NCL on plasma membrane withoutpermeabilizing cell membrane (Supplementary Figure S7A). More-over, we found that both of NCL and MMP7 distributed in thefraction of plasma membrane (Supplementary Figure S7B),suggesting that MMP7 may cleave membrane NCL. We also usedtwo antibodies targeting different epitopes of NCL to detect NCLcleavage in cell lines and human specimens. In SupplementaryFigure 2.

On the basis of our findings, MMP7associates with NCL and cleaved NCL to generate TNCLcomprising C-terminal aa 255\u2013aa 710. This process occurs majorlyin nucleus, but may also slightly occur in cytoplasm.TNCL increases lung tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in vitroand in vivo by increasing MMP9 protein levelsWe next studied the function of TNCL in lung tumorigenesis.Knockdown of NCL in A549 and H1299 cells inhibited cellproliferation (Figure 5A(a,b)), and increased cleaved poly ADPribose polymerase (PARP) and active caspase 3 signals (Figure 5A(c)), implying that NCL is involved in cell proliferation andapoptosis. As shown in Figures 5B and C, compared with GFP-expressing cells, NCL-expressing cells enhanced cell proliferationand tumor growth in a xenograft model. In these experiments, theoncogenic effect of TNCL was significantly higher than that of NCLin vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TNCL was more effective inenhancing the cellular migration, invasion and lung metastasis ofcells delivered by tail vein injection (Figures 5D and F). Inconclusion, NCL, cleaved by MMP7 during tumorigenesis, is animportant process for the cancer cell progression. Cleaved NCL isincreased in lung tumors and involved in tumor malignancy.Figure 3.

Asshown in Figure 6A, TNCL increased the level and enzymaticactivity of MMP9 in a dose-dependent manner. A major functionof NCL is to maintain mRNA stability. Thus, we analyzed the effectof TNCL on MMP9 mRNA stability by quantitative-PCR (Figure 6B).Actinomycin D treatment markedly decreased MMP9 mRNAwithin 12 h. TNCL delayed MMP9 mRNA degradation to a greaterextent than NCL. Moreover, the luciferase activity of an SV-40promoter containing the 30-UTR of MMP9 mRNA was significantlyincreased by TNCL, but not by NCL (Supplementary Figure S9B).Furthermore, TNCL associated with the MMP9 30-UTR (Figure 6Cand Supplementary Figure S9A). These results indicate that TNCLincreases MMP9 expression by associating with the MMP9 30-UTRto enhance its mRNA stability.MMP7 knockdown reduced the MMP9 protein level (Figure 3d),implying that MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL is important forMMP9 upregulation. To address this issue, MMP7 was knockeddown in GFP- or GFP-TNCL-expressing cells (Figure 6D). GFP-TNCLexpression prevented MMP9 downregulation induced by MMP7knockdown, suggesting that MMP7 increases MMP9 throughNCL cleavage. In addition, with the increase in cleaved NCL in lungtumor development, MMP7 was markedly upregulated, suggest-ing that MMP7 mediates NCL cleavage in lung tumors (Figure 6E).To further study the role of the MMP7-TNCL-MMP9 axis in lungFigure 4.

With the formation ofK-rasG12D-driven lung tumors, NCL, MMP7 and MMP9 wereincreased (Figure 6F(a)). The 32 samples from lung cancer patientswere analyzed for studying the correlation among NCL, MMP7 andMMP9 levels. Of 17 patients with high NCL expression, only 1patient exhibited low levels of MMP7 and MMP9. Of 15 patientswith negative NCL expression, 11 patients exhibited low MMP7and MMP9 levels, implying a high correlation among NCL, MMP7and MMP9 levels (Figure 6F(b) and Table 2). These results suggestthat MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL at Asp255 results inMMP9 mRNA stabilization, leading to lung cancer progression(Figure 6G).Several cancer-related genes are regulated by TNCLWe further investigated the effects of TNCL on other oncogenesand tumor suppressor genes in lung tumors. In complementaryDNA microarray analysis, 285 and 251 genes were significantlyupregulated and downregulated, respectively, by TNCL, comparedwith NCL (Supplementary Figure S10). Gene set enrichmentanalysis revealed that several oncogenes were upregulated,including ALK, CD74, CRTC1, MMP9, HIPK3 and YWHAZ, andfour tumor-suppressor genes, namely BRD4, PCM1, TFG and KLF6,were reduced (Figure 7A and Supplementary Table S1). Weconfirmed these results with quantitative-PCR (Figure 7B). As theN-terminus of NCL is important for ribosomal biogenesis, weanalyzed the effect of TNCL on expression of ribosome-relatedproteins (Supplementary Figure S11). In contrast to NCL, TNCLFigure 6.

The downregulation of these two proteinswas previously shown to be advantageous for tumordevelopment.22,23 To investigate how TNCL increases genesexpression, we found that TNCL associated with oncogenicmRNAs and stabilized the mRNA levels under treatmentwith actinomycin D (Figures 7B and C). Furthermore, TNCL-expressing cells prevented MMP7 knockdown-induced decreasein the mRNA levels of ALK, CRTC1 and HIPK3 (Figure 7D),suggesting that the upregulation of gene expression observed inthe microarray analysis is caused by MMP7-mediated NCLcleavage. ALK or CRTC1 knockdown prevented TNCL-enhancedproliferation (Figure 7E), and MMP9 or ALK knockdownprevented TNCL-enhanced invasion (Figure 7F). Our findingssuggest that MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL is indispensablefor tumor development. By inducing the expression of manycancer-related genes, TNCL has a strong oncogenic effect onlung cancer.On the basis of these findings, we clarify that NCL is a newsubstrate of MMP7 in addition to ECM (Figure 8). NCL, upregulatedin lung cancer by EGFR activation-induced Sp1-mediated tran-scription, is cleaved by MMP7 at Asp255, generating cleaved NCL(aa 255\u2013710). The cleaved NCL promotes tumor malignancythrough enhancing the stability of several oncogenic mRNA andattenuates that of tumor-suppressive mRNA.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that EGFR pathway activation induced NCLexpression. We also found that NCL was cleaved endogenously.Furthermore, specific cleavage of NCL at Asp255 by MMP7 wasidentified, and the cleaved form promoted lung cancer progres-sion by increasing in the expression of oncogenes, such as MMP9and ALK, and decreasing the expression of tumor-suppressorgenes such as KLF6.How NCL is induced during tumorigenesis is still unknown.Herein, we found that EGFR pathway activation was importantfor NCL accumulation during lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore,our previous studies indicated that Sp1 could be induced byEGF treatment in mouse lung primary cells,20 and promoteranalysis identified several GC-rich elements on NCL promoter thatmay function in Sp1 recruitment. Experiments performed in thisstudy showed that NCL expression was induced by Sp1 throughEGFR pathway activation in lung cancer cells. Assessing NCL levelsin human specimens and animal samples by immunoblotting, wefound that a truncated form of NCL, rather than a full-length NCLwas majorly expressed. In addition, when we examined lungcancer cell lines with different metastasis activities, we foundgreater amounts of TNCL in the more malignant cell line, implyingthat TNCL may be related to tumor malignancy. In previousstudies of NCL cleavage, various TNCL proteins of different sizeswere found.9,11,12,24 In lung cancer cell lines, two TNCL proteins of72- and 55 kDa were found. When GFP-NCL-myc was over-expressed in H1299 cell, anti-myc antibody recognized the twoTNCLs, indicating that they contain the C-terminus of TNCLs. Inaddition, when we knocked down MMP7, these two truncatedTNCLs disappeared, implying that MMP7 is necessary for theirformation. However, mutation of Asp255 not only blockedcleavage at Asp255 (generating the 55-kDa form), but alsorepressed the other cleavage, implying that Asp255 is essentialfor the cleavage, that generates the 72-kDa form.MMP7, the smallest one of MMPs, degrades type IV collagenand laminin for tumor invasion.25,26 In this study, we foundthat MMP7 increased MMP9 mRNA stability through NCL cleavagein lung cancer. The effect of MMP7 on MMP9 expressionwas abolished by mutation of Asp255 in NCL, which preventedthe cleavage of NCL, indicating that MMP7-mediated cleavage ofNCL is important for MMP9 expression in lung cancer. In additionto the ECM, MMP7 also cleaves several membrane proteins,including Fas ligand, \u03b24-integrin, E- and N-cadherins.18,27\u201329 Thesestudies suggest that the specificity of MMP7 is not limited to theECM, and that MMP7-mediated cleavage occurs inside the cell.Moreover, NCL expression positively correlated with MMP7expression in human and mouse lung cancer, implying thatoverexpressed NCL is cleaved by MMP7 during tumor develop-ment. In human and mouse specimens, the distribution ofMMP7 is similar with NCL in the cellular nucleus (Figures 4aand b). In H1299 cells, we found that MMP7 colocalized andinteracted with NCL majorly in the nucleus, including nucleo-plasm and nucleolus, slightly in cytosol (Figure 4c andSupplementary Figure S6E). These results indicate that MMP7meets NCL both in cytoplasm and nuclear compartments forcleavage. In studying whether MMP7 cleaves NCL on the plasmamembrane,30 data shown in Supplementary Figure S7 revealedthat both of NCL and MMP7 distributed in the fraction of plasmamembrane, implying that MMP7 may cleave membrane NCL.But this issue still needs further study in the future. In Figure 4c,the membrane NCL is not clearly stained because the cellmembrane was permeabilized by methanol for stainingnucleolar NCL. However, in Supplementary Figure S7A,membrane NCL was stained without permeabilization and clearlyphotographed by confocal immunofluorescent microscope. Inaddition, the inhibitory effect of marimastat on NCL cleavage wasmore pronounced than that of MMP7 knockdown, suggesting thatother MMP members also participate in NCL cleavage. However, inthis study, most NCL was cleaved to a 55-kDa truncated form infreshly prepared tissue extracts, but NCL was only partially cleavedin the cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1C). This is possiblycaused by higher MMP7 expression and activity in an individualthan in cell lines. In preparing cell lysate and tissue lysate with thesame homogenized process, we found that cleaved NCL in celllines was not obvious compared with that in tissue lysate(Supplementary Figure S1C). In addition, marimastat in lysisbuffer did not affect NCL cleavage in tissue lysates(Supplementary Figure S6F), suggesting that abundant NCLcleavage in human and mouse lung cancer reported here wasnot caused by the experimental procedure. We also detected NCLin cell lines and human specimens by using two antibodiesrecognizing different NCL epitopes. Supplementary Figure S8revealed that two antibodies exhibited the same results ofdetecting NCL, suggesting that weak expression of full-lengthNCL in human specimens is not caused by the antibody. InSupplementary Figure S8A, different cancer cell lines exhibiteddifferent extent of NCL cleavage. This may be caused by differentlevels of MMPs. Taken together, our results indicate that MMP7has a pivotal role in cancer metastasis. Previously, MMP7 wasreported to activate MMP9 by cleavage in vitro.31 Here, we foundanother mechanism for the activation of MMP9 by MMP7.MMP7 cleaved NCL, which in turn bound to the 30-UTR ofTable 2.

TNCL also modulated the expression of manyother cancer-related genes to promote lung cancer formation.Compared with full-length NCL, TNCL had stronger proliferation-and metastasis-inducing effects, through the upregulation ofseveral cancer-related genes (Figure 7 and SupplementaryTable S1). In particular, TNCL associated with 30-UTRs to delaythe turnover of MMP9, ALK, CD74 and CRTC1 mRNAs (Figures 6Band 7C). Compared with the frequency of EGFR and KRASmutations, ALK activation, resulting from gene rearrangement,occurs in a smaller proportion of lung cancer patients.33 Theactivation of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase, activates Stat3,phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 signalings for cell proliferation andsurvival.34\u201336 Expression of CD74, a membrane receptor formacrophage migration inhibitory factor, in lung cancer correlateswith angiogenesis, and it cooperates with migration inhibitoryfactor to promote tumor vascularity.37,38 Moreover, nuclearlocalization of CRTC1 promotes lung cancer progression.39,40Other cancer-promoting genes, including HIPK3, CAMK andYWHAZ, are also significantly upregulated by TNCL.41\u201343 On thebasis of the evidence presented above, through enhancing themRNA stability of several oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes,TNCL is sufficient to promote tumor malignancy. Previous studieshave indicated that the N-terminus of NCL participates inribosomal RNA transcription by interacting with some pre-ribosomal RNA processing complexes.1 Overexpression of TNCL,which lacks of N-terminus, downregulates some ribosomalproteins, including RPS25 and RPL41, and the inhibitory effecton these two proteins are also benefit to tumorigenesis.22,23These results suggest that the N-terminus of NCL may promotetumor-suppressive ribosomal proteins expression to counteractthe oncogenic effect of TNCL containing the RNA-bindingdomains and the C-terminus. Such speculation requiressubstantiation in future studies. In conclusion, here we identifieda new function of MMP7: MMP7 cleaves NCL, generating atruncated protein that contributes to lung cancer formation bypromoting oncogenes expression of several oncogenes andtumor-suppressor genes.MATERIALS AND METHODSCollection of specimens from lung cancer patientsThe study using human specimens was approved by the Clinical ResearchEthics Committee at National Cheng-Kung University Medical Center(Tainan, Taiwan). After surgical resection at National Cheng-KungUniversity Hospital, specimens of patients with lung adenocarcinomaswere collected for immunohistochemical analysis or western blotting. Thepathological data were analyzed by clinical pathologists.ImmunohistochemistryThe experimental process of immunohistochemistry was performed asdescribed in our previous study.20 Briefly, blocked histological sectionswere stained with the anti-c23, anti-MMP7 (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA) oranti-MMP9 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA).The immunoreactivity was detected by a Vectastain ABC kit (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).Site-directed mutagenesisThe GFP-NCL-myc plasmid was used as the template for mutagenesis.Primers were listed in Supplementary Table S2. Mutagenesis PCRwas performed using plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase (AgilentTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).Xenograft modelThe experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee at National Cheng-Kung University. After transfectionof H1299 cells with GFP, GFP-NCL or GFP-TNCL for 24 h, cells wereimplanted into the back of athymic nude mice (five mice per group) on day0. On day 10, tumor size was measured by calipers every 2 days until day32 according to our previous study.44In vivo metastatic assayGFP-, GFP-NCL- or GFP-TNCL-expressed CL1-5 cells (1 \u00d7 106) were injectedinto the left tail vein of severe combined immunodeficient mouse (six miceper group). After 30 days, lungs were excised and tumor nodules on lungsurface were counted.MMP7 cleavage assay by mass spectrometryThe peptide consisting of aa 252\u2013aa 262 of NCL (DDEDDDDEDDE) wassynthesized by Genomics Bio Sci and Tech, Ltd. (New Taipei City, Taiwan). Onemicrogram of the peptide was incubated with 20 or 200 ng of recombinanthuman protein MMP7 (PROSPEC, East Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C inthe reaction buffer containing 25mM Tris (pH 9.0), 2.5 \u03bcM ZnCl2 and 0.005%Brij-35. Subsequently, the mixture was diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid andco-spotted onto the stainless steel plate (Bruker Daltonik Gmbh, Karlsruhe,Germany) with matrix solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The samples wereanalyzed by Autoflex III MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonik Gmbh).Western blottingAfter electrophoresis and the transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoridemembrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), proteins were probed by theanti-c23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-Sp1(Millipore), anti-myc (Millipore), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.),anti-N-terminal NCL (Kelowna, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-MMP7 (AnaSpec), anti-MMP9 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-tubulin (Sigma) or anti-\u03b2-actin(Sigma) antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After the incubation with the secondaryantibody (Millipore), goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin Glinked with horseradish peroxidase, immune complex was detected usingchemiluminescence Alpha Innotech detection system (Alpha InnotechCorp., San Leandro, CA, USA). The alphaImager software (Alpha InnotechCorp.) was used to quantify the intensity of bands on western blotting.Statistical analysisThe difference between two groups was analyzed by Student\u2019st-test. Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to evaluate the survival curve,and the comparison of two survival curves was analyzed by log-rank test.The comparison of tumor volume in severe combined immunodefi-cient mice was performed by two-way analysis of variance. The P-value,which is o0.05, was considered as statistically significant.Figure 8. The proposed model to explain the role of NCL in lungtumor malignanct.
