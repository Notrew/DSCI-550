In this study, we tried to further investigate the potentialroles of Tiam1 in the progression of HCC in a larger set of samples. By detecting Tiam1 expression in 213 HCC patients, weobserved that Tiam1 had a higher probability of being overexpressed in HCC patients with metastasis than those withoutmetastasis (68.3% vs. 52.7%, p 5 0.036). In addition, the cell line with high metastatic potential expressed more Tiam1 thandid the cell line with low metastatic potential. Overexpression of Tiam1 was suggested to be significantly correlated with HCCmetastasis. We stably upregulated Tiam1 expression in MHCC97L as well as knocked down Tiam1 expression in HCCLM6. Wealso investigated the effects of Tiam1 overexpression and knockdown on HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasionin vitro and on tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of Tiam1 increased proliferation, migration and invasionof MHCC97L cells, while knockdown of Tiam1 in HCCLM6 cells resulted in the reverse. In vivo functional studies showedupregulation of Tiam1 expression led to an enhancement of tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in mice. However,knockdown of Tiam1 expression exhibited nearly 2.2-fold retardation in tumor growth and great inhibition on tumormetastases. Our results indicate that Tiam1, as a metastasis-related gene, may contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis,and consequently, it may be a useful biomarker for therapeutic strategy and control in HCC treatment.It is of great importance to elucidate the molecular mecha-nisms that control hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metasta-sis for a successful treatment. Previous investigations haveimplicated several genes associated with HCC metastasis,including ephrinA2,1 chemokine receptor CXCR7,2 CLU3 andCHD1L.4 However, there is little research on the associationof T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) withHCC.Tiam1, a member of the Dbl gene family of guanine nu-cleotide exchange factors (GEFs), was first identified by pro-viral tagging in combination with in vitro selection for inva-siveness from murine leukemia cells.5 It mediates a broadrange of cellular processes, including cellular migration andadhesion. Alterations in Tiam1 expression/function may con-tribute to tumorigenesis and carcinoma progression of com-mon types of human cancer.6\u20138 Tiam1 overexpressed in can-cers is considered to be a new potential or even anindependent predictor of poor prognosis for clinical patients.Many recent reports support that Tiam1 is a metastasis-related gene of a variety of cancers, such as breast cancer,9,10colorectal cancer (CRC),11,12 prostate cancer,13 lung cancer,14Ras-induced skin tumors15 and renal cell carcinoma.16 How-ever, we failed to observe the link between Tiam1 and HCCmetastasis. Moreover, little attention has been paid to theTiam1 functions in HCC.In our previous study,17 we noticed overexpression ofTiam1 in HCC cell lines as well as in HCC tissues both attranscriptional and translational levels. The overall survival ofour study cohort was significantly poorer in cases withTiam1 high expression than in low expression cases, indicat-ing Tiam1 expression is a significant and independent prog-nostic parameter for HCC patients. Tiam1 was considered tobe related to many cancer metastases.

Cancer: 132, 90\u2013100 (2013) VC 2012 UICCInternational Journal of CancerIJCshowed no significant association between Tiam1 and HCCmetastasis, we noticed the COX proportional-hazard analysisgave an estimated p value of 0.088, very close to 0.05, whichmight suggest a possible correlation between them. In ourstudy, to further investigate whether Tiam1 may be correlatedwith HCC metastasis or not, we enlarged our study cohortby collecting another 61 tissue samples from randomizedHCC patients who had been followed up for >5 years. Withgreat interest, we found Tiam1 was significantly associatedwith HCC metastasis after an increase in clinical tissue sam-ples. To further confirm our finding, we identified the biolog-ical functions of Tiam1 in HCC by a comprehensive range offunctional experiments.Material and MethodsPatients and tissue samplesWe extended our analysis to a larger sample set. In additionto the cohort of our previous study whose clinical data wereonce again used for our study, another 61 primary HCC tis-sue samples were taken randomly from patients who had notbeen pretreated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior tohepatectomy at General Hospital of Guangzhou MilitaryCommand of PLA, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China between1999 and 2002. All the tissue samples were fixed in 10% for-malin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned consecutively at 4 lmand stained by hematoxylin and eosin. The histological typeswere assigned according to the criteria of the World HealthOrganization Classification.Cell lines and culture conditionsThe two human HCC cell lines, MHCC97L and HCCLM6 wereobtained from Liver Cancer Institute and Zhongshan Hospitalof Fudan University, Shanghai, China. These two clonal cellstrains were derived from the same parent cell MHCC97 toensure a similar genetic background and yet dramatic differen-ces in spontaneous metastatic behavior. Compared withMHCC97L, which was not metastatic via subcutaneous inocu-lation but exhibited a metastatic rate of 40% via orthotopicinoculation, HCCLM6 featured more overt multidirectionalmetastasis.18 An immortalized normal hepatocyte cell line, HL-7702, was purchased from Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute ofBiochemistry & Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences(Shanghai, China). All cells were maintained in high glucoseDMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum(Hyclone). All the media were supplemented with 100 U/mlpenicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and incu-bated at 37\ufffdC in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2.Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assayImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to study alteredprotein expression in the additional 61 human HCC tissues.The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated after beingdried at 65\ufffdC for 2\u20134 hr. Heated-induced epitope retrievalwas carried out in 0.01 M, pH 6.0 sodium citrate buffer in amicrowave oven for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activitywas blocked with 0.3% H2O2 methanol while nonspecificbinding with 5% normal goat serum. Incubation with pri-mary antibody (rabbit anti-Tiam1, Santa Cruz) (1:100) wasperformed at 4\ufffdC overnight. Following incubation with bio-tinylated secondary antisera, the streptavidin-biotin complex/horseradish peroxidase was applied. Finally, the slide-mounted sections were stained with 3,30-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride and counterstained with hematoxylin.For immunofluorescence assay, cultured cells were grownon polylysine-treated slides overnight at 37\ufffdC. The cells werefixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked with PBSbuffer containing 5% BSA, and then incubated with rabbitanti-Tiam1 (1:100) at 4\ufffdC overnight followed by a FITC-con-jugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz,1:100 dilution) and a nuclear counterstain DAPI. After beingrinsed, the stained cells were analyzed using immunofluores-cence microscopy.Evaluation of immunohistochemical stainingStaining for Tiam1 protein in tumor tissues was scored by asemiquantitative analysis as described previously.17 Briefly,the staining intensity was scored as \u2018\u20180\u2019\u2019 (not stained), \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019(weakly stained), \u2018\u20182\u2019\u2019 (moderately stained) or \u2018\u20183\u2019\u2019 (stronglystained). The staining extent was scored as \u2018\u20180\u2019\u2019 (0%), \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 (1\u201310%), \u2018\u20182\u2019\u2019 (11\u201350%), \u2018\u20183\u2019\u2019 (51\u201380%) or \u2018\u20184\u2019\u2019 (81\u2013100%). Immu-noreactive scores were calculated by multiplying staining in-tensity score \ufffd staining extent score and divided into fourdifferent stages, ranging from 0 to 12.Establishment of Tiam1 overexpressed cellsHA (hemagglutinin)-tagged C1199-Tiam1 was a kind giftfrom John G. Collard. It encodes for the C-terminal 1,199amino acids of the Tiam1 protein, while the endogenous pro-tein is 1,591 amino acids.19 Previous results have demon-strated that this truncated construct does not inhibit growthand contains the majority of the domains of the full-lengthconstruct. The HA-Tiam1-1199 cDNA was cloned into thepCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and amplified. DNAsequencing and restriction enzyme digestion were used toconfirm the sequence was correct. pCDF1-Tiam1\u00fe-copGFPwas generated by inserting the cloned C1199-Tiam1 intopCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP vector (System Bioscience). Theregenerated expression plasmids were transfected into 293FTcells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were incubated in a 5%CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\ufffdC for one night, andchanged for fresh 10% fetal bovine serum. Viral supernatantwas harvested 48 hr after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-lm cellulose acetate filter, and frozen at \ufffd80\ufffdC. The lentivi-rus containing the C1199-Tiam1 cDNA was used as a positivecontrol, while the lentivirus-only-containing pCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP mock vector was used as a negative control.MHCC97L cells were seeded in 24-well plates to 30\u201340%confluence and transfected with viral supernatant containingexogenous Tiam1 cDNA and negative control lentivirus,EarlyDetectionandDiagnosisHuang et al. 91Int. J. Cancer: 132, 90\u2013100 (2013) VC 2012 UICCrespectively. After 12 hr of incubation, the medium waschanged for fresh 10% FBS according to the cells\u2019 state. Theexpression of report gene copGFP was examined after 3\u20134days transfection. Flow cytometry assays were applied to sortthe cells expressing copGFP and their corresponding negativecontrol. These two groups of cells were purified with limiteddilution cloning, identified by real-time PCR, Western blotand immunofluorescence confocal analysis. The cloneexpressing the highest level of Tiam1 was termed97L/Tiam1\u00fe, while its negative one termed 97L/mock.Establishment of Tiam1 knockdown cellsBased on Genbank information of Tiam1, four different RNAinterfering sequences were designed (http://ranidesigner.invitro-gen.com/sirna) and chemically synthesized (GeneChem, Shang-hai, China). The oligoduplexes were inserted into the pGCSIL-GFP vector. A total of 293FT cells were co-transfected with thepGCSIL-GFP-Tiam1 expression vector, pHelper1.0 andpHelper2.0 to produce virus particles. The viral supernatant washarvested 48 hr after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-lmfilter, before the viral titer was determined. The lentiviruscontaining shRNA-expressing cassette (sequence 50-TTCTCGAACGTGTCACGT-30) was used as a negative control.HCCLM6/EGFP cells were transduced with specific ornegative control lentiviral vectors and selected for stable inte-grant by limited dilution cloning. Identified by real-timePCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal analy-sis, the clone with the lowest Tiam1 expression was termedM6/Tiam1\u00fe, while its negative one termed M6/mock.RNA extraction and reverse transcription PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Takara,Dalian, China). cDNA was synthesized by oligo dT primedreverse transcription from 1 lg of total RNA using a reversetranscriptase cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Dalian, China). ForqPCR analysis, aliquots of double-stranded cDNA wereamplified using a SYBR Green PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian,China) and 7500 real-time PCR system (AB Applied Biosys-tems). In brief, the reaction mixture (total volume 20 ll)containing 500 ng cDNA, the forward primer 50-AAGACG-TACTCAGGCCATGTCC-30, and the reverse primer 50-GACCCAAAT GTCGCAGTCAG-30 was used to amplify a252-bp PCR product for human Tiam1 (GeneBank,NM_003253). The cycling parameters were 94\ufffdC for 40 s,58\ufffdC for 40 s and 72\ufffdC for 34 s for 40 cycles. Experimentswere repeated at least three times to ensure the reproducibil-ity of the results. Human b-actin gene was amplified as anendogenous control. The PCR products were observed byelectrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized after stain-ing with ethidium bromide. Comparative quantification wasdetermined using the 2\ufffdDDCt method.20Western blotWestern blot analysis was performed as previouslydescribed.17 Data were presented as mean 6 SD (n \u00bc 3).MTT assayCells were plated in 96-well plates at 5 \ufffd 103 cells per well. Afterincubation for one day, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphe-nyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed by adding20 ll of MTT (5 mg/ml, Promega) to the medium. The mediumwere removed 4 hr later when MTT incubation had been com-pleted and 150 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was added intoeach well, rocking for 10 min. The absorbance of each well wasmeasured using a microplate reader set at 570 nm. All experi-ments were performed in triplicate.Clone formationTarget HCC cells, as well as their control cells, were added todifferent wells of a six-well culture plate at a final density of 1\ufffd 102 cells. After incubation for 2 weeks at 37\ufffdC, plated cellswere washed twice with PBS and stained with Giemsa solu-tion. Colonies (\ufffd50 cells as a clone) were counted under adissecting microscope [plate clone formation efficiency \u00bc(number of colonies/number of cells inoculated) \ufffd 100%]. Allexperiments were independently repeated at least three times.Cell cycle analysisCells were harvested at logarithmic growth phase, fixed with75% ice-cold ethanol for overnight and washed twice withPBS. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, 100 ll PBSwith 0.1% RNase and 500 ll PI (10 lg/ml) were added tostain the cells at dark condition, 37\ufffdC for 30 min. The fluo-rescence of DNA-bound PI in cells was measured with aFACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Ger-many). Each staining experiment was repeated three times.The results were analyzed with DNA MultiCycle software.Wound healing and invasion assayCell migration ability was assessed by measuring the move-ment of cells into a scraped cellular area created by a 10 llpipette tube when cells were grown to 80\u201390% confluence insix-well culture plates. The phase contrast images of thewounds were recorded of 0, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 108 hr andthree separate experiments were performed. Cells transfectedwith empty vector and the parental cells were served as con-trols. Cell invasion assays were performed in 24-well trans-wells (8-lm pore size; Chemicon). The cell invasion chambercontains a thin layer of ECMatrix, which occludes membranepores, blocking noninvasive cells from migrating. First, se-rum-free medium was added to the top chamber to rehydratethe ECM layer for 2 hr at 37\ufffdC. A total of 1 \ufffd 105 cells sus-pended in a serum-free medium were then added to theupper chamber, while 10% FBS was placed in the lowerchamber as chemoattractant. After 24 hr of incubation, non-invasive cells remaining in the upper chamber were removedby cotton swabs. Cells on the lower surface of the membranewere fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin. Cellswere counted and photographed in at least six randommicroscopic fields. All experiments were repeated three times.EarlyDetectionandDiagnosis92 The role of Tiam1 in HCC metastasisInt. J. Cancer: 132, 90\u2013100 (2013) VC 2012 UICCIn vivo tumorigenicityFemale/male athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice of 4- to 6-week-old were purchased from the Central Laboratory of AnimalScience at Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China)and maintained in laminar-flow cabinets under specificpathogen-free conditions. To confirm mock virus-transducingwould not affect tumorigenicity, 5 \ufffd 106 targeted parentalHCC cells and mock virus-transduced cells were injected sub-cutaneously into both flanks of nude mice first. For evalua-tion of the in vivo tumor growth, a total of 5 \ufffd 106 targetedcells, showing either knockdown or overexpression of Tiam1,were then inoculated subcutaneously into both flanks of nudemice. Tumor sizes were measured every 5 days by a digitalcaliper to calculate the tumor volume using the formula V \u00bcL \ufffd W \ufffd H/2 (V, volume; L, length; W, width; H, height).Fluorescence emitted by cells was collected and imagedthrough a whole-body green fluorescence protein (GFP)imaging system (Lighttools, Encinitas, CA). Real-time tumorgrowth was visualized for at least 30 days using IPP5.0 soft-ware. The experiments were performed in three mice in eachtreatment group.In vivo metastasisWe employed the tail vein injection assay to assess the effectof Tiam1 on tumor metastasis. Cells were harvested by tryp-sinization, washed thrice with serum-free medium and resus-pended in serum-free medium. A total of 5 \ufffd 106 97L/Tiam1\u00fe, M6/Tiam1\ufffd and their mock cells were injected intothe tail veins of nude mice respectively. Each treatment groupcontained six mice. Whole-body optical imaging observedreal-time primary tumor growth and long-distance metasta-sis. Two months later, the mice were euthanized. The tumorswere excised and checked by hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E)staining.Statistical analysisBased on the clinic data of the 152 HCC samples in our pre-vious study and the additional 61 HCC ones in our study (atotal of 213 samples), the correlations of Tiam1 expression tovarious clinicopathological parameters were evaluated with v2test. SPSS 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RT-PCR, clone formation, cell cycle analysis and in vitro invasionassay were examined using one-way ANOVA. To test statisti-cal differences between in vitro cell proliferation and in vivotumorigenicity, multiple-factor repetitive measurement andanalysis of variance were performed. A p value less than 0.05was considered statistically significant.ResultsTiam1 expression in HCC tissues andclinicopathologic variablesOf 213 HCC tissue samples, 122 (57.3%) had a high expres-sion of Tiam1 (Tiam1 2\u00fe to 3\u00fe) and 91 (42.7%) a lowexpression (Tiam1 0 to 1\u00fe). Patients with metastasis had ahigher likelihood of high Tiam1 expression (43 of 63, 68.3%)compared with those without metastasis (79 of 150, 52.7%).No significant correlations were found between Tiam1expression level and any of the clinicopathologic variablesexcept for metastasis (p \u00bc 0.036) (Table 1).Tiam1 expression pattern in metastatic HCC cellsWe first examined the expression of Tiam1 in HL-7702,MHCC97L and HCCLM6 to investigate whether there wasany correlation between Tiam1 expression and the metastasispotential in HCC. As presented in Figure 1a, the level ofTiam1 mRNA in HCCLM6 was much higher than that inMHCC97L and HL-7702. No statistically significantTable 1.

TheWestern blot analysis had a result similar to that of RT-PCR.Tiam1 was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm ofcells. As expected, the highly metastatic cell line (HCCLM6)exhibited stronger signals of Tiam1 than the lowly metastaticcell line (MHCC97L). In HL-7702 cells, Tiam1 was almostundetectable (Fig. 1b). The Tiam1 expression pattern in thecell lines, as in the clinical samples, suggested its relationshipwith the invasion and metastasis nature of HCC.Alteration of Tiam1 expression regulated proliferation,migration and invasion capabilities of HCC cells in vitroWe successfully constructed three stable clones overexpress-ing Tiam1 from MHCC97L cells. Since the second clone(97L/T2, termed 97L/Tiam1\u00fe) was validated to exhibit thehighest expression level of Tiam1 as measured by qRT-PCR,western blot and immunofluorescence (Figs. 1c and 1d), itwas selected for further studies. We employed MTT assay todetect the effect of Tiam1 on cell growth. By comparing theFigure 1. Tiam1 expression on mRNA and protein levels in normal hepatocyte line and metastatic HCC cell lines. (a) qRT-PCR and Westernblot were performed to determine Tiam1 mRNA/protein expression in HL-7702, MHCC97L and HCCLM6; b-actin was used as a control.

Cancer: 132, 90\u2013100 (2013) VC 2012 UICCgrowth curves of 97L/Tiam1\u00feand its controls (97L parentaland 97L/mock), 97L/Tiam1\u00fe was found to significantly acceler-ate cell growth (Fig. 2a, left). Similarly, Tiam1 overexpressionpromoted colony formation of MHCC97L cells relative to pa-rental cells and cells transfected with empty vector (p < 0.05;Fig. 2b, left). Flow cytometry revealed that exogenous Tiam1introduction stimulated cell proliferation by accelerating cellcourse from G1 to S, which increased the proportion of S phase(p < 0.05, Fig. 2c). 97L parental cells showed cell cycle distribu-tion similar to that of 97L/mock cells. In a wound-healingassay, an evident acceleration in the wound closure rate wasobserved in 97L/Tiam1\u00fe cells at 72 hr compared with the con-trols (Fig. 3a, left). In the Matrigel invasion assay (Fig. 3b, left),the number of cells that passed through Matrigel were as two-fold higher than in the mock and parental cells (p < 0.05). Asexpected, Tiam1 overexpression was accompanied by theenhanced invasiveness of MHCC97L cells.The endogenous Tiam1 level in HCCLM6 was stablyknocked down by transfecting small interfering RNA (Figs. 1eand 1f). Contrary to the effect of Tiam1 overexpression, down-regulation of endogenous Tiam1 in HCCLM6 cells suppressedthe growth and colony formation compared with their controls(Figs. 2a and 2b, right). Cell cycle analysis indicated a decreaseof cell ratio in S period (Fig. 2c, right). Furthermore, obviousdelay in wound closure and reduction of invasion wereobserved in HCCLM6 cells with Tiam1 knockdown (Fig. 3,right).Tiam1 enhanced tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivoAs we expected, no significant difference was found in tumorgrowth between the parental cells and the ones transfectedwith empty vector, which indicated that mock virus-transduc-ing had little effect on cells tumorigenicity (data not shown).We subsequently observed that injection of 97L/Tiam1\u00fe with aFigure 2. Effect of Tiam1 on cell growth, colony formation and cell cycle of HCC cells. (a) MTT assay showed that overexpression of Tiam1in MHCC97L cells accelerated cells growth, while inhibition of Tiam1 expression in HCCLM6 cells significantly reduced cell viabilitycompared with the controls. (b) MHCC97L cells overexpressing Tiam1 formed more colonies compared with parental cells or empty vector-transduced cells. HCCLM6 cells silencing Tiam1 formed fewer colonies compared with parental or mock cells. (c) Increased Tiam1expression in MHCC97L cells accelerated the proliferation ability, characterized by an increased proportion of cells in the S phase. Incontrast, Tiam1 silencing cells (M6/Tiam1\ufffd) showed an S phase reduction. The difference was statistically significant. *p < 0.05(compared with both parental and mock groups).EarlyDetectionandDiagnosisHuang et al. 95Int. J.

On the other hand, knockdown of Tiam1expression exhibited nearly 2.2-fold retardation in tumorgrowth in vivo (Fig. 5a) by day 30 after injection.In the tail veins injection assay, 50% (3 of 6) of themice injected with 97L/Tiam1\u00fe cells developed lungFigure 3.

In contrast, downregulation ofendogenous Tiam1 in HCCLM6 resulted in inhibition ofdistant organs metastasis. All of the mice injected with M6/mock cells (all of 6) developed lung and bone metastasis,while 83.3% (5 of 6) developed liver metastasis (Figs. 5band 5c). In the knockdown group, however, no visible met-astatic lesion was observed other than a smaller, less visiblelung tumor and a case of bone metastasis which were foundin one of the six mice (16.7%, 1 of 6). All these resultsindicate the metastatic ability was significantly suppressedby silencing Tiam1 expression.DiscussionThe long-term survival of HCC patients remains unsatisfac-tory because of its high incidence of recurrence and metasta-sis after hepatic resection.21 Thus, identification of effectivebiomarkers for HCC patients is certainly a great concern ofmedical researchers.As an intense interest of current research, Tiam1 has beenproposed as a potentially effective biomarker for a variety ofcancers. Many researchers concluded that Tiam1 might be ametastasis-related gene, and consequently in clinic, it canserve as a predictor for therapeutic outcome or prognosis ofthe tumor patients. In our previous study, Tiam1 expressionwas concluded to be a novel and independent predictor ofprognosis of HCC patients. This conclusion is in accordancewith other Tiam1 investigations in patients with a variety ofcancers. However, contrary to many other studies, we failedFigure 4.

We have been questioning thisresult because more and more investigations have confirmedthe role of Tiam1 in inducing invasion and metastasis inmore and more cancers. It is unlikely that HCC is an excep-tion. In an attempt to resolve this doubt, we enlarged ourclinical tissue samples without any statistical bias in ourstudy. The statistical analysis of our new set of tissue samplesyielded encouraging and compatible results: Tiam1 had ahigher probability of being overexpressed in HCC patientswith metastasis than those without metastasis, and high Tiam1protein level was still a significant prognostic factor for poorFigure 5.

Cancer: 132, 90\u2013100 (2013) VC 2012 UICCoverall survival in HCC patients. These suggest that Tiam1overexpression may be associated with metastasis of HCC.To confirm this finding, we compared Tiam1 expression intwo HCC cell lines of different metastatic potential (see \u2018\u2018Mate-rial and Methods\u2019\u2019 section). As shown in the Results section,the cell line with high metastatic potential contained moreTiam1 mRNA/protein than did the cell line with low metastaticpotential. This also means that cells with higher metastaticpotential express more Tiam1, which is consistent with thefindings in colon,22,23 breast10 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma24cell lines. Tiam1 is considered to play various roles in regulatingcellular functions depending on specific cell type, substratumand other factors. It has been shown to promote motility insome neuronal cells,25 to increase cellular migration in fibro-blasts26 and to increase invasion in T-lymphoma cells,5 but toinduce cellular adhesion (as opposed to cellular migration) insome epithelial cell populations.27 In addition, Tiam1 expres-sion was found, in renal cell carcinoma cell lines, to be inverselycorrelated with invasive potential, although downregulation ofTiam1 alone was not sufficient to confer an invasive pheno-type.28 Although many studies have been performed to deter-mine the functional features of Tiam1 in different tumors, littleattention has been paid to the regulation of Tiam1 in HCC. Tofurther testify the role of Tiam1 in HCC, a series of relevantfunctional experiments, from positive to negative, as well asfrom in vitro to in vivo, were performed in our study.A previous study demonstrated that the two cell linesderived from the same host cell line, MHCC97L andHCCLM6, could provide an ideal cell model system for thestudy of HCC metastasis.29 By using retroviral gene transfermethod, a means that can not only stably integrate the geneof interest into the target cell genome but also provide along-term gene expression, we constructed two target celllines: HCCLM6 silencing Tiam1 and MHCC97L overexpress-ing Tiam1. We thus observed an association of upregulationof Tiam1 with promotion of cell proliferation, migration andinvasion in vitro, as well as an association of knockdown ofTiam1 with the reverse. Upregulation of Tiam1 expression inMHCC97L cells led to an enhancement of tumorigenicityand metastatic potential in mice, while downregulation ofTiam1 expression in HCCLM6 cells was related to suppres-sion of tumorigenicity and tumor metastases in vivo. A simi-lar relationship between Tiam1 knockdown and metastasiswas reported in CRC cell line.22 All the results of the func-tional experiments are in agreement with the finding derivedfrom our statistical analyses. By demonstrating the potentialrole of Tiam1 in HCC cell lines, we hope our study will pro-vide a new insight into Tiam1 in HCC metastasis.In our study, although we found a definite associationbetween overexpression of Tiam1 and metastasis of HCC, theunderlying mechanisms are unclear. Engers et al.28 ever stud-ied the mutation status of Tiam1 in renal cell carcinoma.Unfortunately, only a low frequency of point mutation wasfound in their study, which cannot fully explain the abnor-mal expression of Tiam1 in the cancer. Aberrant DNA meth-ylation frequently occurs in initiation and development ofhuman cancer. Ding et al.,11 another team investigatingTiam1 in our laboratory, tried to elucidate the mechanismsfrom the epigenetic modification and demonstrated that over-expression of Tiam1 was associated with hypomethylationstatus of Tiam1 promoter region in CRC tissues, though nostatistical relationship between Tiam1 methylation and cancermetastasis could be found. Specific hypomethylation of pro-moters of cancer-related genes was recently shown in HCCin genomewide/candidate gene studies and some meaningfulresults were obtained.30,31 All these attempts addressing themechanisms that may regulate expression of Tiam1 in carci-nomas require further in depth research in the future.In summary, our study modified a doubtful result of ourprevious study by demonstrating a significant associationbetween metastasis and Tiam1 overexpression in HCC. All ofour functional experiments confirmed a metastasis-promotingfunction of Tiam1 in HCC. The preferential overexpressionof Tiam1 in HCC patients with metastasis suggests thatTiam1 may be a significant biomarker of HCC progression.Inhibitors targeting Tiam1 would give considerable therapeu-tic potentials in the treatment of HCC. Thus, future experi-ments on Tiam1 are certainly required to better understandthe progression and metastasis of HCC as well as to confirmthe pharmaceutical significance of Tiam1.References1.
