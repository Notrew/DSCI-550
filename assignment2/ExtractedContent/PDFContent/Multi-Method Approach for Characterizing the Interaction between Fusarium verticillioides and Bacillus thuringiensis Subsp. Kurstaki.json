Bacillus thuringiensis is considered a good alternative as a biocontrol agent for suppressing plantpathogens such as Fusarium. In this study, we used microscopy, flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorescence, and highperformance liquid chromatography to determine the interaction between B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki LFB-FIOCRUZ(CCGB) 257 and F. verticillioides MRC 826, an important plant pathogen frequently associated with maize. B. thuringiensisshowed a strong in vitro suppressive effect on F. verticillioides growth and inhibited fumonisin production. Flow cytometryanalysis was found to be adequate for characterizing the fungal cell oscillations and death during these interactions. Furtherstudies of the antagonistic effect of this isolate against other fungi and in vivo testing are necessary to determine theefficacy of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki in controlling plant pathogens. This is the first report on the use of flow cytometryfor quantifying living and apoptotic F. verticillioides cells and the B. thuringiensis Cry 1Ab toxin.Citation: Rocha LO, Tralamazza SM, Reis GM, Rabinovitch L, Barbosa CB, et al.

Theinfluence of abiotic and biotic factors, in addition to themorphological and genetic characteristics of maize, enables theconversion from an endophyte to a pathogen [2,3]. This fungusalso has the potential to produce several mycotoxins, primarilyfumonisins, which are known to cause equine leukoencephaloma-lacia, pulmonary edema in swine, and cancer in rodents [4]. Theconsumption of fumonisin-contaminated grains is also associatedwith human esophageal cancer and neural tube defects in someregions of the world [5,6].Due to economic losses regarding F. verticillioides (Fv) contam-ination and the risks of fumonisin ingestion, many efforts havebeen made to control this fungus [7]. Resistant crop varieties,biological methods, and principally fungicides have been em-ployed to manage Fv contamination; nevertheless, Fusarium strainsexhibit a remarkable capacity to adapt and to become resistant tothese strategies [8].Pesticides have increased crop resistance for over four decades;nonetheless, the emerging, re-emerging, and endemic plantpathogens are still challenging crop safety worldwide [9,10].Moreover, chemicals may leave residues in grains, fruits,vegetables, and soil that may be harmful to the ecosystems andhuman health. The development of environmentally friendly crop-management practices for combating diseases represents a difficulttask. The use of bacterial antagonists such as Bacillus [11\u201314],Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces [15,16] as biocontrol agents (BCAs) isconsidered one of the most rational practices as part of anintegrated management program to reduce pesticides in theenvironment [14,17].Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a ubiquitous gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that produces parasporal crystals containinginsecticidal proteins called crystal (Cry) or cytolytic (Cyt) toxins.This bacterium is found in a wide variety of habitats such as soils,dead and living insects, the plant phylloplane, and as anendophyte. The high abundance of Bt strains is attributed to itslong-lasting spore viability [18,19], ability to assimilate nutrientsfrom diverse macromolecules [20], and its quorum sensing-regulated existence that can lead the bacterium from a virulentto a necrotrophic state [21]. Bt strains are classified according tothe serological response differences in their flagellar antigens, andthere are at least 71 serotypes and 84 subspecies [22,23]. B.thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk), which produces lepidopteran-insecticidal Cry 1A proteins, including Cry 1Ab, is the mostcommonly employed strain used as a bioinsecticide againstlepidopteran pest larvae [24].PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189\u02dcSao \u02dc Sao \u02dchttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092189&domain=pdfAlthough many studies have focused on the activity of B.thuringiensis insecticidal proteins, the bacterium may also act as apotential BCA against a variety of plant pathogens due to itsproduction of antimicrobial molecules, including zwittermicin A,chitinases, chitin-binding proteins, and quorum sensing-quenchingenzymes [14,20,25,26]. Together with chitinases, chitin-bindingprotein facilitates microbial attachment to fungal cell walls, whichdisrupts the cell polarity and leads to inhibition of cell growth.Previous studies have also demonstrated that Bt spore germinationand vegetative cell growth were associated with the developmentof fungal hyphae in the soil. Furthermore, vegetative cells havebeen observed growing with the fungal mycelia, likely due to theability of Bacillus species to cause the death of the fungus and thussurvive the hyphal lysis products [27].The aim of this study was to characterize the in vitro interactionof F. verticillioides and B. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki based on amulti-method approach. To our knowledge, this is the first reportof the use of flow cytometry to quantify living and necrotic fungalcells and the Cry 1Ab toxin during the time-course of interactionbetween Btk and Fv.Materials and MethodsBacterial and fungal strains and their growth conditionsF. verticillioides MRC 826 [Programme on Mycotoxins andExperimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC), Tygerberg, Republic ofSouth Africa] was obtained from a culture growing on SpeziellerNa\u0308hrstoffarmer agar by monosporic isolation and was used in allexperiments. This isolate is capable of producing high levels offumonisins [28]. The fungal strain was inoculated onto V8 agar inPetri dishes and incubated under continuous fluorescent whitelight for 7 days at 25uC in a BOD incubator (Thermo Scientific,Wilmington, DE), after which the colony surface was gentlyscraped off and transferred to a tube containing 50 mL of steriledistilled water. The spores were counted with a hemocytometer,and the concentration was adjusted to 16106 spores/mL [29].Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257,which produces the Cry 1A toxin group, was provided by Dr.Leon Rabinovitch from the Culture Collection of Bacillus andRelated Genera (CCGB; Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro,Brazil). This Btk strain was isolated from moist soil from theMorretes Village, Paranagua\u0301, Parana\u0301 State, Brazil prior to 1995. Itwas identified and characterized by Dr. Leon Rabinovitch and Dr.Tania V. Guaycurus at the Bacterial Physiology Laboratory in theOswaldo Cruz Institute in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute,Paris, France. The LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain exhibitsproteolytic and amylolytic properties, is mesophilic, and producesa bi-pyramidal crystal. The serovar kurstaki (H3a, 3b, 3c), whichproduces flagellar antigens of serotype \u2018\u2018H3\u2019\u2019, was characterized bythe Pasteur Institute.The cultures were stored lyophilized; bacterial spores andcrystal biomass were obtained by inoculating Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ(CCGB) 257 into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 250 mL ofNutrient Broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) and incubat-ing at 30uC on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) for 72 h. The cultureswere centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4uC, and the cellpellets were stored at 220uC [30] until use. The proteinconcentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO), and measurements weremade with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE), using bovine serum albumin (BSA)as the standard [31]. A working solution of the Btk spore andcrystal biomass was made by diluting to 10 mg/mL, which was theminimum inhibitory concentration for Fv growth under ourlaboratory conditions (data not shown).About 50 mL of Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) was centrallyinoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) using a micropipette.After inoculum adsorption, 50 mL of Fv (16106 spores/mL) wascentrally inoculated onto each PDA Petri plate. PDA medium waschosen since it can provide for Fusarium species\u2019 growth, inaddition to bacterial growth. The microscopy, immunofluores-cence, and cytometry experiments were conducted with fivereplicates after 3, 5, and 7 days of incubation under continuouswhite-light illumination at 25uC. The radius measurements of thepure and mixed (Fv+Btk) cultures were recorded for 20 days for fivereplicates each, after which the presence of the fumonisins B1 andB2 was determined.Flow cytometry analysis for the quantification of fungalcellsFive replicates were analyzed after 3, 5, and 7 days ofincubation. The cultures were removed from the agar by scraping,transferred into a 50-mL tube containing sterile distilled water andTween 80 (2 drops/100 mL water), and centrifuged at 7000 rpmfor 20 min. The cells were rinsed with the Tween 80/watersolution twice and resuspended in 20 mL phosphate bufferedsaline (PBS), after which a 4 mL aliquot was filtered through a 70-mm mesh-sized cell strainer [Becton Dickinson and Company(BD), San Jose, CA] to obtain a uniform cell suspension. The cellsolution was stained with 10 mL of 1 mg/mL Calcofluor White(CFW; Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) at a final concentrationof 0.05 mg/mL CFW and stained with 5 mL of 7-aminoactino-mycin (7-AAD), utilizing the PE Annexin V Apoptosis DetectionKit (BD, San Jose, CA) per the manufacturer instructions. Thecells were incubated with CFW and 7-AAD in the dark for 15 minand stored on ice until the analysis.The living and necrotic fungal cells were quantified by flowcytometry performed using a FACS Canto II system (BD, SanJose, CA) equipped for CFW (lex, 365 nm; lem, 430 nm), usingviolet laser excitation (405 nm) with detection in the Pacific Bluechannel (405\u2013450/50 nm), and 7-AAD (lex, 546 nm; lem,647 nm), using blue laser excitation (488 nm) with detection inthe PerCP (peridinin chlorophyll A protein) channel (650 nm). Aminimum of 30,000 events per sample were acquired; the datawere collected using a linear representation for the side scatter(SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) and a logarithmic representationfor the fluorescent signals. The analyses were performed usingFlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). The necroticfungal cell population was gated to separate it from the deadbacterial cell population. For verifying Fv autofluorescence andcross reaction between the Btk and CFW, bacterial cells stainedwith CFW and fungal cells not labeled with the fluorochrome wereused as negative controls. For the 7-AAD negative controls, purecultures of living bacterial and fungal cells were stained with 7-AAD. The negative controls were utilized to determine thebackground of each fluorescent marker. For the 7-AAD positivecontrols, the bacterial and fungal cells were incubated at 100uC for30 min in a water bath [32,33].Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)After the incubation periods on PDA, 1-cm2portions of agarcontaining interaction regions of both microorganisms andsamples from pure fungal and bacterial cultures were fixed with2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4uC. The sampleswere rinsed with cacodylate buffer and fixed in 1% (w/v) osmiumInteraction between Fusarium and BacillusPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189tetroxide before dehydration in a graded series of ethanolconcentrations and embedment in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathinsections were collected on 200-mesh nickel grids coated withFormvar and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Thegrids were examined with a JEOL 1010 transmission electronmicroscope (JEOL, Tokyo). For each replicate, three ultrathinsections were examined [11].Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)The pure cultures and treatments were placed in a 40%glutaraldehyde solution for 24 h, dried at 42uC for at least 48 h,and fixed to appropriate aluminum bases. The material was thensputtered with gold and examined with a Leo-440i-SEM scanningelectron microscope (Leo electron microscopy, Cambridge, UK)[29].Indirect immunofluorescence assayPure and treated cultures of Fv and Btk were analyzed duringthe incubation period. The cells were removed by scraping,washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in PBS/BSA(1%) at room temperature before adding rabbit polyclonalantibody against Bt Cry 1Ab toxin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge,MA); the incubation was for 30 min in the dark under gentlerotation (60 rpm). The cells were washed three times with PBS/BSA and incubated with a goat polyclonal secondary antibody torabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000; Abcam, Cam-bridge, MA) under the same conditions. The cells were washedthree times with PBS/BSA and 10 mL of CFW (1 mg/mL) wasadded. The cells were resuspended in 40 mL of a solutioncomposed of glycerol (500 mL), PBS (400 mL) and n-propyl gallate(0.022 g) (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Slides were pre-pared and analyzed with an EVOS FL Cell Imaging System(Advanced Microscopy Group, Life Technologies, Foster City,CA) using the DAPI (diamidino-2-phenylindole) channel for CFWand the GFP (green fluorescence protein) channel for Alexa Fluor488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm). The background of eachfluorescent marker was determined with negative controls of theBtk, Fv, and Btk+Fv treatments incubated with the secondaryantibody, but not with the primary antibody. For the CFWcontrols, the bacterial cells were stained with the fluorochrome,while the fungal cells were not [34,35].Flow cytometry for quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxinsThe cells were treated as described above, but omitting theCFW staining. Quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxin was performedwith the FACS Canto II (BD, San Jose, CA) equipped for AlexaFluor 488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm) using blue laser excitation(488 nm) with detection in the FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)channel (530/30 nm). The collection and analysis were aspreviously described for the flow cytometry analysis of the fungalcells. For negative controls, the cells from all treatments wereincubated only with the secondary antibody [33].Fumonisin analysisFv (16106 spores/mL) and Fv plus Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) wereinoculated onto PDA (five replicates/treatment) and incubated at25uC for 20 days [12]. Fumonisins were extracted from the PDAculture with 100 mL of methanol and water (3:1, v/v) followed byshaking for 45 min. The samples were filtered through Whatmangrade 4 (12 cm) filter paper and the pH was corrected to pH 5.8\u20136.5 with 1 N NaOH, if necessary. The fumonisins were purified bytransferring 10 mL of the filtrate to a minicolumn containing500 mg of ion-exchange silica (BondElut SAX-Varian, Palo Alto,CA, USA) previously conditioned with 5 mL methanol and 5 mLmethanol/water (3:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Thefumonisins were eluted with 15 mL methanol/acetic acid (99:1, v/v), maintaining the same flow rate. The product was evaporatedand the residue was separated by high performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) and resuspended in 1 mL acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v). A 50-mL aliquot of the sample extract wasdiluted with 50 mL OPA reagent (40 mg ortho-phthalaldehydedissolved in 1 mL methanol, diluted with 5 mL 0.1 M sodiumtetraborate solution, and supplemented with 50 mL b-mercapto-ethanol) and shaken for 30 seconds. Two minutes after theaddition of the OPA reagent, the solution was injected into aShimadzu LC-10AD liquid chromatograph equipped with a20 mL fixed loop injector (Rheodyne, Rhonert Park, CA)[36,37]. After separation on a C-18 reverse phase column(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 5 ODS-20, 15064.6 mm), thefumonisins were detected with an RF-10AXL fluorescencedetector (lex, 335 nm; lem, 335 nm). An acetonitrile/water/aceticacid (96:104:1, v/v/v) solution was used for the mobile phase.Chromatography was conducted with column temperature of30uC, maintained in an oven, and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min,atroom temperature (22\u201323uC). The retention times of the FB1 andFB2 under these conditions were 9 and 20 min, respectively.Calibration curves were utilized for quantifying the fumonisin withcorrelation coefficients of 0.9927 (FB1) and 0.9950 (FB2). Thequantification limit was 0.015 mg/g for FB1 and FB2, and themean recoveries from five replicates for each were 92.38% (SD,13.68%) and 85.39% (SD, 6.87%) for FB1, and FB2, respectively.Statistical analysesStatistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA andTukey tests, as the data were normally distributed. The differenceswere considered significant when p-values were ,0.05. Thestatistical tests were conducted using Assistat software [38].ResultsAccuracy of flow cytometry analysis for quantification ofliving and dead Fv cells and Btk Cry 1Ab toxin during thetime course of interactionTo determine whether Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 couldbe a potential BCA against Fv, flow cytometry tests were used toidentify either apoptotic or living fungal cells. During the culturegrowth for the analyses, it was observed that Fv increased itsbiomass faster than did Btk on PDA medium, as demonstrated bythe average of three radius measurements of the colonies aloneversus those of interactions between Fv and Btk (five replicates)during the period of analysis (Figure 1). The use of CFW and 7-AAD fluorochromes was based on the ability of CFW to bind tothe cell wall chitin of both the living and dead fungus. The 7-AADpermeates the membrane of late-apoptotic and dead cells, andbinds to the DNA. Thus, it was possible to verify if the interactionled to fungal death or growth inhibition. Furthermore, through agating strategy, it was possible to distinguish between the bacterialand fungal populations undergoing apoptosis (Figure 2).Positive and negative controls were used to validate the flowcytometry conditions and to analyze the Fv and Btk interaction.This technique allowed for the quantification of live and deadfungal cells and the Cry 1Ab bacterial toxin in terms ofpercentages (Figure 2). Btk cells were stained with CFW withnegligible background detected (Figure 2a.1). Fv cells were alsostained with CFW, and almost 100% of the cells were counted(Figure 2a.3). Quadrants were defined based on positive andnegative fungal populations and a negative bacterial population forInteraction between Fusarium and BacillusPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189CFW (Figure 2A). For the 7-AAD, living bacterial, fungal, andbacterial plus fungal cells were used as negative controls(Figure 2b.1 and b.2). Quadrants were established after analyzingboth microorganisms and their interaction. Dead Fv and Btk cellswere observed as distinct populations since it was possible to selectthe Fv population by gating (Figure 2b.3 and b.4). Not all of thebacterial cells were in an apoptotic stage after 30 min at 100uC,which can be explained by the presence of spores and crystals thatare resistant to high temperatures and therefore not labeled by the7-AAD (Figure 2b.3 and b.4).Cry 1Ab was treated with an antitoxin antibody and stainedwith Alexa Fluor 488 in order to determine the crystal production,and consequently, the bacterial spore production during theanalysis period. The quadrants were delimited based on the dotplot graphic of the negative control for the Cry 1 Ab toxin(Figure 3A).In vitro suppressive effect of Btk against FvThe Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was found to showsignificant antagonistic activity against Fv from the second to thetwentieth day, based on the radius measurements of the fivereplicates (Figure 1). After 3, 5, and 7 days of interaction, thecolonies were viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in addition to theindirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses. After 3days of incubation, no marked changes were observed by TEM orSEM in the Fusarium cells (data not shown). On the fifth andseventh days, the Fusarium cells appeared damaged, as evidencedby cell-wall irregularities and by disorganization of the cytoplasm.In contrast, the Fv pure cultures showed intact hyphae andabundant microconidia formation when the colonies wereanalyzed by TEM (Figure 4A). In the SEM analysis, strong fungalcell wall thickening was seen in response to the interaction after 5and 7 days of incubation; sparse fungal growth and numerous Btkcells and spores were also discernible. As a result of the interaction,high numbers of Btk spores and cells were visualized between thehyphae and microconidia; the Btk pure culture producedvegetative cells in profusion (Figure 4B).Flow cytometry dot plot graphs demonstrated a significantreduction of the fungal cells from the third (10.93%) to the fifthday (4.19%; p,0.05), although the percentage of cells remainedvirtually the same from the fifth to the seventh day (3.48%).Interestingly, fungal cell death was observed on the seventh day ofincubation (5.23%), in agreement with the TEM and SEMobservations (Figure 2C). The fungal cultures alone showedirrelevant changes in the percentage of cells for the three periodsanalyzed.The immunofluorescence assay using CFW to stain the fungalcell walls allowed for the identification of many sectors of hyphalthickening on the fifth day, a characteristic that was remarkablynoted on the seventh day (Figure 5B). On the third day, a fewcrystals were observed and the fungal cells were basically intact(data not shown), but by the fifth and seventh days, crystalscontaining Cry 1Ab toxin were mostly free and in abundancethroughout the cultures (Figure 5B).By the end of the experiment, the treated cultures wereprimarily colonized by the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257strain, demonstrating its relevance as a BCA. The morphologicalalterations observed by TEM, SEM, and the immunofluorescenceassays subsequently confirmed the flow cytometry results. No suchchanges were noted in the control cultures.Effects of Btk Cry 1Ab productionThe production of the Cry 1Ab toxin by the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was analyzed after 3, 5, and 7days of incubation by utilizing specific antibodies followed byFigure 1. Effect of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) on the mycelial growth of Fusarium verticillioides (Fv). (A) Each bar is theaverage of three radius measurements (cm) of pure fungal colonies and the interaction of Fv and Btk (five replicates) during 20 days of growth onpotato dextrose agar. The differences were considered significant when P values were ,0.05, according to ANOVA and Tukey tests. Although therewere no significant differences between Fv+Btk and Btk, the average of the radius measurements were significantly reduced with Fv+Btk whencompared to Fv culture, from the second to the 20th day of incubation.; (B) aspect of the colonies after 3, 5, 7 and 20 days: Btk (b.1); Btk+Fv (b.2); andFv (b.3).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092189.g001Interaction between Fusarium and BacillusPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189analysis with flow cytometry. This experiment was conductedbased on the observations of the indirect immunofluorescenceassay, which was possible to visualize high quantity of the toxinand Btk spores all over the treated culture (Figure 5B). In Btkcontrol cultures was observed 10.02%, 11.67% and 17.31% of Cry1Ab toxins in 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively (Figure 3, B). Asignificant increase of Cry 1Ab toxins was verified in cultures withFv added to the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain incomparison to the control group (p,0.05). We observed 15.54%,20.86%, and 41.61% positivity rates on the third, fifth, andseventh days of incubation, respectively (Figure 3B).Impact of Btk on fumonisin B1 and B2 production by FvThe Fv strain produced lower levels of the fumonisins FB1 andFB2 during interactions with Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 for20 days. In the control group, the average production of FB1 andFB2 was 18.97 mg/g [relative standard deviation (RSD), 2.2%]and 0.86 mg/g (RSD, 1.2%), respectively. In the treated group, theaverage production of FB1 was 13.81 mg/g (RSD, 5.9%), whileFB2 was not detected in any replicate. The five replicates of thecontrol and treated groups were significantly different from oneanother (p,0.05).DiscussionThe aim of this study was to characterize the interactionbetween Fv and Btk based on the combined use of microscopy,flow cytometry, and HPLC techniques. We also presented apractical and effective approach to identify these interactions usingflow cytometry, which could be extended to other plant pathogensand antagonistic bacteria, thereby contributing to the ability todetermine the potential of microorganisms as possible BCAs.Flow cytometry has emerged as a high-resolution technologythat supports the characterization of individual cell types withinmixed populations. Cellular patterns can be identified by assessingthe protein expression using fluorescent probes and antibodiescoupled with fluorochromes [39]. This method provides ananalysis of a large number of cells and can identify changeswithin a population and between different populations [33].Consequently, it was possible to characterize Fv in terms of livingand dead cell percentages and identify the Cry 1Ab proteinproduced by Btk during the experimental period.Interaction studies of two or more microorganisms arechallenging because the populations are always changing overtime. In general, fungal and bacterial cells can grow and divide,Figure 2. Flow cytometry analysis for Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) interacting with Fusarium verticillioides (Fv).

B. thuringiensis forms aparasporal crystal during the stationary phase of its growth cycle;nevertheless, the co-culture can change the kinetics of bothmicroorganisms, imposing the need to mark each population tomonitor their outcome during the interaction.The fungal cells were labeled with the fluorochrome CFW thatbinds to chitin, a cell-wall polysaccharide that maintains the fungalcell integrity and confers structural rigidity during growth andmorphogenesis [40]. The concentration of CFW was determinedbased on the background fluorescence, as high concentrationlevels could be misinterpreted as a positive signal. The optimalconcentration was 0.05 mg/mL in 400 mL of the cell solution. Wealso evaluated the fungal cell autofluorescence by fluorescencemicroscopy and flow cytometry. The fungal cells showed negligibleautofluorescence emission, and therefore, no data normalizationwas required. Thus, the variation of CFW during the incubationperiod was interpreted as an increase or decrease of the number ofFv cells. Because CFW has the ability to stain both living and deadcells, the use of the 7-AAD fluorochrome was crucial todetermining whether the fungal cells were alive or in an apoptoticstage [39], as the 7-AAD binds only to late apoptotic and necroticcell DNA. The flow cytometry analysis was not conducted withboth markers in the same solution, however, as the CFW could bepartially detected in the PerCP channel, which would lead to anoverestimation of the 7-AAD positive reactions.The Btk cells were treated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to theBt Cry 1Ab toxin, and a goat polyclonal secondary antibody torabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, to quantify the Cry 1Abtoxin and determine the bacterial sporulation during the analysisperiod. Due to the parasporal characteristic of the crystals, whichare produced during the stationary phase of Bt growth [41], it ispossible to make an analogy between the crystal and sporeproduction. The flow cytometry analysis allowed for the charac-terization of the Cry 1Ab toxin in the Btk and Btk+Fv groups. Forboth groups, background fluorescence was absent when controlcells were treated only with the secondary antibody. ThisFigure 3. Flow cytometry analysis for quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxins.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of flowcytometry use for characterizing Cry 1Ab production.A strong in vitro antagonistic effect of the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ(CCGB) 257 strain on Fv MRC 826 was shown. Previous studieshave reported Bacillus spp. as potential biological controls of plantpathogenic fungi such as F. oxysporum, F. sambucinum, and F.graminearum [14,42\u201344]. In addition, other studies have shown thatthe activity of Bacillus spp. reduced Fv colonization and theaccumulation of fumonisin in corn [12,13,45,46].The microscopic examination by SEM and TEM revealed nomarked changes on the third day of incubation; however, theantagonistic effect was evident on the fifth and seventh days,showing fungal cell wall and cytoplasm damage in comparison tothe control Fv culture. Sectors of intumescent hyphae wereobserved in response to the bacterial effects, with a paucity offungal growth and numerous Bt cells seen in the SEM and indirectimmunofluorescence assays. In fact, swollen hyphae can beassociated with a decrease in fungal growth and higher levels ofnon-viable cells due to hyphal transformations and death resultingfrom Fusarium growth kinetics [47]. Another hypothesis is thechitin apposition in the fungal cell wall, due to the stress caused bythe effect of antagonistic bacteria. The extensive accumulation ofchitin is part of an intricate defense strategy by fungi forrestraining the penetration of pathogens and fungitoxic molecules[48,49]. Nonetheless, it has been reported that Bacillus spp. areable to overcome such barriers and cause severe fungal cell injuries[11]. The cell wall and cytoplasm damage visualized by TEM andthe profile of dead fungal cells observed by flow cytometry afterincubating Fv MRC 826 and Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257together for 7 days demonstrated that Bt strains can be veryaggressive towards fungi and are able to circumvent this fungaldefense strategy.Fungal endophytes such as Fusarium can reside in the internaltissues of living plants without causing any immediate or negativeeffect, but may turn pathogenic during host senescence. Theinteractions between host plants and endophytes in naturalpopulations are poorly understood; however, they can activelycompete against other microorganisms for niche or infection sites[50]. Fv is an endophyte and one of the most commonly reportedsoil-borne fungal pathogens infecting maize worldwide [12,51]. Ingeneral, soil-borne pathogens that infect through mycelial contactare more susceptible to competition from other soil microorgan-isms associated with plants than from pathogens that germinatedirectly on the plant surface [14,50]. Our in vitro resultscorroborate this theory, as Fv MRC 826 growth was restrictedby Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 for over 20 days. A reductionin the cell numbers in the treated cultures was also observed on thethird (10.93%), fifth (4.19%), and seventh (3.48%) days throughthe flow cytometry analysis.Figure 4. Microscopic observations of Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) in contact with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Fv and Btkwere co-cultured on potato dextrose agar and microscopically examined after 5 (5D) and 7 (7D) days of growth. Figure 4(A).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM): Fv cells from pure culture \u2013 scale bars: 10 mm and 20 mm (b.1); Btk cells from pure culture \u2013 scale bar:10 mm (b.2); intumescent hyphae and sparse fungal growth \u2013 scale bars: 5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm (b.3); and Btk spores and crystals around the hyphae\u2013 scale bars: 5 mm and 10 mm (b.4).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092189.g004Interaction between Fusarium and BacillusPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189The suppressive effect of Btk on Fv can also be correlated withsecreted inhibitory molecules. A number of antifungal compounds,including polypeptides that interact with the fungal membrane,are produced by Bacillus species [52]. Bt can secrete chitinases andchitin-binding proteins; together these proteins control fungi bybinding to cell wall chitin and disrupting the cell polarity, leadingto fungal growth inhibition, and thus conferring an advantage as acompetitor in its niche. Degraded chitin can also serve as anutrient and further contribute to Bt growth and proliferation[20,53,54]. Interestingly, it has been shown that a chitin-bindingprotein is expressed in spore mother cells that interact with Cry1Ac, potentiating the toxin activity [20].Our results showed increased levels of the Cry 1Ab toxin whenBtk was interacting with Fv. The accumulation of Cry 1ab wasenhanced during the interaction, particularly after 7 days ofincubation. This response probably occurred as a consequence ofthe stressful conditions during the Fv and Btk co-cultivation, whichmay promote more aggressiveness in this Btk isolate. Given that Btcrystals are produced concurrently with the spores, there was alsoan increase in spore production during the experimental period.Despite the controversial hypotheses about Bt spore longevity,some reports have demonstrated the environmental persistence ofBt spores, which confer resistance and a competitive advantageagainst other microorganisms [19,27].During the Fv and Btk interactions, less accumulation offumonisin was observed. Reduced FB1 levels have been reportedpreviously, when Fv was treated with Bacillus spp. in maize [12,13].In fact, reduced fumonisin levels were reported when the fungalbiomass was decreased [13,55,56]. Mycotoxin production hasbeen viewed as an adaptation of the fungus to stressfulenvironmental conditions and as providing an advantage incompetition with other microorganisms in its natural habitat [57].Some stressful conditions such as oxidative stress and nitrogenstarvation may enhance fumonisin production. However, thebenefit to the fungus from producing higher levels of fumonisinremains unclear [58,59].Figure 5. Interaction between Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) monitored byimmunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were treated as described in the Materials and Methods. Fungal cells were stained with CalcofluorWhite (CFW; blue fluorescence) and crystals containing Cry 1Ab toxin were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) after 3 (3D), 5 (5D) and 7(7D) days of interaction.

Moreover, flow cytometrywas demonstrated to be sensitive enough to characterize fungalcell oscillations and death during its interaction with Btk. Futurestudies regarding the antagonistic effect of this bacterium againstother fungi and in vivo tests are necessary to determine the efficacyof Btk in controlling plant pathogens.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Andrea Glatt for the technical assistance with the FACS Cantoand Joseani Teixeira Brito for training in Bacillus thuringiensis and Cry toxinidentification by SDS-PAGE.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: LOR BC LR.
