Ribosome construction requiresassembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA. As RPs co-assemble intoone multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in whichthe same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene. However, a more complex picture isemerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Herewe report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7Mtuand Rps7Zma) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has beenimplicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Rps7 disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, asdemonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency. Interestingly, Rps7 mutants haveadditional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes thatare not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants. Conversely, Rps7 mouse mutants show no anemia orhyperpigmentation, phenotypes associated with mutation of human RPS7 and other murine RPs, respectively. We providetwo novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants tofurther explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes.Citation: Watkins-Chow DE, Cooke J, Pidsley R, Edwards A, Slotkin R, et al.

Ribosomesthemselves, which consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits,are assembled from about 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs)along with four species of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus [1,2].RPs fall broadly into two categories; the RPL proteins that makeup the large ribosomal subunit, and the RPS proteins thatconstitute the small subunit. Mutations in both RPL and RPSgenes have been implicated in a set of shared phenotypiccharacteristics in invertebrates. This is best illustrated by theapproximately 50 Drosophila melanogaster Minute mutants, a collec-tion of ribosomal gene mutations that are characterized bydevelopmental delay, short thin bristles, growth retardation,reduced fertility and recessive lethality [3].In vertebrates, a phenotypic overlap among RP mutants occurssimilar to that seen in Drosophila Minute mutants, howeveradditional phenotypic complexity is emerging, in which mutationor suppression of RPs results in some phenotypes that dependupon which gene is mutated. This is highlighted by a recent studyin which 20 different RP genes were targeted using morpholinoantisense oligos in the zebrafish Danio rerio [4]. Whereas somephenotypes were shared among knockdowns, such as hypoplasia ofthe yolk sac, others were gene-specific. For instance, knockdown ofrps15 resulted in an enlarged 4thventricle of the brain, whereasPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094knockdown of rpl35a caused a sharply bent tail, and targeting ofrps29 produced an enlarged lens [4]. A similar picture ofphenotypic overlap paired with gene-specific phenotypes isemerging in mice. For example, mutations in Rps19 and Rps20result in increased epithelial pigmentation, a ventral belly spot,small body size, and a reduction in red blood cell count [5]. Micewith mutations in Rpl24 also have ventral belly spots and body sizereduction, but they present with additional retinal abnormalitiesand skeletal defects [6]. Mice harboring the Rpl27a sooty foot alleleshare an epidermal hyperpigmentation phenotype with Rps19 andRps20 mutants, but display the additional feature of cerebellarataxia [7]. These distinct features of individual RP mutantphenotypes suggest that vertebrate RPs may have unique, tissue-specific functions and/or tissue-specific expression levels. Indeed,the broad spectrum of distinct phenotypes that have beencharacterized in a relatively small number of mammalian RPmutants also hints at possible extra-ribosomal functions of RPs.In humans, mutations in RPs have been implicated inhematopoetic disorders, most notably Diamond-Blackfan anemia(DBA), which has been attributed to mutations in RPS19, RPS26,RPS24, RPS17, RPS10, RPS7, RPL35a, RPL26, RPL11, and RPL5[8\u201314]. While anemia is a shared phenotype among all patientscarrying these various gene mutations, some specific attributes areassociated with individual genes. For example, mutations in RPL5are associated with cleft palate and anomalies of the thumb andheart, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominant inpatients carrying mutations in RPL11 [11].In this paper, we further examine the role of ribosomes inmammalian development by investigating Rps7. Through analysisof two new ENU-induced mouse mutants of Rps7, montu (Mtu)and zuma (Zma), we show that mutation of Rps7 impairs ribosomalbiogenesis, resulting in variable lethality and reduced body sizeaccompanied by abnormal skeletal, melanocyte, eye, and centralnervous system (CNS) development. While many of thesephenotypes have previously been associated with mutation ofmurine RP genes, the findings of overt brain malformations andbehavioral abnormalities are novel. Similar to mutation of otherRP genes in the mouse, the penetrance of the Rps7-associatedphenotypes is affected by genetic background and the overtphenotypes are suppressed by TRP53 deficiency. These mutantsprovide the first mouse models of Rps7 disruption and increase ourunderstanding of the phenotypic consequences of mammalian RPmutations.ResultsIdentification and genetic mapping of montu and zumaThe montu (Mtu) mouse was identified in a large-scale ENUmutagenesis program [15,16] exhibiting dominant inheritance of aventral belly spot, kinked tail, and reduced body weight (Figure 1A,1B). Linkage analysis was performed using a cross of the Mtufounder (BALB/c OlaHsd background) with C3H/HeH. Analysisof genotypes of 104 offspring demonstrated linkage to a 74 Mbregion of proximal chromosome 12 that was further refined to a3.43 Mb critical region (Figure S1A, S1C). DNA sequencing ofexons and flanking regions of 17 candidate genes using genomicDNA from four affected animals and controls identified a singleheterozygous sequence variant occurring only in affected micewithin exon 6 of Rps7, which encodes a 194 amino acid ribosomalprotein, RPS7 (or S7e, the eukaryotic specific homolog of the yeastS7A and S7B). The identified Rps7 variant, c.574T.G(NM_011300), encodes a Gly substitution of a highly conservedVal residue (p.V156G; NP_035430) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A).Subsequent sequence analysis of 91 animals from a C3H/HeHcongenic Mtu colony showed 100% concordance between thec.574T.G mutation and the affected phenotypes. Analysis of Mtuanimals demonstrated variable penetrance on a mixed back-ground, however 100% penetrance of the tail kink, belly spot, andsmall body size phenotypes when assessed in the C3H/HeHcongenic colony. We also observed a dominant lethality phenotypewith incomplete penetrance, 72% viability in F1 BALB/c:C3Hmice (N = 251) and 26% viability in the C3H/HeH congeniccolony (N = 260).The zuma (Zma) mouse was independently identified as part of asensitized ENU screen designed to identify mutations thatincreased the severity of neural crest defects observed in Sox10haploinsufficient mice (Sox10LacZ/+), a well characterized neuralcrest mutant which presents with a high frequency of small, whitebelly spots [17]. Affected backcross mice (BALB/cJ6C57BL/6J)from the Zma pedigree exhibited large white belly spots, tail kinks,and reduced body size. Linkage analysis of twelve affected N1mice initially detected linkage of Zma to a region of chromosome12 overlapping where the Mtu mutation was localized (Figure S1B,S1C). Subsequent sequencing of Rps7 in Zma mice revealed aheterozygous A to C point mutation in exon 7 of Rps7, predictedto cause substitution of a conserved amino acid (p.Y177S;c.637A.C) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A). Genotyping analysis ofZma mice outcrossed to C57BL/6J to establish a congenic colonyshowed that the c.637A.C mutation was observed in 100% ofaffected mice. We initially observed incompletely penetrantphenotypes in N2 heterozygous Zma mice on a mixed BALB/cJ;C57Bl/6J background, where Zma/+ mice showed 74% viability,76% belly spots, and 90% tail kinks (N = 46). However,heterozygosity for the Zma allele rapidly changed to a completelypenetrant, lethal phenotype during outcrossing onto C57BL/6J,and no Zma/+ mice were observed at N4. This contrasted with thephenotype we observed during establishment of a congenic C3H/HeJ Zma colony; on this genetic background, the N3 generationexhibited a low frequency of belly spotting and tail kinks (4% and0%, respectively; N = 41) yet no lethality, as Zma heterozygotesAuthor SummaryRibosomes are composed of two subunits that eachconsist of a large number of proteins, and their function oftranslating mRNA into protein is essential for cell viability.Naturally occurring or genetically engineered mutationswithin an individual ribosomal protein provide a valuableresource, since the resulting abnormal phenotypes revealthe function of each ribosomal protein. A number ofmutations recently identified in mammalian ribosomalsubunit genes have confirmed that homozygous loss offunction consistently results in lethality; however, haploin-sufficiency causes a variety of tissue-specific phenotypes.In this paper, we describe the first mutant alleles of thegene encoding ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) in mouse. Rps7haploinsufficiency causes decreased size, abnormal skele-tal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eyemalformations, phenotypes that also occur with haploin-sufficiency for other ribosomal subunits. Additionally,significant apoptosis occurs within the developing centralnervous system (CNS) along with subtle behavioralphenotypes, suggesting RPS7 is required for CNS devel-opment. Mutation of human RPS7 has been implicated inDiamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), yet the murine alleles donot present an analogous phenotype. The phenotypes weobserve in the Rps7 mouse mutants indicate RPS7 shouldbe considered as a candidate for a broader spectrum ofhuman diseases.Rps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094were observed at the expected frequency through N6. Thecomparably mild phenotype we observed in the congenic C3H/HeJ Zma colony suggests that the Mtu allele may exert more severephenotypic effects than the Zma allele. This hypothesis issupported by the observations that Mtu/+ mice presented withreduced viability, fully penetrant belly spots, tail kinks, and smallbody size on a predominantly C3H/He genetic background, whileZma/+ mice on a similar background were observed at theexpected frequency and were generally indistinguishable inphenotype from their+/+littermates.Sequencing of exons 6 and 7 of Rps7 in 9 inbred strains (A/J,AKR/J, BALB/c, C57BL6/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA, DBA, LP/J, and101) confirmed that the point mutations detected in Mtu and Zmaare not natural variants. Additionally, we confirmed the presence ofthe mutations in Rps7 transcripts using Mtu/+ and Zma/+ cDNA forsequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. We also demonstrateda lack of complementation between the Mtu and Zma Rps7 alleles byperforming an intercross of heterozygous mice from the two lines.Genotyping of newborn offspring revealed that no animals carriedboth the Mtu and Zma mutations (N = 27) (Figure S1D). The lack ofviable double heterozygotes was consistent with homozygotelethality observed in each line, thus showing non-complementationof the two alleles. Collectively, the similar phenotypes, sequencingdata, and genetic analyses provide strong evidence that themutations identified in Rps7 are responsible for the observed Mtuand Zma phenotypes, hereafter referred to as Rps7Mtuand Rps7Zma.Figure 1. Heterozygous mutation of Rps7 results in visible white spotting, small body size, and tail kinking. (A) Montu (Mtu)heterozygous mice exhibiting a white belly spot and kinked tail were identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen. An independent ENU screen identifiedzuma (Zma) mice with similar phenotypes (data not shown). (B) Heterozygote Mtu/+ male (blue) and female (green) mice have a significantly reducedbody weight compared to wild-type male (gray) and female (red) littermates. (C) Sequencing revealed novel Rps7 point mutations in Mtu/+(c.574T.G, encoding p.V156G) and Zma/+ (c.637A.C, encoding p.Y177S) mice. Sequence traces shown are for the antisense strand.

The consequences of the RPS7Mtuand RPS7Zmamutant proteins were first assessed using thecomputational analyses PANTHER and SIFT. Results from thePANTHER coding SNP analysis tool [18] suggested that bothmutations are likely to be deleterious (PANTHER subPSEC scoreof 25.00 and 25.06 for RPS7Mtuand RPS7Zma, respectively).Similarly, the Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) algorithm[19] predicted both alleles to affect protein function, however, thehigh degree of conservation in the 72 database sequences at eachposition resulted in a low confidence level for the prediction (SIFTprediction score 0.00, median conservation 3.59 for both RPS7Mtuand RPS7Zma). Collectively, the computational analysis wasconsistent with the Rps7Mtuand Rps7Zmaalleles both havingfunctional consequences.The potential effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on RPS7secondary structure (Figure 1D, Figure S2) were also examined.There is no three-dimensional protein structure currently availablefor metazoan RPS7, therefore we used the available structuresfrom Tetrahymena thermophila (PDB ID 2XZM) and Saccharomycescerevisiae (PDB ID 3U5C), whose RPS7 ortholog sequences share37% and 55% residue identity with mouse RPS7, respectively[20,21]. RPS7 structural elements appear to be highly conservedacross species: the S. cerevisiae and T. thermophila proteins themselvesshare only 34% amino acid identity, yet their solved three-dimensional structures superimpose well, and are consistent withsecondary structural predictions of mouse RPS7 generated usingPSSpred (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred) andPROFsec [22] (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae and T.thermophila sequences each contain a Tyr residue homologous tomouse p.Y177 (Figure S2A), and a Val residue homologous tomouse p.V156 is present in S. cerevisiae and substituted conserva-tively with Ile in T. thermophila. The introduction of either p.V156Gor p.Y177S into the mouse sequence did not alter predictions ofthe beta strand and alpha helix at the respective locations of thesubstitutions (Figure S2B), suggesting that grossly altered second-ary structure may not be responsible for the functionalconsequences of RPS7Mtuor RPS7Zma.We next used biochemical analyses to examine the effects ofp.V156G and p.Y177S on stability and subcellular localization ofthe 22 kiloDalton (kDa) protein as well as ribosome assembly andbiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that nonsense mutationsin RPS19 can result in decreased protein levels, and missensemutations can alter the capacity of RPS19 to localize to thenucleolus [23]. C- and N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type,RPS7Mtuand RPS7Zmaproteins were transiently expressed inhuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Western blot analysisrevealed no differences in protein levels for any of the RPS7mutant proteins (Figure 2A, Figure S3A). The remaining in vitrostudies were focused on the potentially more severe RPS7Mtumutant protein. Analysis of the FLAG-tagged proteins revealed nonotable differences in subcellular localization of the RPS7Mtuprotein (Figure 2B). To verify the capacity of RPS7Mtuto beincorporated into the ribosome, cytoplasmic extracts fromtransiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated toseparate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (in the pellet) fromfree cytoplasmic proteins (in the supernatant). A similar fraction ofall transfected RPS7 proteins was observed in the ribosomal pellet(Figure S3B) indicating that the mutation does not alter RPS7assembly into the ribosome. To confirm this finding, cytoplasmicextracts from Rps7Mtu/+ liver were analyzed by ultracentrifugationthrough sucrose gradients, and the ratio between the peaks of theribosomal subunits in the absorbance profile was determined. Thisratio can reveal defects in the synthesis of one of the two subunits,such as the net increase of the 60S/40S ratio seen in culturedhuman cells following depletion of single RPs [24,25]. However,the observed 60S/40S ratio in Rps7Mtu/+ liver was similar tocontrol (Figure S3C), indicating that RPS7Mtudoes not drasticallyalter assembly of the ribosomal subunits.We further assessed whether RPS7Mtuaffects ribosomalbiogenesis by analyzing the pre-rRNA maturation pattern.Alterations are visualized by the accumulation of specific rRNAprecursors: a defect in large subunit RPs affects cleavage of 28Sprecursors, whereas a defect in small subunit RPs alters that of 18Sprecursors. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from wild-typeand Rps7Mtu/+ tissue, using a probe for the internal transcribedspacer (ITS) 1 of pre-rRNA that anneals to 18S rRNA precursors[26,27], indicated that 18S rRNA pre-rRNA processing wasaltered both in liver and brain from Rps7Mtu/+ mutant mice(Figure 2C). Quantitative measurement of the hybridizationsignals showed a significant accumulation of the 30S precursorin Rps7Mtu/+ (indicated by an increased 30S/21S ratio; Figure 2D),confirming altered rRNA precursor processing and demonstratingthat the RPS7Mtumutation has functional consequences onribosomal biogenesis.Characterization of the Rps7 phenotypeSkeletal and eye malformation. X-ray examination ofadult Rps7Zma/+ mice showed that vertebral fusion is responsiblefor the tail kinks (Figure 3A, 3B). Similar results were observed forRps7Mtu/+ adult mice, indicating that in both mutants, defectivesomitogenesis occurs as a result of RPS7 alterations. Decreasedvertebrae numbers were also observed in both mutants; areduction in total vertebrae number in Rps7Mtu/+ (52\u201355 versus55\u201357 in wild-type) and in caudal vertebrae number in Rps7Zma/+(16\u201319 versus 20\u201322 in wild-type). The decreased vertebraenumbers indicate defective tail bud function associated withdefects in RPS7. Alcian blue and alizarin red staining of lategestation Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ embryos (N = 3 for eachgenotype) revealed further Rps7Zma/+-associated skeletal abnor-malities, including general disorganization of vertebral processesand arches in the cervical vertebrae (Figure 3C, 3D). The anteriortuberculum was appropriately located on C6, however a verysmall partial rib was observed on C7 (in 2 Rps7Zma/+ embryos),indicating an incompletely penetrant transformation of C7 to T1.Within the thoracic region, we observed a shortened firststernebrae and asymmetric attachment of 8 ribs to the sternumrather than the usual 7 (in all 3 Rps7Zma/+ embryos) (Figure 3E,3F). Within the lumbar and sacral regions, a severe developmentaldelay was observed, and disorganization of the ossification centerswas evident with some ossification centers being duplicated(Figure 3G, 3H). Additionally, we observed a transformation ofL1 to T13 (in all 3 Rps7Zma/+ embryos) and also asymmetric fusionof the transverse processes of the first 5\u20136 sacral vertebrae (in 2Rps7Zma/+ embryos) rather than the 3\u20134 observed in Rps7+/+(Figure 3H). Collectively the skeletal phenotypes observed in Rps7mutants are consistent with an anterior transformation of the axialskeleton.Frequent microphthalmia and uveal coloboma were alsoobserved as features of the Rps7 mutant phenotype (Figure 4).Rps7Zma/+ embryos showed eye malformations ranging fromminor delay in optic fissure closure to severe microphthalmia andinternalization of the entire eye structure. Whole mount micro-scopic imaging of E12.5 embryos revealed that 100% of Rps7Zma/+embryos exhibited a unilateral or bilateral delay in closure of theoptic fissure, as compared to Rps7+/+ embryos which all showedRps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094normal optic fissures (N = 5 Rps7Zma/+, N = 7 Rps7+/+)(Figure 4A\u20134C). By E14.5, a time when wild-type embryos havecomplete fissure, 100% of Rps7Zma/+ embryos still displayed opticfissure closure defects either unilaterally (N = 2) or bilaterally(N = 3) (Figure 4D\u20134F). Additionally, more severe microphthal-mia and internalization of the eye was observed in 20% ofRps7Zma/+ embryos (Figure 4F, 4I; 1 out of 5 at both E12.5 andE14.5).Circulating blood chemistry and erythroiddifferentiation. Because human RPS7 mutations are associatedwith DBA [11], a disease characterized by red cell aplasia, weundertook an initial characterization of circulating blood in adultRps7Mtu/+ mice (on a C3H/He background) and Rps7Zma/+ mice(on a mixed C57BL/6J; BALB/cJ background). Neither Rps7mutant allele caused any significant differences from Rps7+/+littermates in total hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) counts, whiteblood cell (WBC) counts, or hematocrit (Figure 5A, 5B, Table S1).Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly elevated in Rps7Mtu/+ mice (elevated 1.026 fold over wild-type, p,0.05) (Figure 5A),however no significant difference in MCV was observed inRps7Zma/+ mice (Figure 5B). Additional analyses of plasmabiochemistry revealed no significant differences betweenRps7Mtu/+ and Rps7+/+ animals in major electrolytes andmetabolic indicators (Na+, K+, Cl2, urea, creatinine, ALP, AST,ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, amylase, and free fattyacids) (Table S2).To further assess erythroid development of Rps7Zma/+ mice,which exhibit perinatal lethality on a C57BL/6J background,E13.5 Rps7Zma/+ fetal liver samples were characterized by flowcytometry. We simultaneously used monoclonal antibodies againstthe erythroid cell lineage markers CD71, expressed at higher levelsduring early stages of erythroid differentiation, and Ter119,expressed at higher levels as erythrocytes mature, to profile 5characteristic populations of erythroid precursors (R1 to R5)[28,29] (Figure 5C). These cell populations correspond toincreasingly differentiated developmental stages, with R1 markingerythroid progenitors and proerythroblasts, R2 marking proeryth-roblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts, R3 marking allbasophilic erythroblasts, R4 marking chromatophilic and ortho-chromatophilic erythroblasts, and R5 marking late orthochroma-tophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Compared to their Rps7+/+ littermates, Rps7Zma/+ E13.5 embryos showed a significantincrease in the percentage of R3 cells (p,0.001) suggesting thaterythroid precursors could be blocked in their maturation(Figure 5D). However, analysis of erythroid cell populations ofE14.5 fetal livers showed that the percentages of cells in the R2\u2013R5 populations were indistinguishable between Rps7+/+ andRps7Zma/+ genotypes (Table S3). The presence of the more matureR4 and R5 cells at E14.5 indicates erythroid differentiationprogresses, rather than being blocked at R3. Alternatively, theincrease in R3 cells at E13.5 may result from a generaldevelopmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ embryos. This was confirmedby inspection of gross anatomical features of crown-rump length,along with eye, limb, and craniofacial development at E11.5\u201313.5,which showed that Rps7Zma/+ embryonic development is delayedby approximately one day relative to that of Rps7+/+ littermates(Figure S4). While we cannot rule out subtle alterations inerythroid maturation that may cause the differences observed inthe precursor populations, these analyses collectively suggest thatthese two mutant alleles of Rps7 do not significantly impair redblood cell production or differentiation.Early effect on melanoblast development. To assess theeffects of RPS7 mutation on melanocyte development, wecharacterized Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos from E10.5 to 14.5.Figure 2. Rps7Mtu shows reduced function in ribosomalprecursor processing.

The average of the values is reported in the bar graphs withS.E.M.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003094.g002Rps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 5 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094To mark developing melanoblasts, we generated transgenicRps7Zma/+ embryos carrying the melanoblast reporter Tg(Dct-LacZ) [30]. In these Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos, Dct-positivemelanoblasts were notably reduced by E10.5 relative to Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6A, 6B). At E14.5, a significantreduction in melanoblast number was still observed in both thehead and trunk of Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice compared toRps7+/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6C\u20136F). Mutation ofRps7 did not cause a complete loss of melanoblasts, however, asDct-positive cells could still be observed at E14.5 in regions wheremelanoblast density is normally highest, particularly around thedeveloping pinna and eye (Figure 6C, 6D). This severe melano-blast reduction in Rps7Zma/+ embryos was independently con-firmed by in situ hybridization with a probe targeting mRNA forthe melanoblast/melanosome-specific protein Pmel17 (Figure S5).Qualitative observation of Pmel17-expressing melanoblasts showedthat E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos displayed a markedreduction in melanoblasts relative to E12.5 Rps7+/+ littermates.The reduction in melanoblasts is more severe than can beattributed to the developmental delay observed in Rps7Zma/+mutants, as E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ embryos showed a reducedmelanoblast number even in comparison to E11.5 Rps7+/+embryos (Figure S5). A combination of Rps7 and Sox10haploinsufficiency (Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)further reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (Figure S6),consistent with the increased spotting observed in rare Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ pups that survived postnatally (Figure S7A, S7B).Postnatally, we observed that melanocytes were present in thetail skin of Rps7Zma/+ mice (Figure S7E, S7F), yet no dark skinphenotype occurred in the tails or footpads of adult Rps7Zma/+ orRps7Mtu/+mice (Figure S7C\u2013S7F). This indicates that these Rps7mutations do not cause epidermal melanocytosis, as was previouslyobserved for mutation of Rps19 and Rps20 [5]. Collectively, thesedata show that mutation of Rps7 causes a severe, early reduction inmelanoblasts that is sufficient to account for the white bellyspotting observed in viable heterozygotes.Enlarged ventricles, cortical thinning, and deficits inworking memory. We examined the neuroanatomical featuresof the Rps7 mutants, employing histological techniques andmagnetic resonance microscopy (MRM). Gross observations andhistological staining revealed marked cortical thinning accompa-nied by enlarged ventricles in adult Rps7Mtu/+ (Figure 7A\u20137B) andperinatal Rps7Zma/+ mice (Figure 7C, and data not shown). Toinvestigate this phenotype further, we undertook MRM imaging ofRps7Zma/+ mice at E18.5 (N = 3) (Figure 7D\u20137I). Followingmanual segmentation of 10 major anatomic structures, the volumeof each brain region was calculated as a percentage of the totalbrain volume (Figure 7J) and 3-dimensional (3D) rendering withsmoothing was performed to generate 3D representations (VideoS1 and Video S2). This quantitative analysis showed that theRps7Zma/+ CNS phenotypes originate during development andconfirmed a significant reduction in cortical (P = 0.0002) andhippocampal (P = 0.0044) size in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. Althoughlateral ventricle volume was not significantly different betweenthese small groups, qualitative observations of ventricle size atdissection, in MRM images, and in histological sections consis-tently indicated Rps7Zma/+ mutants had enlarged ventricles,leading us to conclude that enlarged ventricles are a consistentfeature of the Rps7 phenotype.We investigated whether these gross neuroanatomical pheno-types affected the behavior of the Rps7Mtu/+ mice, assessinglocomotor activity, anxiety and working memory. The resultsshowed that while Rps7Mtu/+ mutants exhibited normal locomotoractivity and anxiety-related phenotypes, they displayed deficits inFigure 3. Skeletal abnormalities in Rps7 mutants.

Rps7Mtu/+ mutants displayed similar behavior toRps7+/+ controls in an open-field test, with no significantdifferences in total distance travelled in the open field or timespent in the center (Figure S8A). Similarly, there were nosignificant differences between Rps7+/+ controls and Rps7Mtu/+littermates when assessed on the elevated plus-maze (Figure S8B\u2013S8E), nor did Rps7Mtu/+ mutant animals display any ataxia thatwould be indicative of motor dysfunction. We also investigatedwhether Rps7Mtu/+ mice displayed any defects in working memoryusing a spontaneous alternation test, which can indicate hippo-campal dysfunction [31]. The mouse is placed in the start arm ofan enclosed T-maze (the base of the \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019), and allowed to enter agoal arm (the two arms of the top of the \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019) of its own choice.Upon repeating this test, the mouse can demonstrate memory ofits previous choice by entering the arm not visited before, abehavior called spontaneous alternation. Here we observed asignificant difference between Rps7+/+ controls, which exhibitedan average alternation frequency of 83%, and Rps7Mtu/+ mutants,which exhibited an average alternation frequency of only 68%(N = 9, P = 0.01) (Figure 7K). Collectively, the MRM andbehavioral data indicate that Rps7 is required for normaldevelopment of the central nervous system, particularly thetelencephalon, and that mutations in this gene have the capacityto affect hippocampal-dependent behavior.Increased neuronal apoptosis in Rps7 mutants. Ourhistological studies also revealed that late gestation Rps7Zma/+embryos exhibited pyknotic nuclei in the white matter tracts of thespinal cord (Figure S9), consistent with CNS degeneration. Asmutations in other RPs have been associated with increasedcellular apoptosis [32\u201337], we used immunohistochemistry todetect cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) within the CNS. When comparedto normal littermates, Rps7Zma/+ embryos showed increasedapoptosis in the cortex and neural tube at both E11.5(Figure 8A, 8B, 8D, 8E) and E12.5 (data not shown). Althoughmitotic, phospho-histone H3-positive (PH3+) cells surrounding thelumen of the neural tube appeared slightly disorganized in E11.5and E12.5 Rps7Zma/+embryos (Figure 8G, 8H and data notshown), cell counting revealed no significant difference in PH3+cell number per section compared to Rps7+/+ littermates(Figure 8J). In contrast, CC3 counts confirmed a significantincrease in apoptosis in the neural tube of E11.5 Rps7Zma/+embryos compared to Rps7+/+ (N = 3, p,0.001) (Figure 8K).Consistent with the location of apoptosis and with a putative rolefor RPS7 in CNS development, in situ hybridization studies onFigure 4.

In addition, H&E stained sagittal sections through the eye are shown for one Rps7+/+ and two differentRps7Zma/+ embryos at E18.5 (G\u2013I).

Using immunohistochemistry, we observed anincrease in TRP53 staining in the cortex (E11.5) and neural tube(E11.5 and E12.5) of Rps7 mutants consistent with increasedTRP53-mediated apoptosis (Figure S11). Collectively, the histol-ogy and immunohistochemistry data confirm that massive celldeath in the Rps7 mutant CNS occurs at the onset of neurogenesis.Phenotypic suppression of Rps7 mutant phenotypesbyTrp53 haploinsufficiency. In an attempt to restore hetero-zygote viability by suppressing apoptosis, we crossed the Rps7Zmamutation onto a Trp53 mutant background. Trp53 mutations havebeen used to successfully suppress phenotypes in other RP mutants[5,35]. Rps7Zmamice were originally identified on a mixed geneticbackground, and heterozygote lethality in Rps7Zma/+ miceincreased as the mutation was outcrossed onto a C57BL/6Jbackground. Thus we used early generation, mixed backgroundRps7Zma/+ mice to establish a cross with Trp53 mutant mice on aC57Bl/6J background (B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J, hereafterTrp53KO). Within a few generations of outcrossing, no viableRps7Zma/+ mice were observed after birth, as expected. However,Rps7Zma/+; Trp53 KO/+ double heterozygotes were recovered atthe expected 50% frequency, suggesting restoration of Rps7Zma/+viability in the context of Trp53 haploinsufficiency (Table S4). InFigure 5. Peripheral-blood parameters appear normal with slight developmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ fetal liver red cell precursors.(A) Rps7Mtu/+ mice displayed similar complete blood count (CBC) values to their wild-type littermates with the exception of a very slightly elevatedmean corpuscular volume (MCV) (* indicates p,0.05; N = 7).

In most cases Rps7Zma/+;Trp53KO/+ double heterozygotes were indistinguishable from theirwild-type littermates after weaning, with the exception of a verysmall belly spot observed in 47% of Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ mice.Trp53 haploinsufficiency also suppressed the phenotypes of grossembryonic developmental delay (Figure S4), the subtle delay inerythroid maturation (Table S3), and CNS apoptosis (Figure 8C, 8F,8K). In summary, the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in Rps7Zma/+mice all appeared to be suppressed by Trp53 haploinsufficiency.DiscussionIn this paper we present genetic, functional, and phenotypicevidence that the montu (Mtu) and zuma (Zma) mouse lines isolatedfrom independent ENU screens harbor distinct point mutations inRps7. These first-reported alleles of Rps7 in mice cause similarphenotypes including small body size, tail abnormalities, mid-ventral white spotting, eye defects, and an underdevelopedcerebral cortex.We provide functional evidence that the Rps7Mtumutation(p.V156G) affects ribosome biogenesis. The altered Rps7Mtu30S/21S ratio is consistent with the altered pre-rRNA maturationreported for a DBA patient harboring an RPS7 donor splice-sitemutation (c.147+1G.A) that results in accumulation of 30S and45S precursors [11]. A requirement for RPS7 during rRNAmaturation is supported by other studies showing a role for humanRPS7 in early stages of 45S rRNA processing [24] or the nuclearstages of 40S maturation [38]. In yeast, depletion of the two RPS7paralogs (S7a and S7b) results in a severe growth defect [39,40]and S7 has been hypothesized to play an early role as a componentof the small subunit processome [41] as well as a later role inribosome biogenesis during assembly of polysomes [42]. However,the mechanism underlying the altered rRNA maturation in thesemurine Rps7 mutants is not clear, as neither the Rps7Mtunor theRps7Zmamutation is predicted to grossly disrupt protein secondarystructure, and RPS7Mtuprotein is correctly localized andincorporated into ribosomes in cultured cells. Presumably, themutant RPS7 proteins could be altered in their interactions withrRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or non-ribosomal proteins. Thepossibility of interaction with non-ribosomal proteins is intriguinggiven the position of RPS7 at the surface of the ribosome (FigureS2C, S2D) in close proximity to the binding site for eIF4G [21], aeukaryotic initiation factor important for assembling the pre-initiation complex. Interestingly, most other known, viable mouseRP mutations also occur in eukaryotic-specific RPs located at thesurface of the ribosome. Additional work is needed to determinethe precise role RPS7 plays in mammalian ribosome biogenesisand how the Rps7Mtuand Rps7Zmamutations disrupt this function.While modeling the pre-rRNA processing defect of an RPS7DBA patient, these Rps7 mutant mice do not replicate thecharacteristic DBA phenotype of severe anemia. This lack of ananemia phenotype is not entirely unexpected, since the analysis ofmany mouse mutants suggests that mice as a species are generallyless sensitive than humans to any gene haploinsufficiency [43,44].This is exemplified by the fact that, despite frequent mutation ofFigure 6. Melanoblast numbers are reduced in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. (A, B) In transgenic embryos carrying the melanoblast reporter Tg(Dct-LacZ), whole mount staining showed that Dct-positive melanoblasts are significantly reduced at E10.5 in Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice (A) comparedto Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (B). The reduction is noticeably apparent over the otic region (red circle). (C,D) Whole mount staining of E14.5Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos showed that these embryos (D) also display a reduction in melanoblasts relative to Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates(C). The microphthalmia observed in Rps7Zma/+ mice is apparent in (D). (E, F) Consistent with the whole-mount observations, transverse vibratomesections through the trunk of E14.5 embryos revealed very few melanoblasts in the developing skin of Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice (F) as comparedto the numerous melanoblasts seen in Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (arrow, E). Blue punctate staining indicates positive signal in melanoblasts. Inall pairs of images, Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ are at the same magnification.

It is possible that further studies of Rps7 alleles on differentgenetic backgrounds or in mice with more severe alleles mayreveal additional red blood cell phenotypes. In the future,comparison among mouse DBA models may provide insight intowhy the murine and human hematological phenotypes do not fullyoverlap, and may also reveal why mutation in RPS19 has auniquely high frequency in DBA compared to other RPs thatcause the disease.Both Rps7 mutants display a variety of skeletal phenotypes thatcollectively suggest that normal ribosome biogenesis is required forthree distinct stages of somite development, which governssubsequent axial skeleton formation. First, the decreased numberof tail vertebrae indicates an insufficient production of somiteprogenitors. Second, the mutant vertebral fusion leading to tailkinks is indicative of incorrect somite border formation. Third, themutants exhibit an array of axial skeleton defects consistent withFigure 8. Increased apoptosis occurs in the developing CNS of Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos; however, this apoptosis is reduced inRps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ embryos.

Widespread disturbances of the skeletal systemencompassing each of these three defects are also found in Rpl38(tail short, Ts) [46,47] and Rpl24 (belly spot and tail, Bst) mutants[6,48]. Indeed, there are striking similarities in the defectsobserved in Rpl38 and Rps7 mutants, including specific transfor-mations within the cervical (C7 to T1), thoracic (T8 to T7), lumbar(L1 to T13) and sacral (fusion of additional transverse processes)regions. Mutations in Rpl38 and Rpl24 cause additional distur-bances of the appendicular skeleton not observed in Rps7,however, given the similarities of these mutants to Rps7 it will beinteresting to see if appendicular skeletal defects are observed withdifferent Rps7 alleles and/or genetic backgrounds. Interestingly,severe skeletal malformations have not been reported for five othermurine RP mutants (Rps19, Rps20, Rpl22, Rpl27a, Rpl29)[5,7,8,49,50]. This suggests that either mutation of RP proteinsdo not universally affect skeletal development, or skeletal defectsremain to be identified in these other RP mutants. In the case ofRps7, the severity of skeletal defects was modified by both geneticbackground and by allele, suggesting that detailed characterizationin existing and additional RP mutants is necessary to furtherexplore the role of RP proteins in skeletal development.We show that Rps7Zma-mediated white spotting results from asevere developmental reduction in melanoblasts. A developmentalreduction in melanoblasts has also been reported in Rps19 andRps20 heterozygous mutants, however, these mutants subsequentlydevelop epidermal melanocytosis [5], a phenotype not seen ineither Rps7 mutant. This difference is unlikely to be due to geneticbackground, as both Rps7 mutants and Rps19 and Rps20 mutantswere examined on a predominantly C3H background. Alterna-tively, the difference could be a more severe developmentalreduction in melanoblast numbers in Rps7 mutants, resulting infewer melanoblasts available at later time points to generateepidermal melanocytosis. Another possibility is that loss of Rps7may not have the same effect in keratinocytes as loss of Rps6, Rps19and Rps20, which are thought to act in keratinocytes to produceTRP53-mediated dark skin [5]. Our in vitro experiments with Rps7(Figure 2 and Figure S3) suggest that these mutations arehypomorphic alleles, so a third possibility is that allele severity,rather than gene-specific function, could account for pigmentationphenotype differences among RP mutants.The mouse Rps7 mutants display additional developmentaldefects of reduced cortical and hippocampal size. We hypothesizethat cell death within the developing CNS is sufficient to accountfor the neocortical thinning we observe in both Rps7 mutant lines.We also hypothesize that apoptosis within the developingtelencephalon might account for the deficit in working memoryobserved in Rps7Mtu/+ heterozygotes. To our knowledge, this is anovel developmental brain abnormality in mouse arising from RPhaploinsufficiency, differing substantially from the only otherreport of neuronal defects in RP mutant mice, that of cerebellarabnormalities and ataxia in Rpl27a sooty foot mutants [7].Interestingly, the neuronal phenotypes in mouse Rps7 mutantscorrelate with the report of microcephaly as one of 11 congenitalcraniofacial anomalies that can be associated with DBA [51], andare consistent with RP mutant phenotypes observed in differentmodel organisms. In zebrafish, gene-specific neuronal phenotypeswere seen in a subset of knocked-down RPs [4] and further studiesof RPL11 revealed brain deformities and reduced neuronalprogenitor cells along with apoptosis in the affected regions [32].In the zebra finch, RPL17 and RPL37 both regulate the sexuallydimorphic formation of the song control regions of the brainwithin the VZ [52]. Thus, the murine Rps7 mutant phenotypesadd to a growing body of literature linking individual RPs tospecific features of neural development and suggesting that otherRP mouse mutants may have previously uncharacterized defects inbrain development.Important questions remain regarding what underlying cellularmechanisms explain the similarities and differences among RP-associated phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests acommon mechanism where alterations in RP expression result inactivation of TRP53, suggesting ribosomal stress is one of themany cellular anomalies detected by TRP53. For example, in theirstudy of RP-mediated dark skin, McGowan and colleagues showthat TRP53 acts as a sensor of ribosomal integrity, and thatmutations in Rps19 and Rps20 can be phenotypically suppressed byTrp53 deficiency [5]. Trp53 haploinsufficiency also relieves theabnormal phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the sooty footataxia allele of Rpl27a [7] or the Bst allele of Rpl24 [6]. Similarly,our results show that loss of Rps7 increases TRP53 levels and thatTrp53 haploinsufficiency suppresses all morphological aspects ofthe Rps7 phenotype. Our in vivo studies are supported by recentstudies showing that Rps7 depletion in vitro as well as in vivo inzebrafish induces TRP53 expression [53,54], and collectivelysuggest the mechanism underlying the Rps7 phenotype is TRP53activation followed by TRP53-mediated apoptosis.While these data suggest that RP mutant phenotypes may all beattributed to alterations in RP\u2014TRP53 interactions, the variabil-ity among RP phenotypes suggests more complexity, potentially asa result of RP gene-specific or cell-specific functions [55]. Tissue-specific effects of mutations in different RPs have been observed inzebrafish [4], mouse [5,6] and human [11]. These apparentlytissue-specific phenotypes could simply be due to incompletephenotypic characterization, differing severity of hypomorphicalleles, and/or differing genetic backgrounds. However, if theytruly reflect tissue-specific RP functions, one explanation could bedifferences in the relative expression levels of individual RPs, witha consequent differential sensitivity to RP insufficiency that couldvary with tissue type, developmental stage or differentiation state.Indeed, remarkable heterogeneity in RP mRNA levels has beenobserved in a variety of tissues [56] including specifically duringmouse embryonic development [47] and human neuronaldifferentiation [57].A cell type-specific sensitivity to RP insufficiency is stronglysupported by the observation that keratinocyte-specific Rps6hemizygosity causes hyperpigmentation while melanocyte-specificRps6 hemizygosity instead causes hypopigmentation [5]. Similarly,the severe melanoblast reduction in Rps7 mutants could suggest amelanocyte-specific sensitivity to RPS7 loss. Given that Sox10 andRps7 pathways interact in melanocytes in vivo (Figure S6, FigureS7), it will be interesting to determine if a melanocyte-specifictranscriptional response to RPS7 deficiency is mediated by Sox10,which is expressed in melanocytes but absent in keratinocytes.TRP53 activation in melanocytes has already been associated withdownregulation of another white spotting gene, Kit, which isproposed as a transcriptional target of TRP53 [7,58]. Furtherwork is needed in melanocytes and other cell types that display RPgene-specific phenotypes, to clarify if direct transcriptionalregulation of lineage-specific genes plays a role in tissue-specificsensitivity to individual RP deficiencies.Another explanation of tissue-specific RP phenotypes could be afunction for individual RPs in the translation of specific mRNAs.This is supported by studies of RPL13 [59] and by a recent studyreporting patterning defects in Rpl38 mutant mouse embryos due toRPL38 translational regulation of a subset of Hox transcripts [47].The tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7 mutants would beconsistent with a role for RPS7 in facilitating translationalregulation of transcripts critical for development of the affectedRps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094tissues. Alternatively, tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7mutants could be a consequence of a direct interaction betweenRPS7 and tissue-specific developmental regulators at the proteinlevel. Interestingly, support for protein-protein interactions betweenRPS7 and SOX10 comes from recent evidence that RPS7 interactsdirectly with SRY, an HMG box protein related to SOX10 [60].This mechanism of direct interaction between RPs and tissue-specific, non-ribosomal proteins could explain tissue-specific phe-notypes in RP mutants, and is supported by a number of studiesreporting extra-ribosomal functions of specific RPs in regulation ofribosome biosynthesis and binding of transcription factor complexes(reviewed in ref. [55]).The relative contributions of these various mechanistic expla-nations for tissue-specific and gene-specific RP mutant phenotypeswill be clarified with further detailed comparison of mutants onconsistent genetic backgrounds and with additional informationfrom tissue-specific conditional alleles. In summary, these novelalleles of Rps7 add to the growing collection of mammalianribosomal mutants and provide two new mouse models of a DBA-associated gene. Importantly, the unique CNS apoptosis andbehavioral phenotypes reported here suggest that RPs need to beconsidered as candidate genes for not only DBA but also a broadspectrum of neurodevelopmental human diseases.Materials and MethodsEthics statementAll procedures performed in the UK were in accordance withthe UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and thoseperformed in the United States were approved by the IACUC inaccordance with NIH guidelines.MiceMontu mice were identified in a screen where BALB/c male micewere mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C3H/He forscreening. Zuma mice were identified in an ENU screen sensitizedby Sox10 haploinsufficiency (Sox10LacZ/+), where BALB/cJ micewere mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C57Bl/6J mice forfurther pedigree analysis. Trp53 null mice (B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J,stock #002101) were purchased from JAX Mice. For behavioralstudies, mice were housed in facilities with a 12:12 light:dark cycle ata temperature of 2261uC with a 60\u201370% humidity. Upon weaning,mice were separated into single-sex littermate groups and food wasavailable ad libitum.For body weight analysis, each gender/genotype grouprepresented in Figure 1B was weighed over 10 weeks (averageN = 9 for each Figure 1B data point, range N = 2\u201319). A Student\u2019st-test was used to compare wild-type to mutant within gender-matched groups at each age. Significance was assessed using theBonferonni method to correct for multiple testing, with p,0.001deemed significant. In females, all time points after 1 week weresignificantly different and in males all time points after 2 weekswere significantly different, with the exception of 8.5 weeks whereonly 2 mutant mice were weighed (p,0.003).Alizarin red and alcian blue staining of skeletons was conductedusing standard techniques. Briefly, embryos were skinned andeviscerated, fixed 24 hours in ethanol, then fixed 24 hours inacetone. Staining was performed for 3\u20134 hours at 37uC and then3\u20134 days at room temperature. After staining, embryos wererinsed in water and cleared in 1% KOH for 3 hours at roomtemperature and moved to fresh 1% KOH overnight. Afterclearing, embryos were serially transferred through 20%/1%KOH, 50% glycerol/1% KOH, and 80% glycerol/1% KOH.FACS analysis was completed using standard techniques.Briefly, fetal liver samples were collected in ice cold PBS anddispersed into a single cell suspension with passage through a 21gauge needle. Samples were incubated for 20 minutes with theaddition of 10 ml of each antibody (BD Parmingen Ter119-APCand CD71-FITC), then washed once with PBS before FACSanalysis. At each age ANOVA analysis was performed with a post-hoc test to compare selected pairs: (Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+) and(Rps7Zma/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+).Genetic mapping and sequencingDNA was extracted from mice using standard techniques. ForMtu, the mutation was mapped using 11 affected animals and 51polymorphic MIT makers that were amplified by PCR andvisualized on a 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.Fine mapping was performed with 13 additional SNPs thatdistinguished between BALB/c and 101. Seventeen known andpredicted genes were identified in the Mtu critical interval from theEnsembl database (ENSMUSG00000020633, ENSMUSG00000066544, ENSMUSG00000020636, ENSMUSG00000036655,ENSMUSG00000061477, ENSMUSG00000020630, ENSMU-SG00000020629, ENSMUSG00000020628, ENSMUSG00000036613, ENSMUSG00000061911, ENSMUSG00000020674,ENSMUSG00000020673, ENSMUSG00000020672, ENSMU-SG00000043061, ENSMUSG00000044573, ENSMUSG00000020669, ENSMUSG00000036136). All exons and adjacent splicesites for these 17 genes were sequenced using a BigDye dideoxy-terminator system and analyzed on an ABI3700 sequencer(Applied Biosystems). For Zma, DNA from 8 offspring wasanalyzed using the Illumina GoldenGate assay medium densitylinkage panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The addition of 24microsatellite markers, from 4 regions with suggestive linkage (Chr4, 6, 12, 17) in 8 additional affected mice, allowed localization tochromosome 12 (D12Mit182 -D12Mit60). Rps7 was sequenced asa candidate gene using the same methods as for Mtu.Cellular studies and Western blotsmRNA was extracted from wild-type and Rps7Mtu/+ brains, andcDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Ahigh fidelity PCR polymerase (KOD, Novagen) was thenemployed to amplify the Rps7 transcript encoding a fusion proteintagged at either the C- or N-terminus with a FLAG epitope, priorto cloning into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Constructs weretransfected into HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips, beforefixation and staining 48 hours later. The primary antibodyemployed was a rabbit anti-FLAG (Abcam, ab21536, 1:1000),followed by a fluorescent secondary (1:200, Molecular Probes).Five independent transfections were performed. Images werecaptured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.For Western blot experiments, DNA constructs encoding wild-type RPS7, RPS7 p.V156G, and RPS7 p.Y177S fused to theFLAG epitope at the N- or C-terminus were used in transienttransfection experiments in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293cells. Neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) expressed by thecloning vector pcDNA3.1 was used as a control for transfectionefficiency. After transfection, proteins were separated on a 12%SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose Protran membrane(Schleicher and Schuell) and incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAGor anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) antibody for 1 hr.Following three consecutive washes in PBS/Tween, the mem-brane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goatanti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using achemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and a LAS3000 ImageRps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094System (Fuji). Equal loading was checked by Ponceau-S redstaining of the membranes before Western blot analysis.Ribosomal analysisFor Northern blots for rRNA processing, RNA was extractedfrom mouse tissues with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol. Total RNA was fractionated on formal-dehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Gene Screen Plusmembrane (NEN). To detect rRNA precursor transcripts, ITS1probe was prepared by 59 end-labeling of a 28-mer oligonucleotide(GCTCCTCCACAGTCTCCCGTTAATGATC) with 25 mCi ofc [32P]-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standardprotocols. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42uC in 66SSPE, 1% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml ssDNA and 56Denhardt\u2019s solution.After hybridization, the blot was washed twice with 1% SDS in 26SSPE for 30 min at 37uC. Quantitation of signals was obtained byphosphor screen scanning with a STORM PhosphorImager andImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The exper-iments were performed on tissues from Rps7+/+ and Rps7Mtu/+littermate mice (2 Rps7+/+ and 2 Rps7Mtu/+ for liver, 3 Rps7+/+and 3 Rps7Mtu/+ for brain, each in triplicate). Quantitation isreported as the ratio between 30S and 21S rRNA precursors andwas significantly different between genotypes in both brain(p,0.01) and liver (p,0.01) (two-way ANOVA with post hoc t-test).For ribosome isolation, cytoplasmic extracts from RPS7p.V156G transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionatedthrough ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. After 2 hours ofcentrifugation at 100,000 g, ribosomes and ribosomal subunitswere recovered in the pellet and free cytoplasmic proteins wererecovered from the supernatant.For sucrose gradients separating polysomes and ribosomalsubunits, cytoplasmic extracts from Mtu/+ liver were loaded onto a10%\u201330% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. Gradients werecentrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 5 hr at 37,000 rpm andthen the absorbance profile of the gradient was used to evaluatethe ratio between the peaks of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S).In situ hybridizationFor whole mount, Pmel17-containing plasmid (Riken cDNAclone G370069C13; GenBank Acc: BB766987) was digested withKpn1 and transcribed with T3 polymerase to generate DIG-labeled in situ probes. Hybridizations were performed usingpublished protocols [61] with the following modifications. Afterprobe hybridization, Ribonuclease A digestion was omitted, andTris-buffered saline was used in place of PBS. BM-purple substrate(Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) was used in place of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium. Embryos werephotographed using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V12 microscopewith a Zeiss AxioCam camera. Probes to detect Rps7 by in situhybridization were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the following primer pairs:R7_IN_F AAGGAAATCGAAGTTGGTG and R7_IN_ RAATTAACATCCTTGCCTGTG. Mouse embryos were fixedin 2\u20134% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% (w/v)sucrose in phosphate buffer before sectioning (10\u201320 mm) on acryostat. In situ hybridization was carried out as previouslydescribed [62]. Briefly, hybridization of sections with35S-UTP-labeled RNA probes was carried out in a 50% (v/v) formamidesolution at 60uC. Sections were washed in 50% (v/v) formamide,an RNAse A treatment was performed for 30 min at 37uC, andthen successively stringent SSC solution washes were performed,with a final wash at 0.16 SSC at 60uC.Histology and immunohistochemistryFor Nissl staining, adult mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCland 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde before the brain was dehydratedin 30% sucrose, sectioned (40 mm) on a freezing microtome, andstained.. For embryonic histology, embryos were fixed in eitherBouin\u2019s fixative or 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washedextensively in PBS, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol beforesectioning (5\u20137 mm paraffin) and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)staining. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4%paraformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS, dehydrated in10% sucrose followed by 20% sucrose, then embedded in Neg-50(Thermo Scientific) for cryosectioning (14 mm). Antibodies includ-ed anti-TRP53 (Leica NCL-p53-CM5p, 1:200), anti-CC3 (CellSignaling #9661, 1:200), and anti-PH3 (Millipore #06-570,1:200) and resulting stains were imaged using a Zeiss Observer.D1microscope. For apoptosis and proliferation experiments, trans-verse cryo-sections collected at the level of the forelimb from 3embryos of each genotype, 6 sections per embryo, were countedfor CC3+ and PH3+ cells. InStat software (GraphPad Software,Inc.) was used for one-way ANOVA statistical analysis. Nosignificant difference among the three genotypes was observed inPH3+ cell counts (p = 0.902). CC3 counts were significantlydifferent among genotypes (p = 0.0005) and a Tukey-Kramermultiple comparison post test was used for pairwise comparisonamong all genotypes with the following results: Rps7+/+ versusRps7Zma/+ (p,0.001), Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+(P.0.05, no significant difference), Rps7Zma/+ versus Rps7Zma/+;Trp53KO/+ (p,0.01).Behavioral phenotypingBehavioral phenotyping was performed on mutant and unaf-fected sex-matched littermates between 8 and 12 weeks of age.Open-field tests were conducted for 5 minutes in a brightly lit,60 cm diameter, enclosed white arena (field), and monitored by anautomated tracking system to measure the total distance travelledand the amount of time spent in the center versus the border of thefield. The elevated plus maze test was conducted with an elevatedplatform consisting of two enclosed arms and two open arms. Anautomated tracking system was employed to measure the numberof entries into each arm and distance traveled in open and closedarms of the elevated plus maze over 5 minutes. Spontaneousalternation was performed in an enclosed T-maze built from grayplastic (arm dimensions 30 cm610 cm630 cm). Each mouseunderwent 10 trials with an inter-trial interval of at least20 minutes. For each trial the mouse was placed in the startarm facing the end wall and allowed to enter a goal arm of its ownchoice. The mouse was confined in the goal arm for 30 secondsand then put back in the start arm and allowed a free choice ofeither arm [31].MRM imagingLate gestation (E18.5) embryos were collected, fixed in 4%paraformaldehyde overnight, washed extensively in PBS, andstored in 70% ethanol. Prior to imaging, embryos were rehydratedin a solution of PBS and 0.5% (v/v) Magnevist (Bayer HealthcarePharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), a contrast agent. MRM wasperformed on specimens using a Bruker 14.1T MR imagingspectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) using a multi-echoRARE technique [63] with TR/TE = 200/6.9 ms, 8-echoes, and4 signal averages. The resulting 3D images were acquired in53 min with an acquisition resolution of 50 microns isotropic.Manual segmentation of the whole brain and 10 major anatomicalregions was performed using Amira visualization software (v5.2.2,Visage Imaging Inc., Andover MA, USA) with guidance from anRps7 Mouse MutantsPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094anatomical reference atlas [64]. The volume of these regions wasestimated and 3D rendering with smoothing was performed togenerate 3D representations. Student\u2019s t-tests were used tocompare volumes of each Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ brain region.Significance was assessed using the Bonferonni method to correctfor multiple testing, with p,0.005 deemed significant.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Montu and zuma map to mouse Chromosome 12 andcause a variety of phenotypes.

NPT2 expression is shown as a control to normalize fortransfection efficiency. (B) Cytoplasmic extracts from transientlytransfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated. A similar fraction ofall transfected RPS7 proteins is observed in the ribosomal pellet (P)compared to the supernatant (S). (C) Polysomal profiles of livercytoplasmic extracts. After ultracentrifugation, the Optical Densityat 260 nm was measured along the sucrose gradient. Ratiobetween 60S and 40S peaks in Rps7Mtu/+ is similar to control. Theslight variation in 80S peak relative height is not significant as it iswithin the variability observed between samples, independent ofgenotype.(TIF)Figure S4 Embryonic developmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ mice issuppressed by Trp53 deficiency. Chronologically age-matchedlittermate embryos illustrate that Rps7Zma/+ mice exhibit devel-opmental delay at E11.5 and E12.5 relative to Rps7+/+ littermates(left 4 panels). This Rps7Zma-associated developmental delay issuppressed by Trp53 deficiency in Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ (right 4panels). Images for each of the 4 genotypes are shown at the samemagnification within an age (row).(TIF)Figure S5 Pmel17 expression is reduced at E12.5 in Rps7 mutantembryos. Comparison of Pmel17 in situ hybridizations of E12.5Rps7Zma/+ embryos (middle 3 panels) with E12.5 Rps7+/+embryos (left 3 panels) showed that Rps7Zma/+ embryos exhibit asevere reduction in melanoblasts. Furthermore, melanoblastnumber in E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ embryos was reduced below that ofE11.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (right 3 panels), thus showing that themelanoblast reduction in Rps7Zma/+ embryos exceeds the grossdevelopmental delay observed in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. Thisreduction is especially evident from comparison of E12.5Rps7Zma/+ and E11.5 Rps7+/+ melanoblast populations in theotic area (arrows), in the trunk posterior to the forelimb (*), and inthe tail region (arrowheads). Scale bars = 1 mm.(TIF)Figure S6 Mutation of Rps7 and Sox10 act synergistically toreduce melanoblast number. Combined haploinsufficiency forRps7 and Sox10 (Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)greatly reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (middle 3 panels)as compared to E12.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+mice (left 3 panels).Furthermore, E12.5 Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice showed agreater reduction in melanoblast number in comparison withE11.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice, indicating that this reductionin melanoblasts exceeded the gross developmental delay observedin Rps7Zma/+ mutants. Reduction is especially evident inmelanoblast populations in the otic area (arrow), and in the tailregion posterior to the hindlimb (arrowhead and posterior).
