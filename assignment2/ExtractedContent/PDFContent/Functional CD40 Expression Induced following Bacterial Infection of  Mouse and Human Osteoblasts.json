However, the mechanisms necessary for the protective host response, or thoseresponsible for pathogen-induced bone loss, are not clear. Recent evidence demonstrates that bacteriallyinfected osteoblasts secrete chemokines and cytokines, suggesting that these cells may have an unappreciatedrole in supporting localized inflammation. In this study, mouse and human osteoblasts were investigated fortheir ability to express functional CD40 upon exposure to two important pathogens of bone, Staphylococcusaureus and Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin. Bacterial infection of cultured mouse or human osteoblastsresulted in increased CD40 mRNA and CD40 protein expression induced by either pathogen. Importantly,CD40 expression by osteoblasts was functional, as assessed by ligation of this molecule with recombinant,soluble CD154. CD40 activity was assessed by induction of interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in osteoblasts following ligation. Cocultures of activated CD4\ufffd T lymphocytes and osteo-blasts could interact via CD40 and CD154, since an antibody against CD40 could block macrophage inflam-matory protein-1\ufffd secretion. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrate that infected osteoblastscan upregulate expression of functional CD40 molecules which mediate cytokine secretion. This surprisingresult further supports the notion that bone-forming osteoblasts can directly interact with CD154-expressingcells (i.e., T lymphocytes) and can contribute to the host response during bone infection.Interactions between CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD154) havebeen implicated as being critical for the initiation of T-lym-phocyte-dependent humoral and cell-mediated immune re-sponses (44). In particular, much attention has been given tothe ability of CD154-expressing T lymphocytes to ligate CD40on B lymphocytes (8), macrophages (51, 52), and dendriticcells (10). Such interactions provide strong activation signalsfor these professional antigen-presenting cells and, in effect,allow T lymphocytes to significantly influence the activity ofCD40-positive cells. In the absence of such interactions, hu-moral (8) and cell-mediated (17, 44, 62) immune responses aresignificantly impaired.Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of cell typescan express functional CD40 molecules. Endothelial cells (40),smooth muscle cells (40), epithelial cells (61), and even somefibroblasts (21, 48, 67) have been shown to be CD40 positive,suggesting that this molecule has a more ubiquitous role incellular activation beyond that documented for professionalantigen-presenting cells. The ability of a diverse population ofcell types to express CD40 also raises the important possibilitythat CD154-expressing T lymphocytes might interact withCD40 on these cells, initiating cellular activation and focusingthe T-lymphocyte response to a particular site.During diseases of bone and joints, infiltrating T lympho-cytes and macrophages are observed (55, 58) and are thoughtto contribute to the protective immune response and also tothe destruction of host tissues (7, 34, 37). The infiltration ofantigen-presenting cells into sites of bone disease would seemimportant, since the cellular components of bone (i.e., oste-oclasts and osteoblasts) are not thought to provide efficientantigen presentation or costimulation for infiltrating T lym-phocytes. Osteoclasts are derived from myeloid precursors (47,56) and are, therefore, of a lineage that might function todirectly interact with T lymphocytes. Conversely, osteoblastsare derived from a mesenchymal bone marrow precursor (3)and have been described as a sophisticated fibroblast (18). Assuch, the potential of osteoblasts for interacting with T lym-phocytes to initiate an immune response against pathogens ofbone, such as Staphylococcus and Salmonella, would seem to belimited. If true, the inability to interact with T lymphocytesposes a significant problem for the protective host responseagainst bacterial pathogens during bone diseases, unless otherantigen-presenting cells are functional in bone. In addition totight associations with bone matrices (13, 15), it is likely thatbacteria can survive within osteoblasts (32). If osteoblasts can-not effectively interact with T lymphocytes, this limitationmight explain why bone infections are difficult to resolve andoften recur.Recent studies have suggested, however, that this view maynot be completely accurate. Following interaction with bacteriaor bacterial products, bone-forming osteoblasts have beenshown to possess a surprising ability to upregulate expressionof cytokines (6, 12, 33, 53, 59) and chemokines (5, 25), whichcould augment T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory re-sponses. This recent realization is somewhat surprising, since* Corresponding author.

This surprising result further supports the notionthat these bone-forming cells can directly interact with T lym-phocytes during bone infection.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation and culture of mouse osteoblasts. Two-day-old BALB/c or C57BL/6neonates were euthanized and calvaria were removed. Primary osteoblasts wereisolated from calvaria by sequential collagenase-protease digestion as previouslydescribed by our laboratory (4, 5). Using immunofluorimetric analysis, osteoblastcultures were considered to be \ufffd99% pure as determined by cells stainingpositive for type I collagen, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase.Normal human osteoblast cultures. Normal human osteoblast cultures (Clo-netics, San Diego, Calif.) were purchased and propagated as described by themanufacturer. Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5%CO2 with osteoblast growth medium (Clonetics) containing 10% fetal bovineserum, ascorbic acid, gentamicin, and amphotericin B. When approximately 80%confluent, cells were trypsinized (0.025% trypsin\u20130.01% EDTA), washed in me-dium, and seeded into 6-well or 24-well plates. These commercially available cellshave previously been characterized as being authentic osteoblasts (26).Exposure of cultured mouse and human osteoblasts to bacteria, LPS, orpeptidoglycan. S. aureus strain UAMS-1 (ATCC 49230; American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, Md.) is an osteomyelitis clinical isolate. S. enterica serovarDublin (strain SL 1363) is a wild-type pathogenic strain. Both bacterial strainswere grown overnight in tryptic soy broth at 37\u00b0C with shaking. Bacteria wereharvested by centrifugation at 4,300 \ufffd g for 10 min, and bacterial pellets werewashed once with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The final pellet wassuspended in osteoblast growth medium without antibiotics. Osteoblast cultureswere briefly exposed (45 min) to various numbers of bacteria, followed bywashing three times with HBSS and then addition of medium containing genta-micin (25 \ufffdg/ml), to eliminate any viable extracellular bacteria. At various timespostinfection, cells or culture supernates were taken for the indicated analyses.The ratios of Staphylococcus or Salmonella cells to osteoblasts used for exposurein these studies were 250:1, 75:1, and 25:1, or 30:1, 10:1, and 3:1, respectively.These ratios were empirically determined to result in a limited intracellularinfection (i.e., less than 1%) and in limited cell death (i.e., less than 5%) duringthe indicated times in culture. In some experiments, osteoblasts were exposed topurified peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), andRNA was harvested 6 h after exposure.RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and semiquantitative PCR for CD40. Atvarious times following exposure to bacteria, RNA was extracted from culturedmouse or human osteoblasts, and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) wasperformed to detect the presence of CD40 mRNA using methodologies similarto those previously reported by our laboratories (4, 5). After PCR, amplifiedproducts were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromideand visualized under UV illumination. Densitometric analyses were performedfollowing import of each gel image (Adobe Photoshop; Adobe Systems, San Jose,Calif.) into NIH Image (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). A gel-plotting macrowas used to outline the bands, and the intensity was calculated on the uncali-brated OD setting. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-drogenase (G3PDH) was used to normalize PCR products to verify equal inputof RNA and similar efficiencies of reverse transcription. Results reported herewere always in the linear range of amplification for this message (data notshown). Positive and negative PCR primers used in this study included thefollowing: G3PDH, CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAG and CACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT, respectively; mouse CD40, CACTGACAAACAGTACCTCCACGATGG and TGGGCAGGGATGACAGACGGTATC; and hu-man CD40, AGCTCGGAATATCTAGCATCCC and TTACTTTGGCTACGAATGGCTGATG.Immunocytochemical staining of cultured osteoblasts to detect CD40 proteinfollowing infection. Mouse or human osteoblasts were cultured onto glass cov-erslips in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after exposure to various numbers ofbacteria, osteoblasts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at \ufffd20\u00b0Cand washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific and Fc receptor bindingwas blocked with bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1 mg/ml; Sigma) and 1%bovine serum albumin (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, Ga.) for 15 min at roomtemperature. Rat anti-mouse CD40 (1:100; clone 3/23; PharMingen, San Diego,Calif.) or mouse anti-human CD40 (1:100; clone 5C3; PharMingen) was added tothe appropriate coverslips for 2 h at room temperature. Duplicate coverslipswere also stained using identical concentrations of isotype-matched control an-tibodies, including rat IgG2a (1:100; clone R35-95; PharMingen) or mouse IgG1(1:100, clone A112-2; PharMingen), respectively. Following incubation with theprimary antibodies, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline\u20130.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-ratantibody or biotin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500; PharMingen), respec-tively, for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and incubated withstreptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:200) for 20 min at room temperature.Diaminobenzidine with nickel substrate reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-game, Calif.) was added for 20 min, followed by washing and counterstainingwith hematoxylin (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). Cells were dehydrated, andcoverslips were mounted on slides with Permount (Fischer Scientific) for micros-copy.Quantification of the percentage of cultured osteoblasts expressing CD40 byusing FACS analysis. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed to deter-mine the percentage of mouse or human osteoblasts expressing CD40. Culturedosteoblasts were uninfected or exposed to Staphylococcus (ratio of 75:1 bacteriato cells) or Salmonella (ratio of 3:1 bacteria to cells) for 45 min, followed byremoval of extracellular bacteria. At 24 h postinfection cells were removed fromflasks by brief exposure to 0.025% trypsin\u20130.01% EDTA and fixed using 4%paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Mouse or human osteoblasts were thenincubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD40(clone HM40-3; PharMingen) or FITC-conjugated anti-human CD40 (clone5C3; PharMingen) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, respectively. Duplicate cell preparations werealso stained using identical concentrations of isotype-matched control antibod-ies, including FITC-conjugated hamster IgM (clone G235-1; PharMingen) orFITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 (clone A112-2; PharMingen), respectively. Afterwashing off unbound antibody, 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed by using afluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson, SanJose, Calif.).Cytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on mouse or human osteoblasts.To demonstrate that ligation of CD40 on mouse or human osteoblasts couldresult in a functional response, cytokine secretion by these cells was quantified.For these studies, mouse or human osteoblasts were uninfected, or infected byexposing cells to Staphylococcus or Salmonella to upregulate CD40 expression.Following infection, mouse or human osteoblasts were treated with the agonists,soluble trimeric murine CD154 (26 \ufffdg/ml; Immunex, Seattle, Wash.) or solublehuman CD154/TRAP fusion protein (2 \ufffdg/ml; Chemicon International, Te-mecula Calif.), respectively. Supernates were collected 24 h later, and captureenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to quantifymouse interleukin-6 (IL-6; PharMingen), or human IL-6 and human granulo-cyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Research Diagnostics,Inc., Flanders, N.J.), respectively, using methodologies previously described (5).Cytokine concentrations in culture supernates were determined by extrapolationfrom standard curves.MIP-1\ufffd secretion in mixed cultures of osteoblasts and mitogen-activatedCD4\ufffd T lymphocytes. Cocultures of mouse osteoblasts and mitogen-activatedCD4\ufffd T lymphocytes were established in the presence of an antagonistic anti-body against CD40 or an isotype-matched control antibody. For these cultures,BALB/c splenic leukocytes were isolated (19) and stimulated for 24 h in thepresence of concanavalin A (1 \ufffdg/ml; Sigma Chemical Co.). Following activa-tion, CD4\ufffd T lymphocytes were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting, usingferritin-conjugated anti-CD4 beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, Calif.) as previ-ously described (19). These activated CD4\ufffd T lymphocytes were added to cul-tured BALB/c osteoblasts in the presence of anti-CD40 (10 \ufffdg/ml; cloneHM40-3; PharMingen), which has been shown to be an antagonist of CD40-CD154 interactions, or in the presence of an isotype-matched control antibody(10 \ufffdg/ml; clone G235-1; PharMingen). Supernates were collected 24 h later forquantification of macrophage inflammatory protein-1\ufffd (MIP-1\ufffd) secretion usingan ELISA (PharMingen).RESULTSCD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured mouseand human osteoblasts following infection with Staphylococcusor Salmonella. Since the T-lymphocyte response during boneinfection is not clear, and since bone cells are not recognized asbeing capable of providing significant costimulation, this study1210 SCHRUM ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.focused on the ability of bone-forming osteoblasts to expressfunctional CD40. After primary mouse osteoblasts were ex-posed to S. aureus or S. enterica serovar Dublin, colony countswere performed to quantify the numbers of intracellular bac-teria at 24 h postinfection. Less than 1% of the input bacteriaused to infect osteoblasts remained viable at this time point,demonstrating that the intracellular bacterial burden in thesecultures was modest (data not shown). In addition, greaterthan 95% of the osteoblasts remained viable throughout theculture period regardless of the level of bacterial exposure, aspreviously reported (4).Having defined the pathogen burden in these cultures, webegan studies to define the potential of these cells to regulateexpression of CD40 following infection. For these studies,RNA was isolated from osteoblasts exposed to various num-bers of Staphylococcus or Salmonella organisms and semiquan-titative RT-PCR was performed for CD40 mRNA expression.As shown in one representative study (Fig. 1A), constitutivelevels of CD40 mRNA expression were detected in uninfectedmouse osteoblasts. However, exposure to either Staphylococ-cus or Salmonella significantly increased expression of thismessage. From three separate RT-PCR analyses, fold in-creases \ufffd standard deviations in CD40 mRNA expressionwere 4.2 \ufffd 1.6 and 5.9 \ufffd 1.7 for Staphylococcus- (250:1) andSalmonella- (10:1) infected osteoblasts, respectively, comparedto CD40 message expression in uninfected cultures. Differ-ences in CD40 mRNA expression in Fig. 1A could not beascribed to differences in input RNA, or to differences in theefficiency of reverse transcription as evidenced by RT-PCRamplification of the housekeeping gene G3PDH for each sam-ple. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that as early as 4 h afterexposure to Staphylococcus (Fig. 1B) or Salmonella (Fig. 1C),significant increases in CD40 mRNA expression were ob-served. Therefore, despite the limited bacterial infection ofthese cultured osteoblasts, CD40 mRNA expression was rap-idly induced in these cells. Salmonella-derived LPS, but notpeptidoglycan, could stimulate cultured mouse osteoblasts toexpress CD40 mRNA (Fig. 1D). Thus, it was not necessary tohave intact, viable Salmonella to stimulate osteoblasts to ex-press CD40.The surprising ability of these bacterial pathogens to up-regulate CD40 mRNA expression was also observed in primarycultures of human osteoblasts (Fig. 2). Following bacterialinfection, RNA was isolated and semiquantitative RT-PCRwas performed for CD40 mRNA expression. Figure 2 showsone representative study demonstrating constitutive CD40mRNA expression that was upregulated following bacterialinfection. These results were strikingly similar to those ob-tained for mouse osteoblasts and together demonstrate theconserved nature of the response. Additional studies were alsoperformed on NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. NIH 3T3 cells wereexposed to either Staphylococcus or Salmonella as describedabove and monitored for CD40 mRNA expression. Unlikeosteoblasts, these conventional fibroblasts did not expressCD40 mRNA either constitutively or upon exposure to bacte-ria (data not shown).Immunocytochemical staining of cultured osteoblasts to de-tect CD40 protein following infection. To determine if in-creased mRNA expression translated into CD40 protein ex-pression, immunocytochemical analyses were performed. Therepresentative micrographs for mouse osteoblasts (Fig. 3, toppanels) clearly demonstrate an increase in CD40 immunostain-ing in Salmonella-infected (panel B) and Staphylococcus-in-fected (panel C) mouse osteoblasts, compared to uninfectedosteoblasts (panel A). Importantly, immunocytochemicalstaining of duplicate cultures using an isotype-matched controlmonoclonal antibody showed no such reactivity (panels D, E,FIG. 1. CD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured mouseosteoblasts following infection with Salmonella, S. aureus, or LPS, butnot peptidoglycan. (A) Mouse osteoblast cultures were exposed tovarious numbers of bacteria. The ratios of Salmonella or S. aureus cellsto osteoblasts used for exposure in these studies were 30:1, 10:1, and3:1 or 250:1, 75:1, and 25:1, respectively. At 6 h postinfection, RT-PCRanalysis was performed to detect expression of CD40 mRNA. Thesestudies were performed three times with similar results. (B) To inves-tigate the kinetics of the response, RNA was isolated at the indicatedtimes after exposure (0, 2, 4, and 6 h) to S. aureus (75:1) and RT-PCRwas performed. This study was performed twice with similar results.(C) Similarly, RNA was isolated at the indicated times after exposure(0, 2, 4, and 6 h) to Salmonella (3:1) and RT-PCR was performed. Thisstudy was performed twice with similar results. (D) Mouse osteoblastswere exposed to either LPS or peptidoglycan (PGN) (1,000, 100, or 10ng/ml) for 6 h and RT-PCR was performed to detect CD40 mRNAexpression. All results are presented as amplified PCR fragments elec-trophoresed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. RT-PCR am-plification of the housekeeping gene, G3PDH, was performed fornormalization.VOL. 71, 2003 CD40 EXPRESSION BY BACTERIALLY INFECTED OSTEOBLASTS 1211and F). Similar results were obtained when immunocytochem-ical analyses were performed on cultures of uninfected andbacterially infected human osteoblasts (bottom panels). West-ern blot analysis also showed an increase in CD40 proteinexpression in mouse osteoblasts exposed to either Staphylococ-cus or Salmonella (data not shown).Quantification of the percentage of cultured osteoblasts ex-pressing CD40 by using FACS analyses. To determine thepercentage of osteoblasts that expressed CD40, FACS analyseswere performed using mouse and human osteoblasts exposedto bacteria. FACS analysis (Fig. 4A) showed an increase in thepercentage of CD40-positive mouse osteoblasts following ex-posure to Staphylococcus (52% positive cells) or to Salmonella(66% positive cells) compared to the uninfected osteoblasts(19% positive cells).Similar results were obtained when FACS analyses wereperformed on human osteoblasts exposed to bacteria. An in-crease in the percentage of CD40-positive human osteoblastswas observed (Fig. 4B) following exposure to Staphylococcus(20% positive cells) or to Salmonella (30% positive cells) com-pared to uninfected osteoblasts (12%) (Fig. 4B).Cytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on mouse orhuman osteoblasts. Increased CD40 expression suggested thatthis molecule might be capable of signaling osteoblast respons-es; therefore, studies were performed to demonstrate the func-tionality of CD40 present on these cells. Mouse osteoblastswere exposed to Staphylococcus or Salmonella, with the intentof increasing expression of CD40 in the cultures exposed tothese bacteria. As expected (6), bacterial infection by itself wasa potent stimulus for inducing IL-6 secretion by these cells(Fig. 5A). Importantly, however, ligation of CD40 by solubletrimeric CD154 significantly enhanced IL-6 secretion by bac-terially infected osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). These results clearlydemonstrate CD40-mediated augmentation of the osteoblastresponse to these bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, solubletrimeric CD154 had little effect on the ability of uninfectedosteoblasts to induce IL-6 secretion (Fig. 5A), suggesting thatbacterial infection contributed in some manner to CD40-me-diated responsiveness.Ligation of CD40 also resulted in increased cytokine secre-tion from bacterially infected human osteoblasts (Fig. 5B andC). In the presence of the CD40 agonist, CD154/TRAP, Sal-monella-infected osteoblasts had increased levels of IL-6 thatwere significantly above that of infected osteoblasts alone (Fig.5B). Furthermore, in the presence of CD154/TRAP, GM-CSFsecretion was significantly increased over that observed in Sal-monella-infected cultures alone (Fig. 5C). Together, these re-sults clearly demonstrate that mouse and human osteoblastscan express functional CD40 molecules.Anti-CD40 antibody limits MIP-1\ufffd secretion in mixed cul-tures of osteoblasts and mitogen-activated CD4\ufffd T lympho-cytes. When mitogen-activated CD4\ufffd T lymphocytes are cocul-tured with mouse osteoblasts, a variety of cytokines andchemokines are secreted (our unpublished observations). Theinteractions between osteoblasts and T lymphocytes responsi-ble for this observation are not clear. However, since osteo-blasts can express functional CD40, interaction with CD154 onactivated T lymphocytes might represent one such mechanism.To begin to address this possibility, cocultures of mouse osteo-blasts and mitogen-activated CD4\ufffd T lymphocytes were estab-lished in the presence of an antagonistic antibody againstCD40. Figure 6 shows one representative experiment demon-strating a limited secretion of MIP-1\ufffd by activated CD4\ufffd Tlymphocytes alone or by osteoblasts alone. However, whencocultures of these two cell populations were established, sig-nificant levels of MIP-1\ufffd were present in supernates. Impor-tantly, addition of an anti-CD40 antibody, which is known toantagonize CD40-CD154 interactions, blocked a significantportion of MIP-1\ufffd secretion. An isotype-matched control an-tibody was unable to block secretion. However, it should benoted that although CD40 antagonistic antibody significantlyblocked MIP-1\ufffd secretion, secretion was not completelyblocked. This suggests that the addition of the CD40 antago-nistic resulted in an incomplete block or only partial antago-nistic activity, or that some other soluble factors or interactionsmay be involved in the initiation of the immune response ininfected osteoblasts. These results are consistent with the no-tion that osteoblasts and activated T lymphocytes can interactvia CD40 and CD154 to augment MIP-1\ufffd secretion.DISCUSSIONStrong support for the importance of CD40-CD154 interac-tions in the immune response against bacterial infectionscomes from clinical observations and from studies using exper-imental animal models. Patients with hyper-IgM syndrome donot express functional CD154, and they not only develop in-fections to encapsulated bacteria due to ineffective antibodyproduction but are also susceptible to the intracellular patho-gens Pneumocystis carinii (45) and Cryptosporidium parvum(27). In support of these clinical observations, mice geneticallydeficient in CD154 expression have limited T-lymphocyte-de-pendent macrophage-mediated immune responses (52), and inparticular have limited cellular immune responses to the intra-cellular pathogens Leishmania major (9) and Leishmania ama-zonensis (49). Furthermore, genetic disruption of CD40 orCD154 expression in mice results in the inability of theseanimals to clear C. parvum (14). Studies have demonstrated aprotective role for ligation of CD40 during mycobacterial in-fections (30). In addition, CD40 interactions were required foran antibody response against gram-positive Streptococcus (66).Further, our laboratory has provided evidence for a significantFIG. 2. CD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured humanosteoblasts following infection with Salmonella or S. aureus. Humanosteoblast cultures were exposed to various numbers of bacteria. Theratios of Salmonella or S. aureus cells to osteoblasts used for exposurein these studies were 10:1 and 3:1 or 250:1 and 75:1, respectively. At 6 hpostinfection, RT-PCR analysis was performed to detect expression ofCD40 mRNA. Results are presented as amplified PCR fragmentselectrophoresed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. RT-PCRamplification of the housekeeping gene, G3PDH, was performed.These studies were performed three times with similar results.1212 SCHRUM ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.role for CD40-CD154 interactions in mounting a successfulcellular immune response against gram-negative Salmonella(41). Not only was survival augmented in mice treated withexogenous soluble trimeric recombinant CD154, but also ani-mals were found to be more susceptible to this intracellularpathogen when interactions between CD40 and endogenousCD154 were antagonized using an anti-mouse CD154 mono-clonal antibody. Taken together, these findings provide strongsupport for CD40-CD154 interactions in the protective im-mune responses against diverse bacterial pathogens.FIG. 3. Immunocytochemical staining of cultured osteoblasts to detect CD40 protein following infection. Twenty-four hours after exposure ofmouse (top panel) or human (bottom panel) osteoblasts to media (none), to Salmonella (10:1), or to S. aureus (250:1), osteoblasts were fixed andincubated with the primary antibodies anti-mouse or anti-human CD40 or an isotype-matched control IgG, respectively. Results are presented asrepresentative micrographs from three separate experiments.VOL. 71, 2003 CD40 EXPRESSION BY BACTERIALLY INFECTED OSTEOBLASTS 1213The results presented here show clearly that bacterial infec-tion can induce primary cultured osteoblasts to express func-tional CD40 molecules. To demonstrate the functionality ofCD40 ligation, we focused on the secretion of two cytokines,IL-6 and GM-CSF, that are know to be secreted by osteoblasts(4) and that are known to be induced in other cell populationsfollowing ligation of CD40 (28). It should be noted that thesetwo cytokines were not the only ones induced by CD40 ligation(data not shown), but they serve to demonstrate the function-ality of CD40 expression in these studies. However, the factthat CD40-mediated signaling in osteoblasts resulted in cyto-kine secretion may have important implications for the protec-tive host response, as well as bone resorption that often ac-companies bone infections. IL-6 (2, 29, 35) and GM-CSF (20)are important mediators of the protective immune responseagainst bacterial pathogens. Therefore, if osteoblasts can beactivated to secrete such mediators during bone infections, thiscould be a significant source of cytokine production to drivethe local inflammatory response. Conversely, IL-6 (16, 33) andGM-CSF (43) can also contribute to osteoclastogenesis, whichultimately leads to bone resorption. Since bone infections areoften accompanied by loss of bone at the site of infection (24,64), it is possible that osteoblast-derived cytokines might exac-erbate activation of surrounding osteoclasts. The fact thatfunctional CD40 molecules are present on infected osteoblastssuggests a likely mechanism for osteoblast-induced cytokinesecretion.T lymphocytes infiltrate sites of bone infection (7, 50), and itis tempting to speculate that ligation of induced CD40 onosteoblasts by infiltrating T lymphocytes can contribute to thehost response against bacterial pathogens. Additional studiesFIG. 4. Quantification of the percentage of cultured osteoblastsexpressing CD40 by using FACS analysis. Cultured mouse (A) orhuman (B) osteoblasts were uninfected or exposed to S. aureus (75:1)or Salmonella (3:1). At 24 h postinfection, cells were removed fromflasks and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD40 or withFITC-conjugated anti-human CD40, respectively. Duplicate cell prep-arations were also stained using identical concentrations of isotype-matched control antibodies. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed byFACS analysis. Histographs show the percentage of CD40-positiveosteoblasts determined by comparison to cells stained in an identicalmanner with the appropriate control antibody. These studies wereperformed twice with similar results.FIG. 5. Cytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on osteo-blasts.

IMMUN.using models of bone infection will be required to make a moredefinitive association between T lymphocytes and osteoblasts.In addition, it will be important in future studies to distinguishbetween a protective host response versus destructive inflam-mation. Recent studies have focused on the positive contribu-tion that T lymphocytes can have on bone resorption (39, 54,57, 60) and in stimulating osteoclastogenesis (55). Conversely,some studies have suggested that activated T lymphocytes canstimulate bone formation (31). In view of the results presentedhere, T-lymphocyte-mediated ligation of CD40 expressed byosteoblasts is one additional mechanism that should be ex-plored as a possible cause for bone gain or loss during infectionwith bacterial pathogens.While much attention has been given to CD154 expressionby T lymphocytes, it is now clear that cells from other lineagesexpress, or can be induced to express, this molecule. In partic-ular, a variety of leukocytes, including cells of myeloid lineage(1, 22), can express CD154. Since osteoclasts are derived frommyeloid precursors (47, 56), it would be important to deter-mine if these cells could express CD154 during bone disease. Ifso, such osteoclasts would be in close proximity to ligate CD40expressed by osteoblasts.The recent realization that osteoblasts can express a varietyof molecules capable of modulating the immune response sug-gests that these cells may have an unappreciated role in thehost response, especially during infections of bone. Reports inthe literature have demonstrated that osteoblasts have thepotential to secrete certain cytokines and chemokines. A re-view of the literature includes the secretion of the proinflam-matory cytokines IL-1 (38), IL-6 (6, 33, 38), tumor necrosisfactor alpha (23), IL-12 (6), and IL-18 (59). Osteoblasts canalso secrete the colony-stimulating factors GM-CSF (4, 42),G-CSF (4, 53), and M-CSF (4, 63), as well as the chemokinesmonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (5, 65), MIP (36), andIL-8 (11). Interestingly, these cells have also been shown tosecrete transforming growth factor \t1 (46), which can be an-tiinflammatory. The present study demonstrates that osteo-blasts can also be induced to express CD40 in response to abacterial infection. Taken together, these studies suggest thatactivated osteoblasts are not passive participants in the hostresponse to infection, but rather have the potential to respondto such pathogens. In particular, the abilities of osteoblasts toexpress cytokines like IL-12 and IL-18 and to express CD40suggest that these cells may be able to provide signals forT-lymphocyte activation or to receive stimulation from infil-trating T lymphocytes.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grantsAR47585, GM58042, and AR47585.REFERENCES1.
