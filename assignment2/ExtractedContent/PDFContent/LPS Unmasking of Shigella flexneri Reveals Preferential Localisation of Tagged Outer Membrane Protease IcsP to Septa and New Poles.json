"pone.0070508 1..16LPS Unmasking of Shigella flexneri Reveals PreferentialLocalisation of Tagged Outer Membrane Protease IcsP toSepta and New PolesElizabeth Ngoc Hoa Tran., Matthew Thomas Doyle., Renato Morona*Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, AustraliaAbstractThe Shigella flexneri outer membrane (OM) protease IcsP (SopA) is a member of the enterobacterial Omptin family ofproteases which cleaves the polarly localised OM protein IcsA that is essential for Shigella virulence. Unlike IcsA however, thespecific localisation of IcsP on the cell surface is unknown. To determine the distribution of IcsP, a haemagglutinin (HA)epitope was inserted into the non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 using Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR, and IcsPHA wascharacterised. Quantum Dot (QD) immunofluorescence (IF) surface labelling of IcsPHA was then undertaken. Quantitativefluorescence analysis of S. flexneri 2a 2457T treated with and without tunicaymcin to deplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Oantigen (Oag) showed that IcsPHAwas asymmetrically distributed on the surface of septating and non-septating cells, andthat this distribution was masked by LPS Oag in untreated cells. Double QD IF labelling of IcsPHA and IcsA showed thatIcsPHA preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and to the septum of septating cells. The localisation ofIcsPHA in a rough LPS S. flexneri 2457T strain (with no Oag) was also investigated and a similar distribution of IcsPHA wasobserved. Complementation of the rough LPS strain with rmlD resulted in restored LPS Oag chain expression and loss ofIcsPHA detection, providing further support for LPS Oag masking of surface proteins. Our data presents for the first time thedistribution for the Omptin OM protease IcsP, relative to IcsA, and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.Citation: Tran ENH, Doyle MT, Morona R (2013) LPS Unmasking of Shigella flexneri Reveals Preferential Localisation of Tagged Outer Membrane Protease IcsP toSepta and New Poles.

IcsA (VirG) is a 120 kDa outer membrane (OM) proteinlocalised at the cell pole [3]. It mediates intracellular cytoplasmicmovement of S. flexneri in epithelial cells, and cell-to-cell spread, bythe assembly of an F-actin comet-tail at one pole of the bacterium[4\u20136]. This type of movement is described as actin-based motility(ABM). IcsA is secreted primarily at the \u2018old pole\u2019 of Shigellae [7]which is opposite the \u2018new pole\u2019 (the pole derived from the site ofseptation of the parent cell [8]. The 36.9 kDa IcsP (SopA) OMprotease of S. flexneri slowly cleaves IcsA at the Arg758\u2013 Arg759bond position [9] resulting in the release of a 95 kDa amino-terminal IcsA fragment that can be detected in culture superna-tants [5,10]. Analysis of icsP/sopA mutants has shown that IcsA isdetected across the entire surface of these bacteria with polarreinforcement [11,12]. Over-expression of IcsP results in thecomplete removal of IcsA from the cell surface [13].IcsP belongs to the Omptin family of proteases which consists of6 members; OmpT and OmpP of Escherichia coli, Pla of Yersiniapestis, PgtE of Salmonella enterica, Pla endopeptidase A of Erwiniapyrifoliae, and IcsP of Shigella flexneri. Immunogold labelling ofoverexpressed OmpP has shown that OmpP is symmetricallydistributed over the cell surface [14]. However to date, no studieshave attempted to describe the surface localisation of Omptinsexpressed at native levels. While it has been suggested that IcsPmay also be located uniformly across the cell surface [13], itsspecific distribution is currently unknown. In contrast to manyinner membrane proteins, such as FtsZ [15] and MreB [16]involved in cell division and cell shape, few OM proteins have hadtheir subcellular distribution determined. An exception to this isthe E. coli OM protein LamB which has been characterised to existas two populations: one that diffuses in a helical pattern, and onethat is relatively immobile [17,18]. The E. coli Iss and Bor proteinshave been detected on the cell surface with no distinct pattern[19]. A number of non-specific E. coli OM proteins were suggestedto be organised in stable helical swaths [20], and data by Shiomiet al. (2006) suggested that the general protein translocation Secmachinery itself may also be arranged in a helical array. WhetherIcsP possesses a distribution similar to these OM proteins, or hasan asymmetric distribution like IcsA, is the subject of this study.In addition to the above, mutations affecting lipopolysaccharide(LPS) have also been shown to affect the observed distribution ofOM proteins [21\u201324]. LPS is composed of three distinct regions:lipid A, core sugars and O antigen (Oag) polysaccharide chains.PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508Strains with LPS containing all 3 regions intact are known assmooth LPS strains. Shigella mutants lacking Oag are known asrough LPS strains. Such strains have been shown to have highlevels of circumferentially distributed IcsA on the cell surface (atboth cell poles and on lateral regions) [25,26], compared to thepolar localisation of IcsA seen in smooth LPS strains. Treatment ofY serotype derivatives of smooth LPS S. flexneri with bacteriophageSf6 tailspike protein (TSP) endorhamnosidase results in thehydrolysis of Oag chains and an increase detection of circumfer-ential IcsA on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence (IF)staining [21]. This suggests that the presence of LPS Oag masksthe observed distribution of IcsA on the cell surface and supportsthe idea that LPS Oag structure may block antibody accessibilityto the detection of surface proteins [22,23]. The effect of LPS Oagstructure on the detection and distribution of IcsP has not beeninvestigated.In this study, we investigated the distribution of IcsP by cellsurface quantum dot (QD) IF labelling of functional, HA-taggedIcsP (IcsPHA) in S. flexneri 2457T and establish that LPS Oag masksdetection of IcsPHAon the cell surface by using tunicamycin toinhibit Oag synthesis. Additional IF labelling with anti-IcsAantibodies to mark the location of the old pole suggested that IcsPis preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells andto the septa of septating cells. We also investigated the distributionof IcsP in a rough LPS 2457T strain to provide further support forthe LPS Oag masking hypothesis. Overall, our data presents forthe first time the cell surface distribution of the Omptin OMprotease IcsP and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.This distribution has implications for IcsA polarity determination,and a model is described to explain IcsP\u2019s contribution to IcsApolarity in S. flexneri.MethodsEthics StatementThe anti-IcsP and anti-IcsA antibodies were produced underthe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals forScientific Purposes and were approved by the University ofAdelaide Animal Ethics Committee.Bacterial Strains, Plasmids and MediaBacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed inTable 1. Bacteria were routinely grown at 37uC in Luria-Bertani(LB) broth with aeration or on Congo red agar [26]. Antibioticsused were as follows: 50 mg ampicillin (Amp) ml21; 25 mgchloramphenicol (Cml) ml21; 50 mg kanamycin (Kan) ml21.DNA MethodsE. coli K-12 DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. DNAmanipulation, PCR, transformation and electroporation wasperformed as previously described [27,28]. Anti-HA monoclonalantibody (#H3663) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IcsPand anti-IcsA antibodies were prepared as described previously[26,29]. The antibodies were produced under the National Healthand Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Code ofPractice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposesand were approved by the University of Adelaide Animal EthicsCommittee.Insertion of HA Epitope into IcsPThe sequence encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) wasinserted into the putatively non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 (basedon sequence alignments with E. coli OmpT) using SOE PCR[30,31]. In the first part of this two-step PCR technique, upstreamand downstream amplicons were amplified from S. flexneri 2457Tgenomic DNA using HA encoding primers (ET18/ET19) and icsP-specific primers (ET3/ET10) (Table 2). The two amplicons fromthis primary PCR were then mixed and used as a DNA templatefor the second round of PCR with primers ET3/ET10. In thissecond reaction, the HA encoding regions of the primary PCRamplicons overlap and prime one another to give the final icsPPCR product with an inserted HA epitope. The icsPHAfragmentwas then cloned into pGEMT-Easy and primers ET22/ET25(Table 2) were used to amplify an icsPHAproduct with KpnI andHindIII restriction enzyme sites from this construct. The resultantKpnI-HindIII fragment was digested and sub-cloned into likewisedigested pBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsPHA, also referred to aspIcsPHAin text (Table 1). Primers ET22/ET25 were also used toamplify the icsP gene from 2457T genomic DNA, and cloned intopBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP, referred to as pIcsP in text(Table 1). DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no mutationhad been introduced by PCR into the sequence, and the presenceof the in-frame HA epitope tag sequence.Construction of S. flexneri icsP mutantThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP-mutant strain was constructed usingallelic exchange mutagenesis [27] to inactivate the icsP gene byinsertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (kanR). Initially, the icsPgene was PCR amplified with primers ET3/ET4 containingBamHI and SacI restriction sites from 2457T genomic DNA. Theresultant PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI andsub-cloned into likewise digested pSL1180 (Table 1). Furtherdigestion with ClaI allowed insertion of the AccI-AccI digested kanRgene from pKTUWE (Table 1) to give pSL1180-icsP::kanR(Table 1). Following re-digestion with BamHI and SacI, theicsP::kanRfragment was cloned into pCACTUS (Table 1) andtransformed into S. flexneri 2457T via electroporation. Allelicexchange mutagenesis was performed as previously described [27].The icsP::kanRmutation in the virulence plasmid was confirmed byPCR with primers ET3/ET4 (Table 2) to give the 2457T icsP-mutant ETRM22 (Table 1).Construction of S. flexneri icsP2/rmlD- Double MutantThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP2/rmlD-mutant strain was constructedusing a modification of the l Red recombinase system to initiallydelete the rmlD gene [32]. Primers ET28/ET29 containing NheIrestriction enzyme sites (Table 2) were used to PCR amplify thekanRgene from pKD4 (Table 1). The amplified product wasligated into pGEMT-Easy and pGEMT-Easy::kanRwas digestedwith NheI. The NheI-kanR-NheI fragment was then subcloned intolikewise digested pRMA718 [26] to give pRMA718-rmlD::kanR(Table 1). This plasmid was then digested with BamHI and thermlD::KanRfragment was cloned into the BamHI site ofpCACTUS. The pCACTUS-rmlD::KanRconstruct was thenelectroporated into S. flexneri 2457T and allelic exchangemutagenesis was induced to give the 2457T rmlD::kanRmutantETRM230 (Table 1). ETRM230 was transformed with pCP20 at30uC to flip out the FRT flanked kanR gene and give the 2457TrmlD-mutant ETRM233 (Table 1). The rmlD mutation wasconfirmed by LPS analysis. ETRM233 was further electroporatedwith pCACTUS-icsP::kanR(Table 1) and another round of allelicexchange mutagenesis was performed to give the final 2457TrmlD2/icsP-double mutant ETRM240 (Table 1).Analysis of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein ProductionFor detection of native IcsP, strains were grown at 37uC in LBbroth with aeration for 16 h, subcultured 1/20 into fresh brothDistribution of the Outer Membrane Protease IcsPPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508and grown for another 3 h to an OD600 of ,1.

Cultures werethen pelleted by centrifugation (22196g, 10 min, Sigma 3K15centrifuge), washed 3 times in LB, and unless otherwise stated,induced with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose for 1 h to an OD600 of ,1.Cells (56108) were then harvested by centrifugation andresuspended in 2X sample buffer [33]. Protein samples weresolubilised at 100uC for 5 min, separated on SDS 15% polyacryl-amide gels, and stained with Coomassie R-250, or subjected toWestern immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membrane (Medos)with either polyclonal rabbit anti-IcsP antiserum (at 1/250dilution) or monoclonal mouse anti-HA (at 1/500 dilution).Detection was performed with goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse)horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (KPL) and chemi-luminescence reagent (Sigma). Benchmark prestained molecularweight markers (Invitrogen) were used as molecular size markers.Sucrose Gradient Density FractionationFractionation of the cell whole membrane (WM) into cytoplas-mic membrane (CM) and OM fractions was performed by sucrosegradient centrifugation according to the method of Osborn andMunson [34]. In brief, 200 ml cultures were grown and inducedwith arabinose as described above, harvested by centrifugation(9,8006g, 15 min, 4uC, JA14 rotor, Beckman centrifuge J2-21M),washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in 5 ml10 mM HEPES in 1 mM MgCl2. The bacterial suspension wasthen passed through a pre-cooled French Pressure cell (SLMAminco) once and re-centrifuged to remove cell debri. WM pelletswere collected by ultracentrifugation (115,0006g, 1 h, 4uC, 80 Tirotor, Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge),Table 1.

All IcsPHA(525 nm) and IcsA (625 nm) channel images were acquired with1 sec and 0.1 sec exposures respectively using an X-Cite 120Qlamp set at high intensity as the excitation source. The excitationfilter used was FF01-435/40-25 (Semrock) and the emission filterswere FF01-525/15-25 and FF01-625/15-25 (Semrock). SemrockFF510-Di01-25636 dichroics were used.Fluorescence Quantification of QD Labelled SurfaceIcsPHAData for intensity profile plots were extracted from images usingMetaMorph\u2019s Line-scan function which averages intensities acrossthe perpendicular axis of a point-to-point scan. Single scans wereconducted from pole-to-pole with width (perpendicular axis) equalto the bacterium (approx. 20 pixels). Cumulative scans of the525 nm wavelength (IcsPHA) for non-septating cells were con-ducted for 50 bacteria from each independent sample. Eachbacterium was scanned from the new pole to old pole where IcsAwas used as a marker of the old pole. From the same samples, allseptating cells from captured images were scanned starting fromthe septum to the old pole of one daughter cell chosen at random.An average of 26.8 septating bacteria were scanned for eachsample. Intensity data was then exported to MS Excel usingMetaMorph\u2019s Dynamic Data Exchange and subsequently ana-lysed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significances were testedby Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test.ResultsDetection of IcsP Expression by Western Immunoblottingand ImmunofluorescenceIn initial experiments to detect cell surface IcsP, the optimaltime point for IcsP expression in S. flexneri was determined.Western immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-IcsP was performed onwhole cell lysates collected from wild-type S. flexneri 2457T and the2457T icsP-mutant (icsP-) grown for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 h aftersubculture. A band consistent with the size of the IcsP protein(,36 kDa) was detected at time points after 1.5 h for 2457T (Fig.Figure 3.

We reasoned that IcsP levels at this time point werehigh enough for subsequent immunofluorescent detection of IcsP.No expression of IcsP was observed for icsP-as expected (Fig. 1A,lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12). Subsequent attempts to detect IcsP onthe surface of 2457T with rabbit anti-IcsP however wereunsuccessful, even in a rough LPS strain (data not shown). Wespeculate that as the IcsP protein used to raise antisera waspurified under denaturing conditions, this may have affected theresulting antibody\u2019s ability to detect native IcsP. However,difficulties with IF detection of cell surface IcsP with a polyclonalantibody have also been reported by others [13]. Hence, in analternative approach to investigate the distribution of IcsP on thebacterial cell surface, a HA epitope was inserted into the IcsPprotein.Figure 4.

A sample from each culture was then fixed and subjected to QD IF usingantibodies for HA epitope and IcsA. Fluorescence intensity scans of IcsPHA(525 nm wavelength) were conducted on multiple bacteria from eachindependent sample and accumulated scans were used to create mean intensity profiles. A total 450 non-septating bacteria were scanned for eachstrain. A further 355, 256, 172, and 173 septating bacteria were scanned for Oag-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA], Oag-depleted icsP- [pBAD30], icsP-/rmlD-[pIcsPHA], and icsP-/rmlD- [pBAD30] respectively.

OM loops 2 and 4 were notselected for HA tag insertion to avoid the proposed catalyticresidues present in OmpT [38] which also exist in IcsP (Fig. 2C).The IcsPHA(as well as IcsP) coding regions were placed in front ofthe pBAD promoter in pBAD30 [39] to allow expression controlwith arabinose. Expression of IcsP/IcsPHAwas confirmed byWestern immunoblotting with anti-IcsP or anti-HA antibodies(Fig. 3A & B, lanes WM and Fig. 1A & C).IcsPHA Activity on IcsATo determine whether insertion of a HA epitope into the OM ofIcsP affected IcsP\u2019s protease activity on IcsA, pellet andsupernatant protein preparations of 2457T, icsP-and arabinose-induced icsP-strains expressing pIcsPHA, pIcsP and pBAD30 weresubjected to Western immunoblotting with an anti-IcsA antibody.The full length 120 kDa IcsA protein was detected in cell pelletsamples of all strains as expected (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9),while the 95 kDa cleaved form of IcsA was only detected in thesupernatant sample of 2457T, icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pIcsP](Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 6 & 8). These results suggest that the insertion ofthe HA tag into the OM loop 5 of IcsP does not affect its ability tocleave IcsA, and hence the IcsPHAprotein is functional.Localisation of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein to the OMSince IcsPHAwas modified compared to IcsP and expressedfrom the pBAD promoter, the presence of IcsPHAproteinexclusively in the OM was confirmed by using sucrose densitygradient centrifugation. The WM of icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pIcsP] were fractionated into CM and OM on sucrose gradients,and fractions subjected to SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis, prior to visualisation by Coomassie Blue staining andWestern immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-IcsP. Analysis ofthe sucrose gradient samples showed that fractions which wereenriched with OM proteins (OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA) [40]contained the majority of the 36 kDa IcsPHAand IcsP proteins(Fig. 3A & B, lanes 2 to 5). These results indicate that IcsPHAislocalised to the OM similar to IcsP, and that the HA insertion didnot result in any dramatic disruption of IcsP protein localisation.Detection of Arabinose Induced IcsPHA Expression byWestern ImmunoblottingWild-type S. flexneri 2457T showed optimal expression levels ofnative IcsP at 3 h (Fig. 1A). To investigate the conditions requiredfor comparable IcsPHAexpression, whole cell lysate samples wereprepared from icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pBAD30] induced with0%, 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.0125%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% or 0.2%(w/v) arabinose for 1 h. Western immunoblotting with anti-IcsPshowed that a band of ,36 kDa was detected for 2457T and icsP-[pIcsPHA] induced with 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% (w/v) (w/v) arabinose (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3\u20136), with expression levelscomparable to native IcsP for icsP-[pIcsPHA] observed between0.025%\u20130.05% (w/v) arabinose induction (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 & 6).Induction at 0.03% (w/v) arabinose was hence chosen for allsubsequent experiments.Cell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in S. flexneri2457T and the Effect of Tunicamycin TreatmentHaving established an induction protocol that closely approx-imates the level of expression of IcsPHAto native IcsP, we nextattempted to detect IcsPHAat these levels on the surface of 2457TicsP-using indirect QD IF microscopy. Strains icsP-[pIcsPHA] andicsP-[pBAD30] were cultured with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, fixed,and then probed for HA using a primary anti-HA antibody and asecondary QD 525 conjugated antibody. However, no IcsPHAwasdetected on the cell surface, and intensity scans of icsP-[pIcsPHA]were equivalent to icsP-[pBAD30] (Fig. S1).Since IcsPHAcould not be detected on the cell surface of icsP-[pIcsPHA], we reasoned that the presence of LPS Oag may maskthe detection of surface IcsP as this has previously been shown forIcsA [21]. An LPS Oag depletion-regeneration assay [29] washence carried out on icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pBAD30] inducedwith 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, followed by IF labelling. This assayinvolves the use of an inhibitor of the WecA enzyme necessary forOag subunit biosynthesis using tunicamycin, and polymyxin Bnonapeptide (PMBN) was used to improve OM penetration. Uponremoval of these two chemicals from growing bacteria, LPS Oag isregenerated [29]. Analysis of the resulting LPS by SDS-PAGE andsilver staining showed that icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pBAD30]samples treated with tunicamycin/PMBN (TP) had depleted LPSOag (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 & 6), with Oag production restored (R) uponremoval of TP (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 & 8). Untreated (U) and PMBNtreated (P) samples showed no inhibition of Oag biosynthesis asexpected (Fig. 4A, lanes 1\u20134).Following successful depletion of LPS Oag, QD IF microscopywas performed on the above mentioned samples. IcsPHAcould notbe detected on untreated or PMBN treated icsP-[pIcsPHA] cells, asexpected (Fig. S2A). However, surface IcsPHAwas detected onicsP-[pIcsPHA] cells treated with TP, suggesting that LPS Oag isable to mask antibody accessibility to IcsPHA(Fig. S2A).Interestingly, IcsPHAappeared to be distributed asymmetricallyover the cell surface of the majority of cells examined andfluorescence intensity line-scans revealed that IcsPHAlocalisedpreferentially to one pole of non-septating cells and the septa ofseptating cells (Fig. S2A). To determine if the distribution ofIcsPHAon the cell surface segregated to either the new pole or theold pole, additional staining of the bacteria was conducted withanti-IcsA antibodies since IcsA is known to localise to the old cellpole [5]. Again, IcsPHAcould not be detected on untreated orPMBN treated icsP-[pIcsPHA] cells (Fig. 5A & B) but could bedetected after TP treatment (Fig. 5C). Peak IcsPHAdetection wasconsistently observed at the new pole (opposing IcsA at the oldpole) and at the septum of septating bacteria as shown by line-scans (Fig. 5C). As expected, no surface IcsPHAwas detected foruntreated, PMBN treated, or TP treated samples of icsP-[pBAD30] when stained for IcsPHA(Fig. S2B) or double stainedfor IcsPHAand IcsA (Fig. S3). Notably, IcsA on icsP-[pBAD30]was detected at higher amounts laterally and at the septa ofbacteria (Fig. S3) as previously seen for DicsP strains [13].Cell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in RoughLPS S. flexneri 2457TTo further investigate the effect of Oag on IcsP distribution, a2457T icsP2/rmlD-double mutant was constructed to indepen-old poles of septating bacteria. Student\u2019s two-tailed t-tests (D) were also conducted on the fold differences of mean IcsPHA intensities betweendiscrete positions (new pole, old pole, and septum) of Oag-depleted icsP- and icsP-/rmlD- bacteria.

Mutation of the rmlD gene in S. flexneri results in astrain which is unable to synthesise the precursor deoxythymidinediphosphate (dTDP)- rhamnose required for Oag repeat units and,hence, results in a rough LPS phenotype [29,41]. Analysis of theresulting LPS conferred by icsP2/rmlD-strains expressing pIcsPHAand pBAD30 showed that rough LPS was observed for both (Fig.4B, lanes 1 & 2), with a band consistent with the size of the IcsPHAprotein (36 kDa) detected only in the icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA]sample by Western immunoblotting, as expected (Fig. 4C, lane 1).Fixed samples of icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30] cells were then probed for both IcsPHAand IcsA usingthe same QD IF staining protocol as previously conducted forsmooth strains. Similarly to LPS Oag-depleted icsP-[pIcsPHA],IcsPHAwas detected on the bacterial surface most predominatelyat the new pole (Fig. 6A) and the septum (Fig. 6B). Again, themajority of septating cells had higher peak IcsPHAintensity at theseptum than new poles of non-septating cells (line-scans Fig. 6A &B). Single staining of these cells for IcsPHAwas also conducted andyielded the same localisation results (Fig. S4). As expected, IcsPHAwas not detected on the icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30] strain in IFmicroscopy experiments when either single (Fig. S4) or doublestained (Fig. 6B). Again, IcsA on icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30] wasdetected at higher amounts laterally and at the septum (Fig. 6A &B).To again demonstrate the effect of LPS Oag masking of IcsPHA,smooth LPS structure was restored in the icsP2/rmlD-strainexpressing pIcsPHAby transforming pRMA727 carrying afunctional rmlD gene. Analysis of the resulting LPS conferred byicsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA][pRMA727] showed restored smooth LPSphenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 3), and when probed for IcsPHAby QDIF microscopy, was barely detectable (Fig. 7A). The control icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] strain carrying pACYC184 conferred a roughLPS phenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and IcsPHAwas detected by IFmicroscopy with the same distribution observed previously (Fig.7B).Multi-cell Line-scan Analysis of IcsPHA SurfaceDistributionTo determine if the observed sub-cellular preference of IcsPHAto the new poles and septa is a statistically significant phenom-enon, cumulative QD IF line-scan analyses on both IcsPHA/IcsAdouble stained LPS Oag-depleted icsP-strains and rough icsP2/rmlD-strains was conducted for a larger population of cells.Scanning was initiated from the new pole to the old pole (asmarked by IcsA) for non-septating cells, and from the septum tothe old pole for septating cells (Fig 8C). From 9 independentsamples of LPS Oag-depleted icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pBAD30],a total of 450 non-septating cells each were line-scanned.Additionally a total of 355 and 256 septating cells were scannedfor icsP-[pIcsPHA] and icsP-[pBAD30] respectively. The resultantmean fluorescence intensity profiles show that IcsPHAis preferen-tially localised at the new pole and tends to gradually decreasetowards the old pole on non-septating cells expressing pIcsPHA(Fig. 8A). For septating cells, IcsPHAmean intensity is localisedhighest at the septum and declines more steeply towards the oldpole (Fig. 8A). As expected, the intensity profiles of icsP-[pBAD30]cells were at a negligible level (Fig. 8A). Statistical analysis of meanIcsPHAintensity at discrete bacterial positions of LPS-depletedicsP-[pIcsPHA] confirmed that the localisation of IcsPHAis: (i) 2-fold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole(P = 0.004), (ii) 2.9-fold higher at the septum of septating cells thanthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.5-fold higher at septa ofseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells(P = 0.038) (Fig. 8D).For the rough LPS strains, 9 independent samples of icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30] were investigated witha total of 450 non-septating cells each line-scanned. Additionally, atotal of 172 and 173 septating cells were scanned for icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30] respectively.

Likewise,IcsPHAmean intensity of septating cells is localised highest at theseptum and declines very steeply towards the old pole (Fig. 8B). Asexpected, the mean intensity profiles of icsP2/rmlD-[pBAD30]were at a negligible level (Fig. 8B). Statistical analysis of meanIcsPHAintensity at discrete bacterial positions of icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] again confirmed that the localisation of IcsPHAis: (i) 2.2-fold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole(P,0.0001), (ii) 3.6-fold higher at the septum of septating cells thanthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.7-fold higher at septa ofseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells(P = 0.0002) (Fig. 8D). Although, IcsPHAfluorescence intensity wasan average of 2.5 times higher on icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] cells thanLPS-depleted icsP-[pIcsPHA] cells, the ratios of intensity betweenbacterial positions were comparable to the respective fold-changesobserved for LPS Oag-depleted icsP-[pIcsPHA], suggesting thatIcsPHAis localised similarly in both types of Oag deficient cells.The lower level of IcsPHAdetection on LPS-depleted icsP-[pIcsPHA] compared to icsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA] indicates that TPtreatment is not 100% efficient in inhibiting Oag synthesis.DiscussionThe cell surface distribution of neither IcsP, or any othermember of the Omptin family, had not been previouslydetermined. In this study we investigated the distribution of IcsPon the cell surface of S. flexneri 2a 2457T using a HA-tagged IcsPprotein (Fig. 2) under pBAD control. Characterisation of IcsPHAshowed that it was functionally able to cleave IcsA, and wassecreted into the OM comparably to IcsP (Fig. 1B & 3). However,when IcsPHAwas expressed at native IcsP equivalent levels (Fig.1A & C), it was undetectable in the OM via QD IF microscopy insmooth LPS S. flexneri (Fig. S1) but detectable on both LPS Oag-depleted and rough LPS Shigella bacteria (Fig. 4, 5 & 6).Furthermore, this masking effect was restored in rough strainsupon complementation of rmlD (Fig. 4B & 7). We suggest that thelong LPS Oag chains of smooth strains sterically hinder theaccessibility of antibodies to the OM surface. This type of proteinmasking by LPS Oag has also been shown for IcsA in 2457T [21],and several other OM proteins [22,23]. It is interesting to note thatmulti-cell line-scan analysis of IcsPHAdetection on the cell surfaceshowed that IcsPHAfluorescence intensity was higher for roughLPS cells than for LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8). Similar to itsOmptin homolog, OmpT, IcsP possesses most of the putative LPS-binding sites found in OmpT (Fig. 2C) [38] and may also interactwith LPS. Since TP is only partly effective at blocking LPS Oagsynthesis, it is possible that the few LPS Oag molecules synthesisedare still closely bound to IcsP. This may cause a small amount ofmasking and may explain the lower fluorescence intensityobserved on LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8A) compared to therough LPS cells (Fig. 8B).IcsA distributions in DicsP strains previously provided indirectevidence to suggest that IcsP is distributed equally over the cellsurface of S. flexneri [12,13,42]. However, once the masking effectof LPS Oag was circumvented, we were able to extensively studythe distribution profile of IcsPHAin the OM. This work has shownthat IcsPHA(and likely IcsP) has an asymmetrical distributionwhich may be cell cycle dependent. On dividing cells IcsPaccumulates at high concentration at the septum and then declinessteeply towards the old pole of the emerging daughter cell.However, once divided, detection of IcsP at the new pole (the polederived from the septum) of daughter cells decreased significantlyand then the decline towards the old pole is more moderate. Toexplain this, we propose that IcsP is directed to septa of dividingcells and that daughter cells \u2018inherit\u2019 a higher concentration of IcsPat new poles (model Fig. 9). As the daughter cell elongates, IcsP islaterally diluted, resulting in the gentle gradient on non-septatingcells. In this model, lateral dilution of IcsP may occur bymembrane insertion events during cell elongation similarly to thatdescribed for E. coli LamB [43]. This model predicts increasedcleavage of IcsA at the septum and lateral regions of the cell inorder to help set up a relatively higher concentration of IcsA at theold pole and to maintain the old pole preference of IcsA indaughter cells. Additionally, the model may explain, and also fits,the common observation that IcsA distributions and intensitiesvary between cells in a given population of the same strain.Many proteins are known to accumulate at the inner membraneof the mid-cell in order to mediate septum formation and celldivision \u2013 for instance, FtsZ polymerises at the cytoplasmic face toform the Z-ring and attract further divisome components [44].However, few OM proteins have been shown to concentrate to theseptum. A notable exception to this is the OM lipoprotein LpoBwhich localises as distinct foci at septa and complexes withperiplasmic penicillin binding protein 1B tethering it to otherdivisome components [44,45]. Interestingly, septal localisation ofLpoB is lost when peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited [45].Whether the localisation of integral OM protein IcsP to the septalOM requires similar interactions with divisome components, or isdependent on peptidoglycan synthesis, remains to be investigated.In summary, this work has shown for the first time the surfacelocalisation of IcsP, a member on the Omptin family of OMproteases. We have observed that: (i) the distribution of IcsP ismasked by LPS Oag in S. flexneri 2457T, and (ii) IcsP isconcentrated at new poles and at the septum of dividing cells.This distribution of IcsP explains the observed IcsA localisationdefect in DicsP strains [11,12]. We have also proposed a model toexplain the inheritance of OM proteins IcsP and IcsA throughgenerations of cell division. Finally, unmasking of surface antigensvia LPS Oag-depletion may be useful in the study of otherminimally exposed OM proteins.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Inability to detect IcsPHAon the cell surface of2457T icsP-.
