TheGoIL-2 shows, respectively, 79%, 82e85%, and 91e92% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in cDNA, and alsoshows, respectively, 63%, 63e64%, and 82e85% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in amino acid sequence. RecombinantGoIL-2 (rGoIL-2) protein expressed in Escherichia coli has an approximate molecular weight of 18 kDa. The rGoIL-2 has biologicaleffect on goose and duck as well as chicken lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, though the effect on duck and chickenlymphocytes has been found to be relatively weak. In addition, rGoIL-2 also strengthens goose immune responses induced byvaccinating the inactivated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rGoIL-2recognized the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2 protein expressed in vero cells. Antiserum and mAb 5B10 to rGoIL-2 can inhibitthe biological activity of rGoIL-2 and endogenous GoIL-2. The results, at the first time, indicated that goose IL-2 reserves species-specialties in the biological functions and can be used as a potential immunoadjuvant for goose vaccination and immunotherapeuticpurposes. Finally, the mAbs to rGoIL-2 also provide a useful tool for further immunobiological studies of IL-2 in avian immunesystems.\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionIL-2 is a glycoprotein produced principally byactivated T cells and some B cells and a cytokine thatregulates lymphocyte function. IL-2 controls the ampli-fication of native T cells by initially stimulating growthfollowing antigen activation, and also has effects on NKcells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [1e4].IL-2 has been developed as an immunotherapeutic agentin chronic microbial infection and cancer, and as anenhancing agent in vaccine [5e7].

IL-2R is composed of three distinct subunits:IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb and IL-2Rg which are encoded, re-spectively, by distinct and structurally unrelated genes[9]. Resting T cells express low levels of IL-2Ra-subunit(Tac antigen) that binds to IL-2 with a low affinity.IL-2Rb-subunit alone or in combination with a or gproduce a receptor with intermediate affinity, and theg-subunit alone does not bind IL-2, while a receptorcomprised of three subunits offers the highest affinity forIL-2 [8].Up to now, in addition to human IL-2, IL-2 genes formore than 30 animal species also have been cloned andidentified [10]. Recently, IL-2 gene for chicken (ChIL-2)and turkey (TuIL-2) have been cloned and sequencedmailto:jyzhou@zju.edu.cnhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666329J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338successfully [11e13]. The ChIL-2 gene is mapped tochromosome 4, linked to annexin V with synteny withmouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4 [12].Our previous study revealed that some variations exist inthe open reading frame (ORF) of ChIL-2 from differentchicken breeds [14]. The cDNAcoding forChIL-2 proteinwas introduced into several prokaryotic and eukaryoticexpression systems to produce biologically active re-combinant cytokines [13,15,16]. ChIL-2 plays an impor-tant role as an immunoregulatory molecule identical tomammalian IL-2 and has been shown to stimulate Tlymphoblast cells, increase the proportion of both CD4CandCD8Cperipheral bloodT cells [17], enhanceNK cellsactivity and vaccine response to Eimeria parasites [18],and strengthen the protective immunity against infectiousbursal disease virus [19], indicating that ChIL-2 haspractical importance in potentially enhancing immuneresponses to vaccines and infectious agents in poultry.Furthermore, mAbs to ChIL-2 have also been produced,and used to study the biological activities of ChIL-2[20,21]. Comparatively, little work has been performed onavian IL-2s and their receptors. Only a mAb designatedINN-CH-16 can react with a 48e50 kDa antigen ex-pressed on activated chicken T lymphocytes and inhibitedthe proliferation of Con A-stimulated blasts in responseto supernatants of stimulated chicken T cells. Thesefeatures led to the hypothesis that INN-CH-16 mayrecognize the ChIL-2R [22,23].As for waterfowl cytokines in 1997, Bertram et al.[24] found lymphokines released by duck peripheralblood lymphocytes and splenocytes stimulated withPHA, which was of similar functional homology toChIL-2 in maintaining the lymphocyte proliferation.Recently, the cloning and functional characterization ofduck IL-2 have been reported [25e27]. However, noinformation was available on the goose cytokines.Hereby, the goal of the present study was to molecularlyclone the cDNA fragment of goose IL-2 (GoIL-2), toexpress the GoIL-2 open reading frame in vitroexpression system, to prepare mAbs to GoIL-2, and todetect the bioactivity of the recombinant GoIL-2(rGoIL-2) protein in vitro and in vivo.2. Results2.1. Molecular cloning and analysis of gooseIL-2 cDNAThe mRNA was isolated from goose SMC stimulatedwith 10 mg/ml Con A at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 48and 72 h. GoIL-2 cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR using these mRNAs as templates. An approxi-mately 0.8 kb DNA fragment, in size, was amplifiedfrom nine of the 12 mRNAs (Fig. 1). The sequencingresults revealed that cDNA fragment of GoIL-2 was718 nt in length (GenBank accession no. AY392557).GoIL-2 cDNA fragment encodes a polypeptide of 141amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of16.29 kDa. Analysis of the signal peptide revealed thatthere was a potential cleavage site between amino acidresidues 21 and 22 (arrow in Fig. 2). The predicted signalpeptide of GoIL-2 was similar in size to that ofmammalian animals (20 aa) and other birds (22 aa).The deduced amino acid sequence of GoIL-2 wascompared with those of the several avian andmammalianspecies. The alignment analysis showed that GoIL-2shared 85% identity to DuIL-2 (GenBank accessionno. AY193713), 63% to ChIL-2 (GenBank accession no.AF294321), 64% to TuIL-2 (GenBank accessionno. AJ007463), 9% to human IL-2 (GenBank accessionno. U25676), and 7e20% to other mammalian IL-2s. Asshown in Fig. 2, in IL-2 sequences of the compared avianspecies, there are 78 conserved amino acid residuesincluding three cysteine residues (position 63, 70 and119), indicating that there is at least one di-sulfate bond inthe molecules. However, Lys48andAsn80are present onlyin GoIL-2 amino acid sequence. Thr34,45,114, Lys73,105,Ile75,110, Asp86,90, Glu104and Arg132are the conservedamino acid residues in goose and duck IL-2s, but arevariable in chicken and turkey IL-2s. On the contrary,four amino acid residues (Ala14, Ile42, His51and Leu131)were conserved in chicken and turkey IL-2s, but werevariable in goose and duck IL-2s. Phylogenetic analysis(Fig. 3) shows further that the avian IL-2s weresubdivided into two monophyletic lineages. The gooseand duck IL-2s formed a monophyletic group distinctfrom ChIL-2 and TuIL-2, confirming the similaritybetween duck and goose IL-2s.2.2. Expression and purification of theHis-GoIL-2 fusion proteinThe gene fragment encoding GoIL-2 protein (withoutsignal peptide) was cloned into the pBAD/His Bexpression vector, where the araB promoter is controlledby arabinose.

Production and identification ofmAbs specific for GoIL-2Following immunization with rGoIL-2 protein puri-fied under denaturing conditions as an immunogen, fivemurine hybridoma clones were identified to producemAbs (3B2, 5B10, 3C4, 5D4 and 2F7). Data in Table 1showed that all these mAbs recognized rGoIL-2 byELISA and Western blot assays. The mAbs did notreact with 6!Histamine, rChIL-2 or with rDuIL-2.Isotype of the five mAbs was found to be all IgG1 and kchain. Rabbit antiserum against rGoIL-2 produced asdescribed in Section 4.4 could also specifically react withrGoIL-2, but do not react with any protein in the celllysate of Escherichia coli LMG194 strain transformedwith empty pBAD/His B (data not shown).2.4. Eukaryotic expression of GoIL-2In order to express the GoIL-2 protein in theeukaryotic cells, pEGFP-GoIL-2 plasmid was trans-fected into vero cells. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EGFP-GoIL-2 expressed in vero cells as early as 3 h aftertransfection. In immunocytochemical staining, theacetone-fixed pEGFP-GoIL-2-transfected vero cellswere detected, respectively, by five mAbs to rGoIL-2(Fig. 5deh), while no signal was observed in vero cellstransfected with pEGFP-c2 vector (Fig. 5c), demon-strating that these mAbs hold the epitopes of GoIL-2protein expressed in vero cells.2.5. In vitro bioactivity of goose IL-2The concentration of the E. coli-derived solublerGoIL-2 in the protein preparation was 0.656 mg/ml.The biological activity of E. coli-derived rGoIL-2 andendogenous GoIL-2 was tested by in vitro proliferationof goose, duck and chicken spleen cells. Goose(5! 106 cells/well), duck (5! 106 cells/well) and chicken(5! 106 cells/well) spleen cells were cultured in thepresence of either rGoIL-2, irrelevant protein control,RPMI-1640eFCS or the supernatants from Con A-stimulated SMC in a series of 2-fold dilutions. Data inFig. 6A showed that 1.6 ng rGoIL-2/well can significantlystimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes,while rGoIL-2 was 6.3 ng/well for duck lymphocytesand 25 ng/well for chicken lymphocytes. These resultsindicated that the stimulation effect of rGoIL-2 on bothchicken and duck lymphocytes was weak. On the otherhand, 0.8 ng/well rChIL-2 was needed in the proliferationassay of chicken lymphocytes and 12.5 ng rChIL-2/wellfor duck lymphocytes and 6.3 ng rChIL-2/well for gooselymphocytes (Fig. 6B). 6.3 ng/well rDuIL-2 inducessignificantly in vitro proliferation of duck lymphocytesFig. 5.

Neither the protein control from E. coliLMG194 strain transfected with pBAD/His B vectoralone, nor the RPMI-1640eFCS could stimulate theproliferation of activated goose, duck and chickenlymphocytes.2.6. Ability of mAbs to neutralize the biologicalactivity of recombinant and endogenous IL-2Five mAbs and one pAb to rGoIL-2 were tested fortheir ability to neutralize the biological function of therecombinant and endogenous GoIL-2 as measured bythe inhibition of Con A-stimulated lymphocyte pro-liferation. Only mAb 5B10 and pAb exhibited neutral-izing activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). mAb5B10 neutralized 85% of the lymphocyte-stimulatingactivity of rGoIL-2 and 80% for endogenous GoIL-2.The inhibiting effect of pAb on the activity of rGoIL-2and endogenous GoIL-2 was found to be 100%.2.7. In vivo immune response to AIV vaccine inducedby rGoIL-2Following the intramuscular inoculations with therGoIL-2 and the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine,blood samples were collected at specified times and theserum HI antibody to AIV was measured. As shown inTable 2, in gooses injected intramuscularly with bothrGoIL-2 protein (300 ng or 350 ng per goose, respec-tively) and AIV vaccine 2 weeks after immunization, theaverage titers of HI antibodies to AIV reached 6.3e6.4log 2, while the average titers of HI antibody to AIVwere 5.2e5.3 log 2 in gooses only vaccinated with AIVvaccine or with both 250 ng rGoIL-2 and AIV vaccine.The results clearly showed that 300 ng rGoIL-2 pergoose strengthened in vivo immune responses inducedby the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine.3. DiscussionUp to date, information about goose IL-2 has notbeen available. Recently, the cloning and functionalcharacterization of chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s havebeen reported [11e15,17,25e27]. The amino acid identityamongst these avian IL-2s was up to 58e73%. In thisreport, the goose IL-2 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCRusing primers based on the highly conserved regionsamong chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s. We found thatGoIL-2mRNAwas undetectable usingRT-PCR in gooseSMC 1 h and 72 h after Con A stimulation, but wasdetected in all samples from 2 h to 48 h after stimulation,showing that GoIL-2 expression began 1 h after stimula-tion and stopped 72 h after stimulation. Sundick et al. [11]detected the ChIL-2 mRNA 5 h after stimulation withConA. Inmitogen-stimulatedmouse spleen cells, the IL-2gene is only transiently expressed with maximal mRNAsteady state levels between 6e14 h post-stimulation [28].IL-2 mRNA expression of northern elephant seal peakedin the first 8 h following Con A stimulation [29].Whether rGoIL-2 protein expressed in E. coli pos-sessed a biological function, we measured the bioactivityof GoIL-2 protein using in vitro lymphocyte proliferationand in vivo immune responses of AIV vaccine vaccina-tion. As little as 1.6 ng/well of rGoIL-2 could significantlystimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocyteswhile 6.3 ng rGoIL-2/well was needed for duck lympho-cytes and 25 ng rGoIL-2/well for chicken lymphocyteswere need (Fig. 6A). In addition, after each goose wasintramuscularly vaccinated with a dose of 300e350 ngrGoIL-2, the vaccinated gooses reveal strengtheningimmune responses to AIV vaccine immunization. Thesedata suggested that rGoIL-2 had biological effects,though the effect on duck and chicken lymphocytes wasrelatively weak. These evidences mentioned above ledto sufficient support that functional similarity existedbetween goose and duck as well as chicken IL-2molecules. Furthermore, these results implied that therGoIL-2 was an important immunoregulatory moleculewell-studied in chicken and mammalian counterparts[30e33]. Similarly, an in vitro proliferation of chicken,duck and goose lymphocytes induced byChIL-2 aswell asDuIL-2 was similar to that of GoIL-2 (Fig. 6B and C).The result further demonstrated that the effect ofrGoIL-2, rChIL-2 and rDuIL-2 was dose dependentand certain species-specialties existed. Previous reportsshowed that there was certain species-characteristic333J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338334 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338Fig. 7. Neutralizing activity of anti-IL-2 Abs in goose IL-2 lymphocyte proliferation assay induced by rGoIL-2 and supernatant of 24 h Con A-stimulated goose SMC. Concentration of mAb 5B10 used was 30 ng/ml, and that of polyclonal antibody was 3 mg/ml. Non-immunized rabbit serumand mAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative controls. Cells without addition of any antibody were used as background control. Valuesare expressed as mean countsG standard error.between IL-2 from cells of various species [34e38]. Theproliferative response of human lymphocytes to recombi-nant porcine IL-2 was only 50% of that seen withrecombinant HuIL-2 [38]. Recombinant ovine IL-2 wasable to stimulate the proliferation of bovine lymphocytesbut not porcine lymphocytes. It was not surprising thatthere was 97% amino acid identity between the ovine andbovine proteins while the amino acid identity betweenovine and porcine IL-2 was 73%. Both ovine and bovineIL-2 amino acid residues involved in the binding to thehuman equivalents of the IL-2Ra (p55) and IL-2Rb (p75)subunits showed further that both these two domains ofthe ligand were entirely conserved [34,38]. Comparison ofthe ovine and porcine IL-2 amino acid sequences revealedthat six of the 25 residues involved in binding to the IL-2Ra (p55) were different. As for the IL-2Rb (p75) bindingdomain, five of the 10 amino acid residues were different.Hence, the amino acid residues in the two receptorbinding domains were less conserved between ovine andporcine IL-2 compared with the ovine and bovine IL-2[39].In our study, five mAbs specific for rGoIL-2were produced. Anti-GoIL-2 mAbs do not recognizerDuIL-2 and rChIL-2 proteins. While the E. coli-derivedrGoIL-2 could be recognized by mAbs 5H6 and 5F6to rDuIL-2, indicating that five anti-GoIL-2 mAbsrecognized a conserved epitope in the duck and chickenmolecules. And mAbs 5H6 and 5F6 to rDuIL-2recognized conserved epitopes in duck and goosemolecules. Furthermore, all mAb to E. coli-derivedGoIL-2 reacted specifically with EGFP-GoIL-2 proteinexpressed in vero cells, evincing that the five mAbsremained the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2.However, in neutralizing assay, only one of the five mAbs(mAb 5B10) was able to neutralize the activity of rGoIL-2and endogenous GoIL-2 in Con A-induced lymphocyteproliferation assay, indicating that only mAb 5B10 reactswith the functional domain of GoIL-2 protein.4.

Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338rabbit) were purchased from Laboratory Animal Centerof Zhejiang Academy of Medicine, Zhejiang, China. Alllaboratory animals and animal subjects used in thisstudy have been approved by the scientific ethicalcommittee of the Zhejiang University.4.2. RNA isolation, RT-PCR and sequencingGoose splenicmononuclear cells (SMC)were preparedas previously described by Zhou et al. [14]. SMCstimulated with Con A for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24,48 and 72 h were harvested, respectively. Total cellularmRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL,Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were designed according tothe conserved cDNA sequence for DuIL-2, ChIL-2 andTuIL-2 (GenBank accession no. AF294323, AF017645and AJ007463, respectively). Sense primer (5#-AATAC-TAGCACAGACAACCAG-3#) corresponded nt posi-tions 59e81. Antisense primer (5#-TTACTGAAAGAT-TTATTAAATATCATCTA-3#) was complementary tont positions 798e824. The cDNAs were synthesized fromtotal cellular RNA using the antisense primer. PCR wasconducted with sense and antisense primers under theconditions consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at95 \ufffdC for 1 min, primer annealing at 45 \ufffdC for 45 s andDNA extension at 72 \ufffdC for 2 min. The final DNAextension was carried out at 72 \ufffdC for 10 min. RT-PCRproducts were detected in 1% agarose gel. RT-PCRproduct was sequenced. The predicted amino acidsequence of GoIL-2 protein was compared with that ofavian and mammalian IL-2s from GenBank usingDNASTAR 5.0 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,WI, USA). Putative Signal peptide of GoIL-2 proteinwas determined using prediction servers at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/.4.3. Expression and purification of recombinantGoIL-2Based on the cDNA sequence of the above-men-tioned GoIL-2, the GoIL-2 ORF without the putativesignal peptide sequence was obtained by PCR using theupstream primer 5#-GCGAATTCGCACCTCTATCA-Table 2Goose anti-AIV (H9N2) HI antibody response induced by rGoIL-2Group AnimalNo.rGoIL-2 dose(ng/goose)Serum HI titer(log 2)a1stweek2ndweek3rdweek4thweekVaccine 10 250 0 5.2 5.6 6.610 300 0 6.3 6.7 7.710 350 0 6.4 6.9 8.210 ! 0 5.3 5.8 6.5Control 10 ! 0 0 0 0aHI titer was geometry mean titer.GAGAA-3# containing the EcoRI site and the down-stream primer 5#-GCAAGCTTTTATTTTAGCATA-GATCT-3# containing the HindIII site. Followingdigestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the PCR productwas subcloned into the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA) for expression as a His-tagged protein,named as pBAD-GoIL-2. The pBAD-GoIL-2 plasmidwas transformed into competent E. coli LMG194 cells(Invitrogen) and the transformants were screened on LBplates for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA fromresistant colonies was identified and sequenced todetermine the size and orientation of the insert. His-GoIL-2 expression was induced by the manufacturer\u2019sprotocols, and checked by SDS-PAGE as describedpreviously by Zhou et al. [40]. For the purification ofthe soluble recombinant His-GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2), thebacterial pellet was suspended in buffer B (100 mMNaH2PO4, 10 mM TriseCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0) and lysedthoroughly by sonication on ice. The lysate wascentrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at room tempera-ture (RT). Then the supernatant was collected andapplied to a nickel column (Qiagen) to purify histidine-tagged proteins according to the manufacturer\u2019s in-structions. The concentration of the purified rGoIL-2was determined spectroscopically at 595 nm using aprotein assay kit based on the Bradford reagent (Biorad,Hercules, CA). Western blot analysis of the expressedrGoIL-2 protein was checked as previously described byZhou et al. [40] with anti-X-press\ufffd mAb (Invitrogen),anti-human IL-2 mAb (Bender Medsystem Gmbh,Austria), and anti-DuIL-2 mAbs [26], anti-mouseIL-2 mAb (R&D systems Inc., U.S.A), anti-ChIL-2mAbs [41].To prepare native soluble His-GoIL-2 for prolifera-tion assay, the bacterial pellet was washed with PBS (pH7.2) for three times and resuspended in lysis buffer(50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mMimidazole) at 2e5 ml per gram wet weight with 0.01%Triton-X 100, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed entirelyunder 37 \ufffdC water bath and sonicated on ice for three30 s pulses with intervening 20 s pauses. The lysed cellswere centrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at 4 \ufffdC. TherGoIL-2 was purified under native conditions from theresulting supernatant by the above-mentioned nickelcolumn. The purified rGoIL-2 was dialyzed against PBS,concentrated using the PEG 6000. Polymixin B Sephar-ose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to remove LPSfrom the purified proteins. The bacterial protein fromE. coli LMG194 strain transformed with empty pBAD/His B vector were prepared and used as protein control.4.4. Production and characterization of monoclonaland polyclonal antibodies to GoIL-2MAbs specific for rGoIL-2 were obtained by immu-nizingmice with purified rGoIL-2 as described previouslywww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/http://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/336 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338[26,40]. Briefly, the spleen cells isolated from immunizedmice were fused with the sp2/0 myeloma cells by standardmethods. Hybridoma supernatants were screened forspecific binding to rGoIL-2 by the indirect ELISA asdescribed earlier [19], using 6!His, cell lysate of E. coliLMG194, rDuIL-2 [26], rChIL-2 [41] and rGoIL-2 asantigens. Hybridomas secreting mAbs to GoIL-2 wereisolated and cloned by limiting dilution for acitesproduction. The isotypes of the mAbs were determinedusing a commercial kit (Southern Biotechnology Asso-ciates, Inc., Birmingham, AL 35260, USA). Western blotanalysis of mAbs to rGoIL-2 was screened as the above-mentioned method.Anti-rGoIL-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) wasgenerated by bi-weekly immunization of NZW rabbitswith rGoIL-2-CFA emulsion (100 mg of rGoIL-2 perrabbit). Immunized rabbits were bled 14 days after lastinjection and the serum was collected.4.5. Preparation of endogenous GoIL-2 proteinThe suspensions of the goose SMC were prepared asthe method mentioned above. Goose SMC were dilutedto 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCSand 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5% CO2for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48,72 and 96 h. At each time point,the residual Con A was moved by incubating with 0.1 Ma-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,USA) for 30 min and the supernatant was harvested bycentrifugation at 10,000! g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC.4.6. Antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA for GoIL-2For quantification of rGoIL-2 expressed in E. coliand endogenous GoIL-2 in supernatants from Con A-stimulated SMC, an Ag-capture ELISA was developedwith certain modifications as described previously [20].Briefly mAbs and pAb to GoIL-2 were purified by fastprotein liquid chromatography (AmershamePharmaciaBiotech, Piscataway, NJ), and rGoIL-2 purified underdenaturing conditions was used as a reference protein.Ninety-six-well flat-bottom plates (NUNC, Denmark)were coated with mAb (10 mg/ml, 100 ml/well) to GoIL-2in 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 37 \ufffdC for 1 hfollowed at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Each well was blocked with200 ml PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at RT followedby three washes with 0.05 M PBST (PBS containing0.01% Tween 20). One hundred microlitres of culturesupernatant from Con A-stimulated SMC or proteinpreparations containing rGoIL-2 was added to each welland incubated for 4 h at RT. pAb to rGoIL-2 (100 ml/well) in PBSe0.1% BSA was added and incubated for1 h at RT after five washes. After incubation with HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & PerryLaboratories, Inc., Maryland, USA) for 30 min at RT.Peroxidase activity was detected by adding 100 ml/wellof o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml in 0.05 M PBS, pH5.0) substrate (Sigma) incubated for 15 min, and re-action was stopped by the addition of 50 ml of 2 Msulfate acid. Reactions were monitored by an automatedmicrotiter plate reader at 490 nm.4.7. Construction of eukaryotic expression vector,transfection and immunocytochemical stainingThe GoIL-2 ORF with the signal peptide sequencewas amplified by PCR using the upstream primer5#-GCGAATTCATGATGTGCAAAGTACTGATC3-#containing the EcoRI site and downstream primer5#-TTGGATCCTTTTTGCAGATATCTCAC-3# con-taining the BamHI site. The PCR product was subclonedinto the pEGFP-c2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech,Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. The resulting plasmid pEGFP-GoIL-2 was trans-fected into the vero cells which had been seeded into24-well plates (1! 105 cells/well) using a commerciallyavailable lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco). The cellswere examinedunder an inverted fluorescencemicroscope3 h post-transfection. Then the cells were fixed with 80%cold acetone at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. After washing three times withPBS, the cells were blocked for 1 h at 37 \ufffdCwith 5% skimmilk and 0.1%Triton-X 100 in PBST. The cells were thenincubated with the mAbs to rGoIL-2 diluted in PBSTcontaining 2% skim milk for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. Washed threetimes with PBST, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdCwith HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard &Perry Laboratories). Color development was carried outwith 9-aminoethyl carbazole (Sigma) and hydrogenperoxide in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Thecell expressed GoIL-2 was stained reddish-brown in thisassay.4.8. Bioassay and neutralizationLymphocyte proliferation induced by rGoIL-2 wasdetected by MTT test [42]. Briefly, SMC from thechickens, ducks and gooses were, respectively, sus-pended at 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640eFCS con-taining 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5%CO2 for 24 h. SMC stimulated by Con A for 24 h wereincubated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.1 Ma-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma) at 40 \ufffdC for 30 min.The cells were applied to Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) andlive cells were selected after centrifugation. The enrichedviable cell population was resuspended in RPMI-1640containing 10% FCS and cultured at 5! 106 cells/mlwith the supernatant containing endogenous GoIL-2 aswell as rGoIL-2 proteins in triplicates in 96-well micro-titer plates (100 ml/well, Costar, Corning, NY, USA).The cells containing RPMI-1640eFCS and proteincontrol from E. coli LMG194 strain transformed with337J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338pBAD/His B vector alone were used as negative controls.After incubation at 40 \ufffdC for 48 h, 20 ml MTT (5 mg/ml)was added to each well and reacted for 4 h. One hundredmicrolitres of lysis buffer (10% SDSe0.01 mol/l HCl)was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20 h at40 \ufffdC under 5% CO2 and OD value was measured at570 nm. ODGoIL-2/ODnegative value of 1.5 or above wasdefined as the positive criteria for the biological activityof rGoIL-2.Neutralizing capacity of mAbs and pAb to rGoIL-2was screened in 96-well plates as describedpreviouslywithmodifications [43]. Briefly, by fixing rGoIL-2 with anti-bodies in different concentrations, His-GoIL-2 (1.6 ng/well) and supernatant of Con A-stimulated goose SMC(100 ml/well) was mixed, respectively, with an equalvolume of serial 10-fold dilutions of mAbs or pAb andincubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. One hundred microlitres ofcells (5! 106 cells/ml) stimulated by ConA for 24 h wereadded to each well. Non-immunized rabbit serum andmAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negativecontrols. Cultures were incubated for 48 h at 40 \ufffdC andcell proliferation was measured as above. The percentneutralizing ability of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-bodies against rGoIL-2 was calculated with the formulaas described by Zhou et al. [27].4.9. Goose immunization and antibody detectionForty-five day-old Eastern Zhejiang white gooses weredivided into five groups, with 10 gooses per group. AfterGroup 1, Group 2 and Group 3 gooses were eachintramuscularly and, respectively, injected with a doseof 250 ng, 300 ng and 350 ng rGoIL-2, all gooses wereimmunized intramuscularly with the commercial inacti-vated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virusaccording to the manufacture\u2019s instruction at once [AIV(H9N2), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, ChineseAcademy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China].Gooses in Group 4 only were each intramuscularlyvaccinated with the inactivated AIV oil emulsion vaccine(H9N2), while gooses in the 5th Group were eachintramuscularly immunized with the oil adjuvant asa control. Under the same feeding condition, bloodsamples were collected via wing vein puncture at 1, 2, 3and 4 weeks after immunization. The hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) antibody titer against AIV was measuredby the HI assay according to the manufacture\u2019s in-struction (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, ChineseAcademy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China).AcknowledgementsThis work was funded by Zhejiang Provincial NatureScience Foundation of China (Grant No. R303145) andNational Natural Science Foundation of China (GrantNo. 30230270).
