Previously, we reported a marked increase in Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activity in human dermal psoriaticfibroblasts. As retinoic acid (RA) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and a mechanism for its beneficial effects is notunderstood, we investigated the effects of RA on SOD mRNA and protein expression levels in human normal and psoriaticfibroblasts. Prior to RA exposure, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were similar in normal compared to psoriatic fibroblastswhile Mn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were increased in psoriatic cells. However, in contrast to normal fibroblasts, exposure ofpsoriatic fibroblasts to 1 mM RA down-regulated Mn-SOD mRNA, and also decreased Mn-SOD activity by w80% with no changein Mn-SOD protein levels. In contrast, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and enzymatic activity were modestly reduced by RA treatment in bothnormal and psoriatic fibroblasts. Furthermore, RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD steady-state mRNA levels. These results indicate that RA can serve as a regulatory agent to down-regulate the steady-state levels of bothMn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in psoriatic cells. These findings offer a new model for the antiinflammatory activity of RA when used inthe treatment of psoriasis.\ufffd 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionStudies to define the role of superoxide radicals (O2c\ufffd)in both physiological and pathological processes are anarea of active investigation. Reactive oxygen species(ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxideradicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated in cells inresponse to stimulation by various hormones, growthfactors and cytokines [1], such as PDGF [2,3]. Themailto:raynaud@vjf.cnrs.frhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/0896841170 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78oxygen radicals generated appear to act as secondmessengers in transmembrane signaling pathways andmodulate cellular functions such as cell proliferation,differentiation, and apoptosis [3]. Oxidative regulationof several key enzymes involved in cellular signaltransduction, including protein kinases, has been de-scribed [4].Oxidants also have been implicated in a number ofpathological disorders, including Alzheimer disease,psoriasis, aging, atherosclerosis, and cancer [5e8]. Theprimary cellular defenses against damage that can becaused by O2c\ufffd and by its reactive progeny are thesuperoxide dismutases (SODs). Mammalian cells havea mitochondrial Mn-SOD, a cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD(also found in peroxysomes) and an extracellular SODwhich is a Cu,Zn-SOD that is immunologically distinctfrom the classical Cu,Zn-SOD [9]. These metalloen-zymes act to dismute toxic superoxide radicals to oxygenand H2O2[9e11]. Catalase, along with peroxidases suchas glutathione peroxide, in turn catalyze the decompo-sition of H2O2 to water and oxygen. Studies have beenongoing for a number of years in our laboratories on thesynergism between retinoic acid and cyclic AMP thatregulates cell growth and differentiation [12]. In thecourse of these studies, it was established that cyclicAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity, as wellas 8-azido-[32P] cAMP binding to the RI and RIIregulatory subunits, are decreased in cells of psoriaticpatients compared to cells of normal subjects [13]. Morerecent studies determined that exposure of normalhuman dermal fibroblasts to H2O2 and to other oxygenfree radical generating systems decreased both PKAactivity and cyclic AMP binding to RI and RII, to levelssimilar to those observed with psoriatic fibroblasts [14].Treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts with free radicalscavenging agents restored the ability of RI and RII tobind cyclic AMP toward normal levels. We also showedthat SOD activity, particularly that of the mitochondrialenzyme, Mn-SOD, was elevated in fibroblasts preparedfrom a psoriatic patient [15]. These results suggestedthat oxidative modification may serve as a mechanism toalter PKA in human cells, and that an altered oxidativestate may be responsible for the decrease in PKAactivity and cyclic AMP binding in cells from psoriaticpatients.Retinoic acid derivatives have been used with somesuccess in the therapeutic treatment of psoriasis eventhough the mechanism of retinoid action responsible forthis beneficial effect was not known [16,17]. Previously,we established that the treatment of psoriatic fibroblastswith retinoic acid and with other retinoids, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid and arotinoid induced an increase in theoxidatively modified PKA activity back towards normallevels [13]. Again however, the mechanism by whichretinoic acid acted to increase PKA activity in psoriaticcells remained to be elucidated. Thus, the present studieswere carried out to determine if retinoic acid treatmentmight differentially regulate antioxidant enzyme activi-ties in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts. To address thisquestion Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activi-ties, as well as Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA levelsand protein levels, were determined in cells in thepresence and absence of retinoic acid. Retinoid treat-ment of psoriatic fibroblasts was observed to signifi-cantly decrease both Mn-SOD activity and steady-statemRNA levels as well as both Cu,Zn-SOD expressionand enzymatic activity.2. Materials and methods2.1. Experimental reagentsRetinoic acid (RA) and actinomycin D (ActD) wereobtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MI, USA) andcycloheximide was purchased from Calbiochem (LaJolla, CA, USA). ActD was dissolved in dimethylsulf-oxide (Me2SO). RA was dissolved in 100% ethanol andcycloheximide in double distilled water (ddH2O).DMEM with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, fetalbovine serum and antibiotics were obtained fromInvitrogen. The antibody to b-actin was an anti-mousemonoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. The rabbitanti-human Mn-SOD antibody and the goat anti-human Cu,Zn-SOD antibody were gifts of DrN. Taniguchi, Osaka, Japan. The horseradish peroxi-dase-labelled secondary antibody was obtained fromJackson Immunoresearch. Protein assay reagents andpolyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchasedfrom Bio-Rad (Marnes la Coquette, France).2.2. CellsHuman fibroblasts were isolated from seven normaland seven untreated adult psoriatic patients (Psoriasisvulgaris in flare for approximately 3 months) byenzymatic digestion of small pieces (4 mm) of lesionaland non-lesional buttock and abdominal skin punchbiopsies as previously described [14,18]. These Caucasiansubjects were age- and sex-matched. This study wasapproved by the ethical committee of the Ho\u0302pital Cochin(Paris). The patients had received no systemic therapysuch as corticosteroids, antimitotic drugs, retinoids forat least a year before the study; no systemic anti-inflammatory drugs for at least two weeks before thebiopsy; no local corticosteroids, ultraviolet light, or oralpsoralen for at least three months before the assay. Theseverity of the disease was determined by mean psoriaticarea and severity index (PASI)score, as described byFrederiksson and Peterssonn [45]. The PASI score forthe 10 patients were 22.54G0.47 (Range 12.8e34.1).Cells were grown as previously described [14] and used71P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78subconfluent (106cells/dish) at the fifth passage. All datawere obtained with cells propagated for the same numberof passages (fifth passage) under identical cultureconditions. For each donor the different assays wereperformed on the same cell extracts prepared from cellsarising from the same cell seeding.2.3. Preparation of cellular fractionsFibroblasts were washed three times with ice coldphosphate buffered saline and harvested by scrapinginto ice cold buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2,20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with a cell scraper with anti-proteolytics. The cells were recovered by centrifugationat 1000g for 5 min and the cell pellet was then frozen at\ufffd80 \ufffdC. For antioxidant enzyme activity measurements,the control and psoriatic cell pellets were disrupted bysonication in 500 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,pH 7, (whole cell lysates), and the same cellular samplewas used to assay each of the indicated activities withinthe same experiment.2.4. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activitiesAs previously described [15], xanthineexanthineoxidase was used to generate an O2c\ufffd flux and thereduction of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5 phe-nyltetrazolium chloride (INT) to red formazan by O2c\ufffdwas followed at 505 nm, 30 \ufffdC. Each assay tubecontained 50 mM (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-sul-fonic acid) (CAPS) buffer, pH 10.2, for determination ofCu,Zn-SOD activity [19], or 50 mM phosphate buffer,pH 7.8, for determination of total SOD activity [20],along with 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM INT, 50 mM xanthine,1 U/ml catalase, 0.05 mM bathocuproin disulfonatedisodium salt (BCS), 0.13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin(BSA), and enough xanthine oxidase to achieve therequired 100% of non-inhibition. BCS and BSA wereadded to inhibit non-enzymatic scavenging of O2c\ufffd. Mn-SOD activity was determined by adding cyanide (2 mM)to the assay mixture at pH 7.8 to inhibit Cu,Zn-SODactivity, or was determined by subtracting the Cu,Zn-SOD activity determined at pH 10.2 from the total SODactivity measured at pH 7.8. The two methods gavesimilar values (data not shown). All data are expressedin units of SOD activity per mg of protein.2.5. Western blot analysisCell pellets were prepared as described above. Thencell lysates were prepared, protein levels were de-termined and the lysates were then heated for 5 min at95 \ufffdC in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed byelectrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels (10 mg/sample). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellu-lose and Western blots were performed as described inthe Supersignal kit (Pierce, Bezons, France). The SODproteins were detected with a rabbit anti-human Mn-SOD antibody and a goat anti-human Cu,Zn-SODantibody, both diluted 1000-fold (gift of Dr TaniguchiN., Osaka, Japan).2.6. Actinomycin D treatmentTo determine the stability of Cu,Zn- and Mn-SODmRNA, with or without retinoic acid (1 mM), the threedifferent types (normal, non-lesional and lesionalpsoriatic) of human fibroblast primary cultures wereuntreated or treated for 48 h with 1 mM RA, and then10 mg/ml ActD was added. Cells were collected, andtotal RNA was isolated at the indicated time points.2.7. Cycloheximide treatmentTo inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with10 mg/ml cycloheximide, with or without retinoic acidtreatment (1 mM) for 48 h. To determine the turn over ofCu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein, cells were collected fromthe three different types of human fibroblasts primarycultures at the indicated time for western blot analysis.2.8. RNA isolation and real time RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted with RNA-Plus (Qbiogene,Illkirch, France) from normal (N, Normal Skin),lesional (LP, Lesional Psoriatic Skin) and non-lesional(nLP, non-Lesional Psoriatic Skin) cultured fibroblasts,and 1 mg of each sample was reverse-transcribed intocDNA using a first-strand cDNA-synthesis kit (Amer-sham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted with theTaqMan system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) forthe Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady state mRNAlevels with or without RA treatment or the LightCyclersystem for the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNAstability (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)using the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green for thedetection of PCR products according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed ina total volume of 20 ml in the presence of 2 ml of cDNA,2 ml of 10! LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I,1.25 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of both primers. After de-naturation at 95 \ufffdC for 10 min, the samples underwent40 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 \ufffdC; 5 s at 60 \ufffdC and8 s at 72 \ufffdC). Sense and antisense primers were re-spectively: 5#-GGC GAC CTG GAA GTC CAA CT-3#and 5#-CCA TCA GCA CCA CAG CCT TC-3# for PO;5#-CTG AAG GCC TGC ATG GAT TC-3# and 5#-CCA AGT CTC CAA CAT GCC TCT C-3# for Cu,Zn-SOD; 5#-CGT GAC TTT GGT TCC TTT GAC A-3#and 5#-AAG TGT CCC CGT TCC TTA TTG A-3# forMn-SOD. Experiments were performed with duplicates72 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78for each point, and all results were normalized to P0(RPLP0, human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein)cDNA detected in the same sample.2.9. Analysis of statistical significanceData were analysed by the ANOVA test.3. Results3.1. Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblastsdecreased SOD enzymatic activitiesIn agreement with our previous findings [15], bothnon-lesional (nLP) and lesional (LP) psoriatic fibroblastsexhibit significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD andCu,Zn-SOD activities compared to normal (N) fibro-blasts (Table 1). Treatment with 1 mM RA for 4 daysdecreased the Cu,Zn-SOD activity determined in allthree cell types by 18% ( p! 0.005), 26% ( p! 0.005),and 23% ( p! 0.025) for normal, nLP, and LPfibroblasts, respectively. Interestingly, the Mn-SODactivity was dramatically decreased by 1 mM RAtreatment for 4 days in psoriatic fibroblasts and returnedto levels equivalent to that in normal firbroblasts (83%and 78% decrease in nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts,respectively, p! 0.005), whereas RA had no effect onMn-SOD activity in normal fibroblasts (Table 1).3.2. Time dependency of decreased SOD enzymaticactivities upon retinoic acid treatmentThe effects of treating cells with RA for increasingperiods of time on Cu,Zn-SOD (panel A) and Mn-SOD(panel B) activities are depicted in Fig. 1. RA treatmentof nLP, LP and normal fibroblasts showed only a slighteffect on Cu,Zn-SOD activity through 3 h. However,a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD activity was observed in allthree cell types at 96 h of treatment with RA, which wasmaximal at 18 h (Fig. 1A). Importantly, RA had littleeffect on the low basal level Mn-SOD activity present innormal fibroblasts through 96 h of treatment, whiletreatment of both nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts withRA for 3 h resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mn-SODactivity (Fig. 1B). This decrease in Mn-SOD activity inresponse to RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts wasmaintained through 96 h. At this time, the Mn-SODactivity of psoriatic cells was similar to its basal leveldetermined in normal fibroblasts.3.3. Retinoic acid effects on Cu,Zn-SODand Mn-SOD protein levelsThe protein levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SODpresent in control and RA-treated cells were analysed bywestern blot and densitometric scanning of the auto-radiographs (Fig. 2). Exposure to RA was found toreduce the level of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in both normaland psoriatic fibroblasts from 18 h through 96 h oftreatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no alteration in thelevel of Mn-SOD protein was observed in any of the celltypes through 96 h of treatment with RA (Fig. 2B).In another set of experiments, cells were treated for18 h and 96 h. While the Mn-SOD protein level was notchanged by RA treatment of either normal or psoriaticfibroblasts (Fig. 2D), RA treatment did result indecreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in all threedifferent human primary cell types (nZ 4 of eachprimary cultures, Fig. 2C). Thus, in comparison withuntreated cells, the mean valuesG SEM of Cu,Zn-SODprotein levels were decreased by 17%G 4 ( p! 0.02),19%G 2 ( p! 0.05) and 27%G 8 ( p! 0.03) in nor-mal, nLP and LP RA-treated cells, respectively.3.4. Analysis of Mn-SOD steady-state mRNA levelsNext, the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA levels inall three primary cell types were determined using realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionTable 1Down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities by retinoic acid in cultured fibroblasts isolated from skin of normal subjects and fromlesional and non-lesional psoriatic patientsSOD activitiesFibroblasts Treatment Mn-SOD (mU/mg prot) Cu,Zn-SOD (mU/mg prot)Normal 0 72.3G 5.3 (59e102) 231.9G 16.0 (180e306)(nZ 7) RA 96 h 74.7G 6.1 (57e104) 191.9G 8.4 (159e222)Non-Lesional Psoriatic 0 233.7G 22.3 (143e300) 364.4G 22.0 (293e443.5)(nZ 7) RA 96 h 38.8G 4.8 (29e61) 270.0G 26.6 (192e338.5)Lesional Psoriatic 0 267.0G 19.7 (220e320) 363.6G 26.4 (275e452)(nZ 7) RA 96 h 57.6G 9.7 (40e82) 279.7G 6.9 (260e300)Data are expressed as the meanG SEM of triplicate determinations carried out with 7 primary cultures of Normal, non-Lesional Psoriatic, andLesional Psoriatic human fibroblasts with and without treatment by 1 mM RA for 4 days.

Normalization of theresults were obtained by establishing the ratio of Mn-SOD/P0 and Cu,Zn-SOD/P0 [21]. The steady-state levelof Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not statistically different inpsoriatic fibroblasts obtained from non-lesional (nLP,nZ 4, meanGSEM, 4.85 AUG 1.34) and lesional skin(LP, nZ 5, meanGSEM, 3.56 AUG 0.57) compared tonormal fibroblasts (N, nZ 4, meanGSEM,4.22 AUG 0.44) (Fig. 3A, open bars).

Effects of retinoic acid treatment onCu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady-statemRNA levelsGiven our finding that psoriatic fibroblasts hadsignificantly higher levels of Mn-SOD mRNA, we nextdetermined the effects of RA on both Cu,Zn-SOD andMn-SOD mRNA. As determined by real time RT-PCR,the steady-state levels of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA found inpsoriatic cells were significantly decreased in response toRA treatment for 96 h (nLP 0Z 4.85 AUG 1.339, nLPRAZ 3.07 AUG 0.21, p! 0.03 nZ 4; LP 0Z 3.56AUG 0.57, LP RAZ 2.52 AUG 0.44, p! 0.015nZ 5; N 0Z 4.22 AUG 0.44, N RAZ 3.27G 0.85nZ 4).

DiscussionThe involvement of oxygen free radicals in a growinglist of diseases indicates a need for pharmaceutical agentsthat may inhibit the production of free radicals. Thesemolecules may enhance radical scavenging systems,which may then reverse oxidative damage to importantcellular components including those of the signal trans-duction pathways. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), theactive metabolite of vitamin A, is critical in theregulation of a number of biological processes, includingembryogenesis and cell growth [22,23] and it also hasbeen used in the treatment of psoriasis [24]. Previousresults, which demonstrated that RA treatment of cellscould reverse the oxidatively modified state of proteinkinase C [25], and of PKA [14], indicated that RA mightact to alter redox activities within the cell. However, itsmechanism of action is still unclear. To assess the role ofRA as an important regulator for treatment of psoriasis,we have investigated the effects of RA on Cu,Zn-SODand Mn-SOD activity as well as mRNA and proteinlevels in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts.Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic (nLP andLP) fibroblasts produced a significant, time-dependentdecrease in Mn-SOD activity and mRNA to the basallevels observed in normal fibroblasts. As increased Mn-SOD activity occurs in response to an oxidative stressand particularly in response to superoxide anions, theantioxidant effects of RA treatment results in a reductionof Mn-SOD activity in the psoriatic cells to basal levels.Interestingly, the amount of Mn-SOD protein found inthese cells was not modified by RA treatment. However,discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels havealso been reported by others. Ahlemeyer et al. [26]showed that staurosporine did not influence the mRNAlevels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD, but decreased theprotein levels and the activity of both enzymes incultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. Tsan et al. [27]76 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78showed that hyperoxia-induced increase in the mRNAlevel of Mn-SOD in the lung was not associated with anincrease in the protein level or enzymatic activity of Mn-SOD. Niu et al. [28] found an induction of the Mn-SODmRNA by lipopolysaccharides in rat astrocytes, witha constant Mn-SOD protein level. These observationssuggest that SOD protein levels could be dissociatedfrom their synthesis and from their enzyme activities.The fact that RA decreases mRNA levels of Mn-SOD inpsoriatic fibroblasts without a significant decrease inprotein levels could be explained by the stability of theseenzymes in time course of our experiments. Our resultsare in agreement with a 5e6 h half-life for Mn-SOD[29]. It is also possible that the RA treatment has alteredthe subcellular distribution of the protein. For example,if the RA treatment enhanced protein transport into thelysozome or proteosome through post-translationalmodifications such as ubiqutination, it is possible thatwhile total cellular protein levels were not changed, theenzymatic activity was reduced due to the change insubcellular localization. This hypothesis awaits furtherinvestigation.Enzyme activities often are modulated by post-translational modification of the protein. Covalentmodifications such as disulfide formation, phosphoryla-tion, acetylation, glycosylation and nitration all havebeen reported [30]. An additional modification termedretinoylation also has been observed in cells treated withretinoic acid [31,32]. Following activation of retinoicacid in a coenzyme A-mediated reaction, a thioesterbond between protein and RA can be created. The RIand RII regulatory subunits of PKA were found to beretinoylated in HL 60 cells [32], and we also observedretinoylation of RI and RII in normal and psoriaticfibroblasts [33]. Retinoylation of the RII regulatorysubunit, as well as total protein retinoylation, wasobserved to be increased in psoriatic cells. This raises thepossibility that Mn-SOD could be covalently modifiedby retinoylation in response to RA treatment ofpsoriatic cells, thus explaining our observed decreasein enzyme activity. Finally we recently have shown anincrease of carbonylation in psoriatic cells, which couldalso be responsible for protein modification and de-creased enzyme activity [34].Retinoic acid treatment had a differential effect onthe modulation of Cu,Zn-SOD. The basal level ofCu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not significantly altered inpsoriatic as compared to normal fibroblasts, whereasthe basal Mn-SOD mRNA level was significantlyelevated in psoriatic fibroblasts. In studies withpsoriatic epidermis, Lo\u0308ntz et al. [35] reported that theexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was unchanged inpsoriatic (nLP and LP) compared to normal skin. Inour case, we have determined that retinoic acidtreatment resulted in decreased levels of Cu,Zn-SODmRNA in psoriatic cells. However, the mechanism(s)underlying the down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD expres-sion remains unclear. In fact, there is little informationconcerning factors which may regulate Cu,Zn-SODtranscription, as Cu,Zn-SOD is constitutively expressedin primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts, and is notregulated by cytokines and growth factors [36]. Re-cently, Frank et al. [37] showed a direct coupling ofCu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression levels to the presenceof nitric oxide, since Cu,Zn-SOD levels declined duringacute inflammation (endotoxemic shock) in the pres-ence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS and withoutinvolvement of the soluble guanylate cyclase. Thissuggested the possibility that under conditions ofchronic inflammation, such as in psoriatic fibroblasts,Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression might be regulated byH2O2, NO and peroxinitrite.Results presented here showed that RA treatment ofpsoriatic fibroblasts for 18 h down-regulated Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA steady-state levels. These results suggesteither transcriptional regulation or a modification ofmRNA stability of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression withRA treatment of psoriatic cells, but a translationalregulation of Cu,Zn-SOD levels in normal cells.Retinoids appear to exert their biological effects throughmultiple gene regulatory nuclear factors [38e40]. Anactivated retinoidereceptor complex can regulate geneexpression by two distinct mechanisms. It can activatetranscription by binding to a retinoid response elementin the promoter of specific genes. However, no retinoidresponse element was found within the promoter regionsof the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD genes. Alternatively,RA can indirectly repress the activity of other nucleartranscription factors such as AP-1 [41,42]. The activatedretinoid receptor complex can interact with cofactorproteins that are required for AP-1 mediated genetranscription factor. However, no binding sequence forthe AP-1 transcription factor has been found within theproximal promoter of Cu,Zn-SOD. Thus, RA regula-tion of Cu,Zn-SOD gene expression may requireinteraction with other cellular components, such asother cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs,see for review Noy [43]). The possible involvement ofCRABPs in mediating this down-regulatory effect of RAon Cu,Zn-SOD expression is of interest in view of thefinding that CRABP II levels are elevated in psoriaticskin [44] and awaits further analysis. While in this reportwe studied the effect of RA on psoriatic fibroblasts, asan immunologic sentinel. RA has other cellular targetsin psoriasis such as keratinocytes and T lymphocytes.Thus it is quite possible that Cu,Zn-SOD could also beinvolved in the prevention of T-cell apoptosis [46]. Thishypothesis awaits further testing.In conclusion, RA treatment of primary psoriaticfibroblasts resulted in a significant decrease in theelevated level of Mn-SOD activity found in these cellsat a level similar to that in normal fibroblasts. This77P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78regulatory effect of RA could be at the level of proteincovalent modification or subcellular localization or atthe Mn-SOD mRNA steady-state level, since there wasno significant change in total cellular Mn-SOD proteinlevels. Retinoic acid treatment of both normal andpsoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD activity that appeared to be at the level oftranscriptional regulation. Thus our data begins toprovide a biochemical basis for the use of RA in thetreatment of psoriasis.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Dr Isabelle Gorin from theDepartment of Dermatology, Ho\u0302pital Tarnier (Paris)for her kind clinical assistance.
