These proteins, together with cyclophilin B(encoded by PPIB), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the a1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis/transisomerase (PPIase) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 isnot required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disruptprotein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. P3H1 and CRTAPstabilize each other and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hence, hypomorphic or loss of functionmutations of either gene cause loss of the whole complex and its associated functions. The relative contribution of losingthis complex\u2019s 3-hydroxylation versus PPIase and collagen chaperone activities to the phenotype of recessive OI isunknown. To distinguish between these functions, we generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution inthe catalytic site of P3h1 (Lepre1H662A). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex withCrtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of thea1(I) and a1(II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal inappearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bonemass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growthphenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissueconsequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.Citation: Homan EP, Lietman C, Grafe I, Lennington J, Morello R, et al.

Amutation in cartilage associated protein (CRTAP) (*605497) wasfirst identified by Morello et. al. in a class of patients with recessiveOI [2]. CRTAP functions in a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase1 (P3H1) (*610339) and cyclophilin B (CYPB) (*123841) to 3-hydroxylate a unique proline, Pro986, of the a1(I) chain and alsoto chaperone collagen trimer assembly [3\u20135]. Additionally, otherclade A fibrillar collagens, such as collagen type II, are similarlyhydroxylated. Subsequently, mutations in both leucine and prolineenriched proteoglycan (LEPRE1), encoding P3H1, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase b (PPIB), encoding CYPB, were identified inother patients with recessive forms of OI [6\u201313]. Mutations inadditional genes have since been identified in recessive OI,revealing novel mechanisms of disease through alterations in post-translational collagen modification, trafficking and signaling.Knockout mice have been created for each of the three genesthat encode the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex and these micerecapitulate the phenotype observed in recessive OI patients.Crtap2/2and Lepre12/2mice display osteochondrodysplasia,severe low bone mass, kyphosis, rhizomelia and collagen fibrilswith irregular diameter [2,14]. Although the Ppib2/2mice do notPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121have rhizomelia, they also have a low bone mass phenotype withkyphosis and wider collagen fibrils [15]. Together, these findingshighlighted the importance of this complex in collagen modifica-tion and maintenance of bone mass.Since null mutations in either LEPRE1 or CRTAP can result inrecessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) with almostidentical features, P3H1 and CRTAP were hypothesized tostabilize each other [16]. Indeed, western blot and immunofluo-rescence studies demonstrated absence of both CRTAP and P3H1in fibroblasts isolated from patients carrying either LEPRE1 orCRTAP mutations alone [16,17]. These data supported the notionthat CRTAP and P3H1 proteins stabilize each other in theendoplasmic reticulum.The present study aimed to determine the relative contributionof the hydroxylation activity of the P3H1 complex to thepathogenesis of recessive OI. This important question wasaddressed in vitro and in vivo by introducing a point mutation inthe catalytic domain of P3H1 that inactivated hydroxylase activitywhile preserving the protein secondary structure and the CRTAP/P3H1/CypB complex integrity.ResultsDetermining amino acids important for the hydroxylasefunction of P3H1To accomplish our goal of inactivating the hydroxylase functionof P3H1, we employed an evolutionary trace algorithm to identifyconserved residues that are essential for its enzymatic function.The four top ranking residues identified were the catalytic triadresidues (HIS590, HIS662, and ASP592) and the 2-oxoglutaratebinding residue (ARG672) (Figure 1A). The importance of theseresidues for hydroxylase activity was confirmed by earlierliterature [18,19]. Conversion of the catalytic triad histidines oraspartic acid to either alanine or glutamate abolished theenzymatic activity of Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in A. thaliana[20]. Similarly, conversion of the 2-oxoglutarate binding arginineto alanine also abolished the hydroxylase activity, suggesting thatsubstituting the corresponding sites in P3H1 with an alanine couldpotentially inactivate its hydroxylase function [20]. Since alanine isa non-bulky, uncharged amino acid that can mimic the secondarystructure of many other amino acids, we opted for this substitutionrather than a glutamate substitution to preserve the structuralintegrity of P3H1.Rescue of CRTAP stability by mutant P3H1 in cell cultureSince the stability of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex isdependent on the interaction of P3H1 and CRTAP, it wasimportant to verify that the mutation introduced into LEPRE1 didnot disrupt its ability to form a stable complex with CRTAP andCYPB. To do this we first used an in vitro approach. We usedimmortalized patient fibroblasts carrying a loss of functionmutation in LEPRE1 and tested whether the expression of 4different LEPRE1 constructs containing alanine substitutions atH590, D592, H662, or R672 were able to restore the stability ofCRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. Wefound that the mutant expression construct converting H662 toalanine (P3H1H662A) was the most effective at rescuing CRTAPcompared with the others or the un-transduced LEPRE1 loss offunction cells (figure 1B, C). These findings are consistent withP3H1H662Abeing able to interact with CRTAP and to restore it tothe ER. Although P3H1H662Awas not assayed for enzymaticactivity, mutating the corresponding residue to an alanine in Prolyl4-hydroxylase in A. thaliana resulted in complete inactivation of thehydroxylase activity, suggesting the P3H1H662Amutant is likely tobe inactive [20].Demonstration that Lepre1H662A/H662A knock-in mice lackPro986 collagen hydroxylationWe generated knock-in mice carrying the H662A mutation atthe Lepre1 locus (Lepre1H662A/H662A) (figure S1). Importantly, weverified that CRTAP is also restored in vivo in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice compared with wild-type littermates by confirming itspresence by western blot using protein isolated from P1 calvaria(figure 2A). Since the Pro986 residue of a1(I), a1(II) and a2(V)procollagen chains is normally fully hydroxylated and completeloss of the P3H1 complex abolishes hydroxylation at these sites[2,14,15,17], we analyzed the hydroxylation status of theseresidues in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice to assess the in vivoenzymatic activity of P3H1H662A. Tandem mass spectrometryshowed loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation (3-Hyp) at Pro986 in thea1(I) chain and a residual 21% 3-Hyp in the a2(V) chain frombone (figure 2B, 3). Pro978 of the bone a2(V) chain remainedminimally 4-hydroxylated, similar to the level observed in wild-type littermate bone (figure 3). This is in contrast to Crtap2/2mice in which 3-Hyp at Pro986 was missing but in effect replacedby 4-Hyp at Pro978 apparently as a consequence of over-modification in comparison to wild-type mice [17]. In cartilage,tandem mass spectrometry showed specifically a residual 9% 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the a1(II) chain of the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice(figure 2C), which is comparable to the 6% 3-Hyp observed inCrtap2/2mice (not shown). These findings are summarized inTable 1 together with the hydroxylation status of other partiallyoccupied 3-Hyp sites in bone and cartilage collagens. The loss of 3-Hyp appears to be specific to Pro986 of types I, II and V collagenssimilar to findings in mouse models with complete loss of the P3H1complex [2,14,15,17].Effects on lysine hydroxylation and cross-linkingCollagen cross-linking in bone was studied by determining theratio of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline to lysyl pyridinoline (HP/LP).Author SummaryThe prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex serves to hydroxylate asingle residue in type I collagen and also serves as acollagen chaperone. The complex is comprised of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, cartilage associated protein, and cyclophilinB. Mutations have been identified in the genes encodingthe complex members in patients with recessive Osteo-genesis Imperfecta. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen does not alter the stability ofcollagen but may rather mediate protein-protein interac-tions. Additionally, the collagen chaperoning function ofthe complex is an important rate limiting step in themodification of type I collagen. Irrespective of whetherpatients with mutations in the genes encoding themembers of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex havehypomorphic or complete loss of function alleles, eithercircumstance leads to the loss of both functions of theprolyl 3-hydroxylase complex. Thus, it is unknown howcollagen chaperoning and/or hydroxylation affect boneand cartilage homeostasis. In this study, we generated amouse model lacking the prolyl 3-hydroxylation activity ofthe complex while maintaining the chaperoning function.We found that the hydroxylase mutant mice have normalcartilage and normal cortical bone but decreased trabec-ular bone, suggesting that there is a differential require-ment for hydroxylation in different tissues.Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121Figure 1. Residues important for hydroxylase function and catalytic mutations rescue the stability of CRTAP. Evolutionary traceanalysis identified residues important for the function of P3H1 by comparing each residue within the dioxygenase domain family. The highest rankingresidues are mapped onto the dioxygenase domain responsible for prolyl 3-hydroxylation (A). These residues include 3 that interact with iron (His590,Asp592, and His662) shown in red and 1 that interacts with 2-oxoglutarate (Arg672) shown in yellow. An alanine substitution was introduced atHIS662 (H662A) to deactivate the hydroxylase function. To test whether the mutant P3H1 was able to rescue the stability of CRTAP, we transducedEffects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121This ratio reflects the hydroxylation status of those triple-helicallysines at K87 and K930 in a1(I) and/or K87 and K933 in a2(I)that had participated in cross-link formation. In the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice, there was an increase in the HP/LP ratio compared towild-type littermates indicating that there may have been anoverall increase in hydroxylation at one or both of these sites.However, mass spectral analysis of linear (uncross-linked) sequenc-es from the same helical cross-linking sites prepared by digestionimmortalized LEPRE1 loss of function fibroblasts with WT or H662A mutant LEPRE1 cDNA and assayed for the presence of CRTAP byimmunofluorescence and immunoblot. Here we demonstrate that the stability of CRTAP is rescued by immunofluorescence (B) and by immunoblot(C).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g001Figure 2. Loss of Prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 in type I collagen in bone and type II collagen in cartilage. Upon generation of theLepre1H662A/H662Amice, we confirmed the stability of both P3H1 and CRTAP by western blot using protein isolated from mouse calvaria (A,experiments repeated 3 times). Comparing protein isolated from the Lepre1H662A/H662Aand the Lepre1+/+mice, we found no differences in the levels ofP3H1 and CRTAP when compared to c-Tubulin. Analysis of prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 on the a(1) chain of type I collagen in bone using massspectrometry demonstrates complete loss of 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice when compared to Lepre1+/+ littermates (B). Similarly,analysis of the Pro986 site on the a1 chain of type II collagen in cartilage demonstrates a reduction to 9% 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice and is similar to what was reported in Crtap2/2mice (C).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g002Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121either with bacterial collagenase or trypsin showed no significantdifferences between Lepre1H662A/H662Aand wild-type bone colla-gen. Residue a1(I) K930 was 98% hydroxylated and nonglycosylated in both genotypes and a1(I)K87 was 92% hydroxyl-ated in wild-type and 93% in Lepre1H662A/H662A. So the differencein HP/LP ratio may be due to altered hydroxylation at thehomologous sites in the a2(I) chain but we did not acquireinformative peptides from the latter. Informative peptides fromnon cross-linking lysine sites also showed no significant differencesbetween wild-type and Lepre1H662A/H662Abone. For example, a1(1)K174 was essentially all galactosyl Hyl in both genotypes and a2(1)K219 was 70% hydroxylated in wild-type and 77% in Lepre1H662A/H662A. Thus, no evidence of generalized over-modification wasfound from these site-specific mass spectral results.The content of HP+LP in the bone collagen was notsignificantly altered (Table 2). Consistent with the latterobservation, Lepre1H662A/H662Amice showed no significant differ-ence in the ratio of telopeptide hydroxylysine to lysine in theextracted bone collagen a1(I) chains when compared to their wild-type littermates based on the mass spectral ratio of Hyl to LysFigure 3.

Mass spectral analysis of Pro986 hydroxylation in tryptic peptidesfrom the a2(V) chain of bone from Lepre1+/+and Lepre1H662A/H662Amice (A and B respectively) shows a marked reduction in hydroxylation at this site.The MS/MS fragmentation patterns shown in C and D identified the 765.82+peptide and its 3-hydroxylated version 773.92+. A portion (40%) of thelatter ion was also found by MS/MS to be contributed by a version lacking 3-Hyp but containing 4-Hyp at P978 (taken into account in the 3-Hypquantitation).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g003Table 1.

Radiographs at 3 months and 6 months of age showednormal skeletal patterning and no evidence of skeletal deformitysuch as kyphoscoliosis (figure 4A, not shown). Previous studiesof the Crtap2/2and Lepre12/2mice showed a disorganization ofthe growth plate causing smaller body size with shortening of theproximal long bone segments (rhizomelia) [2,14]. To assessgrowth, the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice and their wild-type littermateswere weighed weekly until 3 months of age. At all time points, theweight of Lepre1H662A/H662Amice was not statistically different fromthat of wild-type littermates (figure 4B). Similarly, there were nosignificant differences between the lengths of the femur, tibia, northe femur/tibia ratio, thus excluding any rhizomelic defect in theLepre1H662A/H662Amice [2,14] (figure 4C).Since the Lepre12/2mice have a dysplasia of the growth platethat also affects the hypertrophic chondrocytes, we performedhistology and specific staining of the hypertrophic zone with anantibody directed towards type X collagen in Lepre1H662A/H662Amice at P1 [14]. No defects were observed in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice compared to their wild-type littermates (figure 5A, B;figure S2A, B). Additionally, we observed no difference in thewidth of the hypertrophic zone between the two genotypes (N = 8,p-value = NS) (figure 5C; figure S2C). Collectively, the normalgrowth curve, normal femur to tibia ratio and normal hypertro-phic zone suggest that the cartilage in the long bones ofLepre1H662A/H662Amice is indeed normal despite of loss ofPro986 hydroxylation in type II collagen.By assessing the femurs and spines at 3 months of age (n = 10,each genotype) by micro-computed tomography, we found thatthe Lepre1H662A/H662Amice had cortical bone mineral density andcortical thickness values comparable to wild-type littermates(figure 6). In addition, while the biomechanical analysis offemurs by 3-point bending test (n = 7, each genotype) demonstrat-ed no differences in the extrinsic biomechanical properties(ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and post-yield displace-ment), the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, wasincreased and the elastic modulus, an intrinsic material property,was decreased in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice compared towild-type littermates (figure 6). Moreover, the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice have less trabecular bone when compared to wild-typelittermates, which is quantified by decreased bone volume overtissue volume (BV/TV), decreased trabecular number (Tb.N),decreased trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and increased trabecularseparation (Tb.Sp) (figure 6). These findings are partly in contrastto what was described for Lepre12/2mice, which are characterizedby a decrease in both trabecular and cortical bone mineral density[14], and cortical stiffness and force to failure of femurs [14].To further study the trabecular bone phenotype in theLepre1H662A/H662Amice, bone histomorphometric analysis wasconducted on 3-month spines (n = 9). A statistically significantdecrease in bone volume over tissue volume and trabecularthickness confirmed the low bone mass phenotype (figure 7) [2].However, no differences in the osteoblast number (N.Ob/BS),osteoclast surface over bone surface (Oc.S/BS), osteoid parameters(osteoid volume over bone volume and osteoid surface over bonesurface) or bone formation rate were observed between the twogenotypes (figure 7).Collagen fibril ultrastructure, secretion rate, and steady-state levelsThe morphology of collagen fibrils was then analyzed at theultrastructural level in skin biopsies from Lepre1H662A/H662Amice.The electron micrographs showed collagen fibrils that were morehomogeneous in diameter compared to wild-type controls(figure 8). This suggested that collagen trimers may not beefficiently assembled into higher order collagen fibrils as reflectedby an increase in the proportion of smaller diameter collagenfibrils in the Lepre1H662A/H662Askin (N = 3, 150 collagen diametersmeasured per animal, p,0.05) (figure 8).We then analyzed the collagen secretion rate, as measured bypulse-chase assays in dermal fibroblasts. The rate and amount ofprocollagen secreted from the Lepre1H662A/H662Afibroblasts wereapparently similar to those secreted by wild-type fibroblasts(repeated 3 times) (figure 9A, B). These findings contrast withthe delayed procollagen secretion observed in the Lepre12/2miceand are apparently different from the increase in the collagensecretion rate observed in the Crtap2/2fibroblasts (figure 9A, B)[2,14]. We also assessed whether there was collagen overmodifica-tion by steady-state analysis. The electrophoretic migration of typeI collagen chains synthesized by wild-type and Lepre1H662A/H662Afibroblasts was similar and suggested normal post-translationalmodification (repeated 3 times) (figure 9C). These findings differfrom the overmodification observed in collagen isolated fromCrtap2/2fibroblasts [2]. These findings support a conclusion thatthe catalytically inactive P3H1H662Amutant protein can restorethe chaperone activity and collagen assembly function of the P3H1complex in the ER.DiscussionWe generated and characterized a novel mouse model(Lepre1H662A/H662A) that harbors a knock-in mutation in thecatalytic domain of P3H1. This mutation inactivated the 3-hydroxylase activity of P3H1 and caused loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986in the collagen a1(I) chain of bone and a reduction to 9% 3-Hyp atPro986 in the a1(II) chain of cartilage. Our findings are similar towhat has been reported in the null mouse mutants for thecomponents of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex [2,14,15].Additionally, our data confirm the findings by Pokidysheva et. al.that the Pro986 site in the a1(I) chain of bone is exclusivelyhydroxylated by P3H1 [21]. The hydroxylation status of the A3(Pro707) site of the a2(I) chain is similar between the wild-type andTable 2.

Thepercentage hydroxylation of a1(I) chain N- and C- telopeptides from massspectrometry appeared not to be affected (N = 1, both genotypes, p = NS).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.t002Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121Lepre1H662A/H662Abone (although the wild-type percentage that weobserved is lower than that observed by Pokidysheva et. al. andcould be attributable to strain differences) and is in contrast to thereduction observed at this site in the Lepre12/2bone [21]. Theexpression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) was found to be dramat-ically reduced in the bone of Lepre12/2mice, possibly explainingthe reduction in hydroxylation observed at the A3 site [21].Pokidysheva et. al. also noted a slight increase in the expressionlevel of Leprel2 (encoding P3H3), which could account for theresidual hydroxylation observed in the Lepre12/2mice [21].Additionally, since the hydroxylation status of the A3 site isolatedfrom bone of Lepre1H662A/H662Amice is similar to their wild-typelittermates, it supports the notion that another P3H is responsiblefor hydroxylation at this site. The hydroxylation status of Pro986Figure 4. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice are normal in gross morphology.

With highexpression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) in pre-hypertrophicchondrocytes and Leprel2 (encoding P3H3) in the resting/proliferating chondrocytes (not shown), it is possible that the 9%residual hydroxylation of Pro986 in a1(II) in cartilage could be aresult of hydroxylation by P3H3 (or P3H2) analogous to thesituation in bone with a2(V). Alternatively, it is possible that thehistidine to alanine substitution at residue 662 may not completelyinactivate the prolyl 3-hydroxylase function of P3H1 although wethink this is less likely given published biochemical analysis of thisresidue and the lack of hydroxylation in bone [20].The Lepre1H662A/H662Amice have reduced trabecular bone, butnormal cortical bone and normal extrinsic cortical biomechanics.Figure 5. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have a normal femoral hypertrophic zone. Since the Lepre12/2 animals showed disorganization of thehypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1) of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice by H&E staining (A) and by specifically marking the hypertrophiczone using an antibody directed against type6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the femur of the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice are indistinguishablefrom their wild-type littermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of the hypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in thewidth between genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g005Figure 6. Micro-Computed Tomography and cortical biomechanical analyses. 3D reconstruction of spines from the Lepre1H662A/H662A micecompared to wild-type littermates. The Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have less trabecular bone as quantified by reduced bone volume (BV/TV), reducedtrabecular number (Tb.N), reduced trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), reduced trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), and increased trabecular separation(Tb.Sp). Cortical parameters are similar to wild-type, as quantified by normal cortical BMD or stiffness and force to failure. These results suggest thatthe Lepre1H662A/H662Amice have normal cortical bone but reduced trabecular bone. (N = 10, each genotype).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g006Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 9 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121Although the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, isincreased in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice, this finding could be acompensatory mechanism to maintain similar extrinsic propertiesdespite inferior intrinsic properties. Due to physiological higherremodeling rates in trabecular bone, a mild effect is more likely tomanifest earlier in trabecular bone than in cortical bone, and thiscould account for the differential phenotype observed in our mice.The mild effect could also account for our histomorphometry datawhere we observe no difference in osteoid and bone formationparameters and is in contrast to the lower osteoid parameters andbone formation rate observed in the Crtap2/2mice [2]. Thus, dueto a mild effect, we cannot detect a difference in the osteoid andthe dynamic indices of bone formation.Additionally, cartilage is normal in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amicesuggesting that 3-Hyp modification in type II collagen is notrequired at least in the resting/proliferative zone. Table 3compares the bone phenotypes exhibited by Crtap2/2, Ppib2/2,Leprel12/2and Lepre1H662A/H662Amice. The pronounced growthdefects and disorganized growth plates in the mice lacking afunctional P3H1 complex may reflect a particular sensitivity ofgrowth plate chondrocytes to ER stress caused by handlingmisfolded un-partnered subunits of the complex.The effect of 3-hydroxyproline on collagen stability is not clear.Studies originally suggested the absence of a triple-helix structurefor synthetic peptides containing 3-hydroxyproline at all Xaapositions [22,23]. Recent studies indicate the presence of one ortwo 3-hydroxyprolines in the Xaa position does produce a triplehelix with a consequent slight increase in stability [3,24,25]. Thesedata suggest that although the absence of 3-hydroxyproline maynot affect the stability of the triple-helix it may alter protein-protein interactions [24]. Since matrix-cell signaling is importantin the development and maintenance of connective tissues, it isplausible that collagen post-translational modifications like prolyl3-hydroxylation could specify protein-protein interactions betweencollagen and other ECM components. Furthermore, theseinteractions may be context-dependent differing in trabecularFigure 7. Histomorphometry of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice. By histomorphometry, we were able to confirm the low trabecular bone massphenotype in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice as quantified by decreased bone volume (BV/TV) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th). We observed nodifferences in osteoblast and osteoclast parameters, as measured by the number of osteoblasts (N.Ob/BS) and osteoclast surface (OcS/BS). Weobserved no difference in the kinetic indices of bone formation, as measured by mineral apposition (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS) and boneformation rate (BFR/TV) and in osteoid parameters, as measured by osteoid volume (OV/BV) and osteoid surface (OS/BS) (mean 6 SD, N = 9, bothgenotypes).doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g007Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 10 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121bone vs. cortical bone vs. cartilage. Candidates include ligandinteraction sites mapped to the fibril in proximity to Pro986 andinclude fibronectin and a1b1/a2b1/a1b11 integrins [26].Mutations that result in loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylationcomplex can result in collagen overmodification [27]. This couldalso independently affect collagen fibril interaction sites, e.g., withsmall leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) such as decorin. Suchdisruption or other signaling effects could explain the disorgani-zation of the hypertrophic zone observed in the Lepre12/2micebut not observed in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice. Future workinvestigating the signaling defects present in bone and cartilagewill be necessary to understand the chondrodysplasia present inpatients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.Compared with other tissues, the extracellular matrix of bone isunique in the sense that it is able to mineralize [28]. As thedominant component of bone, it is likely that type I collagen playsan important role in the manner of mineralization of theextracellular matrix. It has been argued that the collagen of bonehas evolved special features that equip it to constrain the growthinternally of nanocrystal plates of hydroxyapatite [27]. Extra-fibrillar non-collagenous proteins limit the amount of extrafibrillarcrystal growth [27].Evolutionarily, prolyl 4-hydroxylation increases the thermalstability of the triple helix through hydrogen bonding [29].Although loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a feature of recessivelyinherited OI, the evolutionary function of 3-hydroxyproline is stillpoorly characterized. One clue to the potential role of 3-hydroxyproline in collagen is through the identification of partiallyoccupied 3-Hyp sites in type I and II collagen; these are D-periodically spaced and suggest the modification is involved insome aspect of collagen fibril assembly [30]. Peptide studiessuggest that the 3-Hyp residues have selective affinity for oneanother [30]. Additionally, the 3-hydroxyl groups are outwardpointing from the triple-helix, which provides evidence that short-range hydrogen bonding between collagen triple helices is likely tooccur [30]. Although 3-Hyp appears early in collagen evolution,the 3-Hyp at Pro986 of the alpha I chain of type I collagenappeared much later [27,31]. In fact, the presence of 3-Hyp at thisresidue coincides with the appearance of CRTAP and occurs justbefore the appearance of vertebrates and bone [32]. Takentogether, with the potential role of 3-Hyp and the appearance of 3-Hyp at Pro986 just prior to the appearance of vertebrates andbone, we speculate that this unique modification could havefunctioned to equip collagen molecules for a polymeric architec-ture that allows organized hydroxyapatite nanocrystal growthwithin fibrils potentially explaining the lack of phenotype incartilage vs. bone in our Lepre1H662A/H662Amice.In addition to the loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986, we observed anincrease in the HP/LP ratio in the bone of the Lepre1H662A/H662Amice compared to their wild-type littermates. In both dominantand recessive OI, there is an increase in the HP/LP ratio,supporting alterations in collagen crosslinking [33]. The increasein HP/LP ratio suggests a disturbance of the fibrillar architecturein bone and could result in the disorientation of nanocrystal platesof hydroxyapatite, but does not signify overmodification of thecollagen. Since we observe no difference in collagen migrationfrom the steady-state collagen analysis, we conclude that there isno gross overmodification in the collagen isolated from theLepre1H662A/H662Amice. Additionally, we observe no difference incollagen secretion, providing indirect evidence that the P3H1complex is able to form and bind to collagen, in contrast to theLepre12/2mice which have a delay in collagen secretion due tofailure of complex formation [14].Future work investigating the contribution of signaling vs.collagen cross-linking defects present in bone and cartilage will benecessary to understand the generalized connective tissue pheno-type present in patients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.Materials and MethodsEthics statementAll research involving animals was conducted according to therelevant national and international guidelines.

All mouse workwas approved by the Center for Comparative Medicine inconjunction with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-mittee.Evolutionary TraceThe Evolutionary Trace (ET) is an approach to identifymolecular determinants of protein function and to targetmutational analysis and protein engineering to the most relevantamino acids of a protein [34\u201338]. To help identify functionallyimportant sites, ET builds a phylogenetic tree from a multiplesequence alignment and then scans the multiple sequenceFigure 8. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have smaller collagen fibrildiameter. Transmission EM analysis of collagen fibrils from skinrevealed fibrils more homogenous in size in the Lepre1H662A/H662Amiceas compared to the wild-type littermates. Additionally, the collagenfibril diameters are slightly smaller, as quantified by a slight increase inthe proportion of smaller diameter collagen fibrils.

Lepre1H662A/H662A fibroblast procollagen secretion rate and collagen modification is normal. Analysis of procollagen secretionby the collagen pulse-chase assay suggests that the procollagen secreted from Lepre1H662A/H662Afibroblasts is similar to Lepre1+/+fibroblasts (A, B).Additionally, there does not appear to be a decrease in the amount of procollagen secreted from the Lepre1H662A/H662Afibroblasts in comparison toLepre1+/+ fibroblasts (A, B). These findings are in contrast to that of the Crtap2/2 fibroblasts, which have an increase in the rate of procollagensecretion (A). Collagen modification was assessed using the collagen steady-state assay. We observed no difference in the migration pattern ofprocollagen and collagen isolated from Lepre1+/+(+/+) and Lepre1H662A/H662A (H662A/H662A) fibroblasts (C). These assays were repeated three times.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g009Effects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121Harvest of cells for protein analysisAfter fibroblasts were cultured to confluence in a 60 mm2dish,cells were washed in 16PBS. Subsequently, cells were scraped in1 ml 16 PBS and transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Cellswere spun down at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at roomtemperature. Samples were resuspended with 50 ml of 5%B-MEand Lamellae loading buffer (Biorad) prior to the separation ofproteins on a polyacrylamide gel.Immunodetection by immunoblot10 mg of protein was loaded into each well, run and transferredto a PVDF membrane using a standard wet transfer process. Afterblocking using 5% milk or 5% BSA, proteins were detected usingthe following antibodies directed against P3H1, CRTAP, and c-Tubulin (sigma) diluted in appropriate buffer. The blot waswashed 3 times, 10 minutes each with 16 TBS with 0.05%Tween20 and then incubated with the corresponding secondaryantibody and washed again. Proteins were visualized using theLuminato Crescendo HRP substrate (Millipore) by incubating blotwith the substrate for 2 minutes before exposing the blot to filmand feeding it through the developer.ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were split into glass LAB-TEK 4-well chamber slides(Nunc), and 24 hours later were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% donkey serumand 1% BSA, and then sequentially incubated with 1:250 dilutionof CRTAP antisera or P3H1, 1:500 donkey anti-rabbit secondaryantibody conjugated to Alexa Flour 594 (Invitrogen), and mountedwith Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Theslides were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.RecombineeringRecombineering was utilized to generate the P3H1 knock-inmouse model using the method described by Pentao Liu [40].Briefly, retrieval vector and targeting constructs were designed andcloned together in order to retrieve the section of Lepre1 for genetargeting and for introducing the alanine substitution into the genelocus. The linearized DNA construct was electroporated into AB2.2embryonic stem (ES) cells and screened for positive recombinationevents by both Southern blot and sequencing. Germ-line transmis-sion of the mutant allele into C57BL6 was obtained.Animal tissue collection and processingLepre1H662A/H662Amice and wild-type littermates were sacrificedat 3 months of age. Spine, femurs and skin were dissected, fixed,paraffin embedded, and sectioned according to standard methodsas previously described [2]. The Lepre1H662A/H662Amouse colonywas maintained in a mixed 129Sv/ev-C57Black/6J geneticbackground and housed in the Baylor College of MedicineAnimal Vivarium.Radiographs, bone histology/histomorphometry, andtissue stainingStandard protocols were followed for the following stains:Hematoxylin and Eosin. Immunofluorescence on mouse tissueswas done as previously described [41]. Briefly, the paraffin sectionswere xylene treated, rehydrated, and heated for 20 minutes in asteamer for antigen retrieval. Subsequently they were incubated inblocking solution (3% normal Donkey serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.1%Triton X-100 in PBS), 1:100 dilution of COLX antisera, 1:600donkey ant-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa flour594 (Invitrogen), and finally mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fadereagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). At the end of each describedprocedure, images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2microscope. Radiographs were obtained by Kubtec XPERT80(Kubtec X-ray, Milford, CT). Routine histologic analysis ofparaffin-embedded long bone and growth plates was done as perstandard protocols. Histomorphometric analysis of static anddynamic parameters (using 25 mg/kg calcein injection) of boneresorption, formation, and volume was carried out according tostandard procedure in 12 week-old (N = 6 each sex and genotype)[42] and analyzed using the Bioquant OsteoMetrics softwaresystem (BIOQUANT Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville,TN).Micro-CT analysisSpine and femur samples were placed into a 16 mm tube filledwith 70% ethanol and scanned at 16 micron resolution using aScanCo uct40 scanner (N = 10 each sex and genotype). Trabecularand cortical analysis was performed using the ScanCo software.The trabecular region of the L4 vertebrae was manually selected(contoured) every 5 slices, and then the remaining slices weremorphed to enclose the region of interest, for a total of 100 slices.The region was thresholded at 210 with a gauss setting of 0.Cortical analysis was performed on 50 slices of the femoralmidshaft, using the same thresholding.Three-point bending analysisFemurs were collected (N = 7, both genotypes) during tissueharvest, wrapped in gauze soaked in 16PBS and stored at 220uCuntil ready for analysis. All testing was performed in a 3-pointTable 3.

The posterior surface of the femurwas placed on the lower supports and centered between the twosupports. The displacement rate used for the analysis was0.3425 mm/sec.Stress was calculated using the following formula:Stress~(0:5h)FL4Iwhere F is the load applied on the femur in N, L is the span lengthin mm, h is the specimen diameter in mm, and I is the cross-sectional moment of inertia in mm4. L was set at 7 mm for thethree point bending jig. Both h and I were obtained by analyzing amidshaft micro-CT image using the slice geometry program inBoneJ, a plugin for bone image analysis in ImageJ. The programidentified the bone in the grayscale micro-CT image by pixelbrightness and then calculated its cross-sectional parameters oncean accurate scale was assigned.Strain was calculated using the following formula:Strain~6DhL2where D is the actuator displacement in mm, h is the diameter inmm and L is the span length in mm.To determine the Yield Point, a region was identified after thepreload and before the maximum load on the Load-Displacementcurve. This region was separated into 2 segments from which thefitted line of the segment with greatest slope was taken. Next, a0.00876 mm offset was implemented on the line. The point ofintersection between the offset line and the Load-Displacementcurve was the Offset Yield Point. This yield point corresponded toa 0.2% offset strain, which is commonly chosen in the literature.The elastic region was identified as the region from the completionof the preload to the Yield Point. Post-Yield region was identifiedas the region from the Yield Point until the Failure Point, wherethe load dropped to zero. Elastic Displacement was thedisplacement during which specimen remained in elastic region.Post-Yield Displacement was the displacement during whichspecimen remained in the Post-Yield region. Total Displacementwas calculated as the sum of Elastic Displacement and Post-YieldDisplacement. Using a trapezoidal numerical integration method,Elastic Energy was calculated as the area under the elastic regionof the Load-Displacement curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Energy wascalculated as the area under the post-yield region of the Load-Displacement curve. Energy to Failure was the sum of ElasticEnergy and Post-Yield Energy. Maximum Load was determinedby finding the highest load value recorded by BLUEHILL, beforethe specimen failed. To calculate Stiffness, Least Square fit methodwas applied to the steepest segment of the elastic region of theLoad-Displacement curve. Stiffness was the slope of least square fitline.Ultimate Strength was determined by finding the highest Stressvalue before the specimen failed. Using a trapezoidal numericalintegration method, Elastic Toughness was calculated as the areaunder the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Toughness was calculated as the area under the post-yieldregion of the Stress-Strain curve. Toughness to Failure was thesum of Elastic Toughness and Post-Yield Toughness. To calculateElastic Modulus, Least Square fit method was applied to thesteepest segment of the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve.Elastic Modulus was the slope of least square fit line.Electron microscopyFreshly dissected tissues were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/1.5% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% tannic acid in 0.1 MCacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 for 60 minutes on ice, rinsed in 0.1M cacocylate overnight, then postfixed for 60 minutes incacodylate buffered 1% OsO4, rinsed, then dehydrated in agraded ethanol series from 30\u2013100%. The samples were washed inpropylene oxide and embedded in Spurrs epoxy. Ultrathinsections were stained in Uranyl Acetate followed by Reynoldslead citrate and examined using a FEI Tecnai G2 TEM.Transmission electron microscopy was performed on skin of wild-type and Lepre1H662A/H662Amice (N = 3). The fibril diameter of tenfibrils in each of fifteen different areas per mouse was measured(N = 150 total measurements).Collagen cross-link and mass spectral analysesPyridinoline cross-links (HP and LP) were quantified by HPLCafter hydrolyzing demineralized bone in 6N HCl as described[44].Types I and V collagens were prepared from minced bonedecalcified at 4uC in 0.1M HCl overnight. Type I a-chains wereextracted by heat denaturation (90uC) in SDS-PAGE samplebuffer. Type V collagen was solubilized by pepsin in 3% aceticacid and selectively precipitated by 1.8 m NaCl [45]. Type IIcollagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion of rib cartilage in 70%formic acid [46]. Collagen a-chains and CNBr-peptides wereresolved respectively on 6% and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels [47].Demineralized bone matrix was digested with bacterial colla-genase as described [48]. Collagenase-generated peptides wereseparated by reversed-phase HPLC (C8, Brownlee Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm625 cm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile:n-propanol (3:1 v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid [49].Individual fractions were analyzed by LC-MS.Collagen a-chains or CB peptide bands were cut from SDS-PAGE gels and digested with trypsin in-gel [50]. Peptides wereanalyzed by electrospray LC/MS using an LCQ Deca XP ion-trapmass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with in-line liquidchromatography using a C8 capillary column (300 um6150 mm;Grace Vydac 208MS5.315) eluted at 4.5 ul min. The LC mobilephase consisted of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) andbuffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3:1 acetonitrile:n-propanol v/v). Anelectrospray ionization source (ESI) introduced the LC samplestream into the mass spectrometer with a spray voltage of 3 kV.Sequest search software (ThermoFinnigan) was used for peptideidentification using the NCBI protein database. Large collagenouspeptides not found by Sequest had to be identified manually bycalculating the possible ms/ms ions and matching these to the actualms/ms. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine calculations were donemanually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutesso that all of the post-translational variations of a given peptideappeared together in the full scan.Fibroblast isolation from miceMice were euthanized using isoflurane, the fur was scraped offthe back of the mouse and a small section of skin was harvested.The skin was washed with 16PBS and placed dermis down onto awell of a 6-well plate. 2 ml of DMEM complete was added to thewell and the skin was cut into small pieces using a scalpel to allowfibroblasts to migrate from the skin.Collagen secretion from fibroblastsWe analyzed procollagen secretion by pulse-chase assay aspreviously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated 2.56105 cells ontoEffects of P3H1 on Bone and CartilagePLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight. The next evening, themedium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mM ascorbateto induce collagen synthesis. After washing the cells 3 times with16PBS to remove FBS from the cells, the medium was replacedwith serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCiof L-[2,3,4,5-3H] proline. Cells were labeled for 1 hour and thenchased with fresh medium containing unlabeled proline. Both thecell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16inhibitor at 20-minute intervals and the procollagen was precip-itated with collagen carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Sampleswere electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing ureaunder reducing conditions, dried, and imaged by exposing film togel for 24 hours at 280uC and processed using a developer.Procollagen secretion over time was measured by comparing theamount of labeled procollagen present in the cell layer andmedium at each time point. The pulse-chase assay was repeatedthree times to confirm the results.Collagen steady-state analysisWe analyzed collagen modification by collagen steady-stateanalysis as previously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated2.56105 cells onto a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight.The medium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mMascorbate to induce collagen synthesis. After 4 hours, the cellswere washed 3 times with 16PBS and the medium was replacedwith serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCiof L-[2,3,4,5-3H] proline. Cells were labeled overnight. Both thecell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16inhibitor and the procollagen was precipitated with collagencarrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Collagens were obtained byovernight pepsin digestion (50 ug/ml) of procollagen samples.Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containingurea under reducing conditions for collagen samples, dried, andimaged by exposing film to gel for 24 hours at 280uC andprocessed using a developer. This assay was repeated three timesto confirm the results.Statistical analysesData are expressed as mean values 6 standard deviation (SD).Statistical significance was computed using the Student\u2019s t test. A Pvalue ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Generation of Lepre1H662Amutant allele. A recombi-neering strategy was utilized to incorporate the H662A mutationinto the Lepre1 gene locus. Positive recombination events wereanalyzed by Southern blot using XmnI to differentiate thegenomic locus allele from the targeted (Lepre1H662A) allele.(TIFF)Figure S2 Lepre1H662A/H662Amice have a normal tibial hyper-trophic zone. Since the Lepre12/2animals showed disorganizationof the hypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1)of Lepre1H662A/H662Amice by H&E staining (A) and by specificallymarking the hypertrophic zone using an antibody directed againsttype6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the tibia of theLepre1H662A/H662Amice are indistinguishable from their wild-typelittermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of thehypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in the widthbetween genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes).(TIFF)AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Catherine Ambrose and the Biomechanics lab atthe University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX for their helpperforming the 3-point bending analysis.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: EPH JL RM DN DE BHLL.Performed the experiments: EPH CL IG MMJ EMM BD TKB YC RL JHMAW.
