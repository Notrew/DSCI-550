The inhibitory effect was reverted by PI3K inhibitors. The sub-G1phase cells after ellipticine treatment appeared at the expense of those that accumulated first at S- andG2/M phases during the early stage of treatment. We showed that the progression leading to cell deathwas impaired by wortmannin, which reverted apoptosis by retaining cells at S- and G2/M transition statesThe characteristic apoptosis marker p53 activation after treatment appeared first followed by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) fragmentation. They disappeared upon co-treatment with wortmannin andthe apoptotic phenotype reversed. Furthermore, ellipticine regulated endogenous survival signaling byup-regulating phosphorylated Akt that returned to its basal level later. Furthermore, ellipticine inducednucleus translocalization of p53 and Akt and recruitment of autophagosomes. The autophagic-related celldeath was interfered by wortmannin and the suppressed growth reverted. The Akt-related cell death alsooccurred in p53-deficient cells with stable expression of exogenous p53. The work showed that ellipticine-CTEDinduced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was achieved through autophagy and apoptotic death as a result ofAkt-modulation. Being a topoisomerase II inhibitor, ellipticine proved a regulator in autophagy-relatedation1ttOmaamirmpdc[atatptrsthtq(t0dAcell death through corpor. IntroductionEllipticine (5,11-dimethyl-6H-pyrido[4,3-b]carbazole), one ofhe naturally occurring alkaloids, was isolated from the leaves ofhe evergreen tree Ochrosia elliptica Labill (Apocynaceae) found inceania. The drug and its analogues are known to inhibit topoiso-erase II activity in human cancer cells. Ellipticine analogues arective against brain tumor cell lines [1] and proved potent againstpanel of cancer cells [2]. The drug was promising in treatingetastatic breast cancer and brain tumors [3]. The anticancer activ-ties of ellipticine and its derivatives, such as 9-methoxyellipticine,etelliptine, ellipticiniums, 9-hydroxyellipticine and 9-chloro-2-ethylellipticinium have also been reported effective against aanel of cancer cell lines [3\u20139]. Although ellipticine and theirRETRerivatives are known capable of intercalating DNA, generatingytotoxic free radicals and uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation10\u201312], its efficacy in human lung cancer cells and the associatedction mechanisms were not completely understood.\u2217 Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.The ellipticine-mediated cytotoxicity is mediated by inhibitingopoisomerase II activity [13]. The strategy is commonly used asn effective anticancer strategy. In this work, we further describedhat the proliferation of human NSCLC cells A549 can be sup-ressed by ellipticine and the inclusion of PI3K inhibitors blockedhe inhibitory effects. Being a topoisomerase II inhibitor, the drugestrained proliferation by arresting cells at S- and G2/M transitiontates prior to induction of sub-G1 cell populations. The ini-ial drug-mediated phosphorylation of Akt-serine473 (Akt-Ser473)elped in maintaining cell viabilities at the initial stage of drugreatment. However, the induced up-regulated p53 and the subse-uent Akt dephosphorylation lead to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerasePARP) fragmentation and final apoptosis. Further analysis revealedhat ellipticine caused nucleus translocation of both p53 andhosphorylated Akt as well as the development of autophagicells. The effects were attenuated by wortmannin, which blockedhe apoptotic phenotype. The work demonstrated that ellip-icine induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells by modulating signalingathway and subcellular redistribution of Akt and p53. Thus,I3K-regulated autophagic cell development by controlling cellrowth provided a new dimension for topoisomerase II inhibitor,llipticine.http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002http://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcanmailto:biofv033@scc.ntnu.edu.twmailto:kangfang@ntnu.edu.twdx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.05.0262 ancer22iAGliAcIdeD2vMd9cmi(rtw2siwt5bpfiMommm2tttDwpfocmattem2wbapatwnbp(wpLwE2ciP0b1t(twa33wim(l3(l51afta3A28 K.

Cell lines and monolayer growth determination of NSCLC cellsn cultureHuman lung cell carcinoma cell lines H322, H1437, H1299 and549 were acquired from ATCC and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen,rands Islands, NY). All cultured cells were supplemented with-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with 7% heat-nactivated FCS in the humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u25e6C.ll cell lines were examined and found to be free of mycoplasmaontamination using a MycoTect kit (Invitrogen, Grandsslands, NY).The H1299 cells transfected with cytomegalovirus promoter-riven pcDNA-p53 consisting of full-length wild-type p53 werestablished previously and maintained in serum-supplementedMEM [14]..2. MTT assay determination for proliferation rate and celliability evaluationThe effect of cell proliferation by ellipticine (Sigma, St. Louis,O) was measured by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-iphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were plated in6-well culture plates (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well). After 24 h incubation, theells were treated with different concentrations of ellipticine. Fiftyicroliters of MTT test solution was added to each well. After 4 hncubation, the absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate readerMultiskan EX, Labsystems) at a test wavelength of 492 nm and aeference wavelength of 690 nm. The viability of untreated cells inhe presence of diluted vehicle control was regarded as 100%. Theorks were conducted in three different experiments..3. Flow cytometry of cell cycle analysis by propidium iodidetainingTo determine phase distribution of DNA content, propidiumodide (PI) staining was performed. Briefly, 3 \u00d7 105 cells collectedere washed once and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After cen-rifugation at 700 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, cell pellet was stained with\ufffdg/ml PI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) plus 0.5 mg/ml RNaseA in PBSuffer for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The analysis waserformed with FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mans-eld, MA). Cell cycle distributions were analyzed by Cell-Quest andodfit software (Becton-Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). The statisticsf cell distributions were calculated from three individual experi-ents.To test the inhibitory effect, the cells were treated with wort-annin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h prior to addition of freshedia and ellipticine of specified concentrations..4. Green fluorescent protein-tagged light-chain 3 plasmidransfectionA549 cells were grown on sterile histologic slides, and, after 24 hhe cells, were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-agged light-chain 3 (LC3) plasmid (a gift from Dr. Wei-Pang Huang,epartment of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Tai-an) using a mixture of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and GFP-LC3lasmid in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 5 \ufffdl Lipo-RETRectAMINE per milliliter of medium per 1 \ufffdl plasmid. After 6 hf incubation, cells were placed in regular complete medium andultured for 1 day. After cells were treated with ellipticine and wort-annin or vehicle control for 2 days, the medium was changed,nd cells were further incubated for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. The slides weresrC63 (2009) 227\u2013234hen washed with PBS, and cells fixed in cold methanol. Cells werehen washed in PBS twice, and coverslips were mounted with glyc-rol/PBS (3:1) solution. Slides were examined under a fluorescenticroscope (Leica)..5. Western blot analysisCells cultured in 0.5% serum-supplemented media were treatedith ellipticine were washed with PBS and scraped in lysateuffer containing 1% triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1%protonin, 5 mM PMSF and 10 \ufffdg/ml leupeptin in 20 mM sodiumhosphate. Protein concentration was determined by the BCAssay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 20 \ufffdg of total pro-ein was performed for Western blots analysis. Protein samplesere electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred toitrocellulose filters). The blots were then incubated in freshlocking solution and probed for 1 h with 1:3000 dilution of53, pAkt-Ser473, Akt, GSK3\ufffd, pGSK3\ufffd-Ser21 and PARP antibodiesCell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), respectively. Blots wereashed twice in PBS-T and then incubated with a 1:4000 dilution oferoxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Kirkegaard and Perryaboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in PBS-T for 1 h at 22 \u25e6C. Blotsere again washed twice for 10 min in PBS-T and then detected byCL illumination system (Amersham)..6. Immunofluorescence analysisThe cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in PBSontaining 3.7% formaldehyde. The fixed coverslips were washedn PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed twice inBS (5 min), and incubated in a blocking buffer (PBS containing.2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. The cells were then incu-ated in the blocking buffer containing the primary antibody forh and washed three times in PBS (5 min) before incubation withhe appropriate TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody plus DAPIMolecular Probes Inc.) for further 30 min. The cells were washedhree times in PBS (5 min) and washed in water. The stained cellsere mounted on glass slides and examined for fluorescence underfluorescent microscope (Leica).. Results.1. Growth inhibition induced by ellipticine was neutralized byortmanninTo evaluate the effects of ellipticine on cell growth, the viabilitiesn human lung cancer cells with various p53 genotypes were deter-ined. Compared to H322 (p53 mutant p53 (R248L)) and H1437mutant p53 (R267P)), cell viabilities of ellipticine-treated epithe-ial NSCLC cells A549 (wild-typed p53) were reduced to less than0% with increased concentrations of the drug using MTT assayFig. 1A). Compared with cells treated with vehicle control alone,ess than 50% of the cells were left after 48 h after treating with\ufffdM ellipticine. The viable cells were further reduced to less than0% after 96 h. The induced growth inhibition in A549 cells wasbrogated progressively by increasing wortmannin concentrationsrom 100 to 200 nM and by LY294002. Similar to vehicle control,reatment with wortmannin alone exerted no effect on cell growtht all in culture (Fig. 1B)..2.

After48 h of treatment, 50 \ufffdl of MTT solution were added into the cells.

Cells of sub-G1 phase appeared 3 days later; whilehose at G2/M phase decreased simultaneously. As wortmanninoncentrations were increased from 100 to 200 nM, cells at sub-1 state disappeared proportionally and most of them remainedt S- and G2/M check points. The results implied that the onset ofllipticine-induced cell death involves Akt signaling and wortman-in blocked cell progression mostly at S- and G2/M phases, whereasells of sub-G1 state were reduced.

The appearance of proteolyticleavage of the precursor PARP marked the final commitment ofpoptosis. In drug-treated A549 cells, the intense 89-kDa fragmentf PARP in Western blot serves as a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 3).vpcb63 (2009) 227\u2013234 229he induced p53 was no longer observed 48 h after treatment. Thenduced MDM2 at 48 h was associated with degradation of tran-iently activated p53. The effect was suppressed by wortmanninnd the induced apoptosis reverted.The enhanced phosphorylation serine-473 of Akt was detectedday after ellipticine treatment as indicated by Western blotFig. 4A). The intensity of phosphorylated Akt was increased byore than 2-fold before final dephosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Theffect was blocked by wortmannin and proved reproducible. On thether hand, Akt-dependent phosphorylation on serine-21 of glyco-en synthase kinase-3\ufffd (GSK3\ufffd), a downstream target specific forkt, was increased and then returned to its basal level, while thentensities of GSK3\ufffd were unchanged. The addition of wortmanninuppressed the transient phosphorylation..4. Ellipticine induced nucleus translocation of Akt in A549 cellsBy analyzing protein extracts from cytoplasmic and nuclear frac-ions, Akt was found migrated into nucleus following ellipticinereatment. Both cytoplasmic and nucleus Akt was found phospho-ylated after drug treatment as evidenced from Akt-Ser473-specificntibody incubation (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the phosphory-ated Akt was found only in cytoplasmic fraction after wortmanninreatment. Besides, in immunostaining experiments, phosphory-ated Akt located in both nucleus and cytoplasm after ellipticinereatment, was retained in cytoplasm by wortmannin (Fig. 5B). Inddition, nucleus translocation of p53 was also assisted by ellip-icine, and the movement was blocked when cultured togetherith wortmannin as shown in p53 antibody-stained fluorescencexperiment..5. Increased autophagy is associated with ellipticine-inducedpoptosis in A549 cellsAutophagy has gained increasing attention as an alternativeoute toward cell death. Microtubule-associated light chain LC3 isn important component during autophagosome formation. These of the GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid has become an effective markeror the autophagy progression. A549 cells were transfected withFP-LC3 plasmid and the distribution of GFP can be detected. Ashown in Fig. 6A, diffuse cytoplasmic localization of GFP-LC3 wasbserved in untreated A549 cells, whereas ellipticine-treated cellscquired increased punctate fluorescence that overlapped withysotracker positive spots after 48 h, which suggested the pres-nce of autophagic cells relevant to apoptosis. The increases inunctate fluorescence by ellipticine can be neutralized in cellsreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA). In addition, the viabilityas observed increased in cells treated with increasing concentra-ions of 3-MA compared to those with ellipticine alone, indicatinghat the autophagy attributed to apoptotic cell death due to ellip-icine (Fig. 6B). Thus, autophagic cells are closely related to thenset of apoptotic tumor cell killing, suggesting the importance ofutophagy in ellipticine-mediated growth inhibition..6.

DiscussionMore detailed mechanisms on the drug action concerningllipticine-induced cell death were gradually uncovered. Previ-us studies reported that p53 and Fas/Fas ligand death receptorre involved in ellipticine-mediated cell growth inhibition [5,7].ore work indicated that ellipticine induced endoplasmic retic-lum stress that contributed to the drug cytotoxicity [1]. EllipticineRETs capable of activating p53 downstream responsive elements and,herefore, causing apoptotic cell death in cells in a panel of can-er cells as an effective growth inhibitor [2,4,16]. As an effectiveopoisomerase II inhibitor that specifically acted in A549 lung can-er cells, ellipticine arrested cells first at S- and G2/M check pointsdrtawted overlapped with Lysotracker in ellipticine-treated A549 cells.

The final growth inhi-ition was blocked by wortmannin by suppressing sub-G1 cellopulation and the viable cells increased proportionally.DNA damage in cells causes either irreversible senescence orpoptosis in tumor cells [14,17\u201319]. The characteristic markeror apoptosis, cleaved PARP in response to environmental stress,ppeared on the third day after treatment. The late appearancef intense 89-kDa fragment of nuclear polymerase PARP involvedn DNA repair marked delayed apoptotic cell death following pro-onged cell arrest. In this work, we showed that ellipticine inhibitedhe growth of A549 cells by first activating p53 accompanied withleavage of 116-kDa precursor, PARP, into 89-kDa fragment. Thereakdown of the induced p53 and MDM2 began on the thirday and the effect was suppressed by wortmannin. The delayedesponse to topoisomerase inhibitor in carcinoma cells with wild-ype p53 can be characterized by prolonged cell arrest withoutpparent apoptosis [20,21]. For instance, the growth of NSCLC cellsas blocked at G2/M phase and exhibited senescence-like stateK. Fang et al. / Lung Cancer 63 (2009) 227\u2013234 233Fig. 7.

Previous report indicated that treatmentith cisplatin, etoposide, or vincristine to murine hematopoieticells led to initial up-regulation of phosphorylated Akt, followedy rapid dephosphorylation to its basal level and the drug resis-ance was increased without suppressing cell growth [22]. Ourork demonstrated that ellipticine arrested A549 cells first at G2/Mhase by modulating Akt phosphorylation before final commit-ent to cell death. How cells were retained at G2/M phase alongith transient Akt phosphorylation is not completely understood.Akt phosphorylation by ellipticine was terminated by wort-annin (Fig. 4B), and the effect attenuated ellipticine-induced celleath. Since functional PTEN was reportedly active in A549 cells23], the ellipticine-induced phosphorylation of Akt on serine-473ould be attributed to PTEN activation. In some cases, treatmentith wortmannin alone is sufficient to inhibit Akt activity and cellroliferation, thereby promoting apoptosis [24,25]. In this work,hen wortmannin is included in culture, the ellipticine-mediatedhosphorylation became inactivated and nucleus translocation ofkt blocked. The results further suggested that, despite brief Aktctivation, ellipticine eventually acts as a specific inhibitor of thekt-dependent signaling pathway, thereby making it an effectiverug in treating lung cancer.Akt activation promotes survival of NSCLC cells [23]. Thectivated Akt can be located to cell membrane in response totimulation by growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1IGF-1). After mitogenic stimulation, Akt phosphorylates multipleRETRAubstrates related to cell cycle progression and lead to reductionf p53transactivation [26]. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domainf Akt was reportedly a membrane-targeting module. AfterGF-1stimulation, the PH domain of Akt is required for nucleusranslocation and the movement terminated by wortmannin [27].aialt4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then299-p53 cells plated on coverslips in 60-cm plates were treated with ellipticine ined, stained with Akt antibody (red) and counterstained with DAPI to visualize theince there is no nuclear signal sequence, how Akt is introducednto nucleus, phosphorylated and affects downstream regulatorsn NSCLC cells including apoptosis signals awaits further investiga-ion. It will be of great value to determine how ellipticine interactsith Akt and assists in its nuclear translocalization. While ellip-icine promoted Akt nucleus translocation and phosphorylation,he activation may stabilize p53 without binding to Mdm2 andherefore slow down the ubiquitination and degradation of p5328]. The activation of p53 also might block the anti-apoptoticffects of Akt, thereby leading to apoptosis [29]. The presentork was conducted in A549 cells and in the stable clones withxogenous p53. Whether the effect is applicable in other cellsemains to be seen. Unlike A549 cells, an enhanced Akt phos-horylation at serine-473 in both H322 and H1437 cells carryingutated p53 was not detected (data not shown) and treatmentith ellipticine did not affect their growth rate. Thus, it is likelyhat wild-type p53 and Akt act together in leading cell death byllipticine. However, our results do not rule out the possibilityhat Akt directly promotes p53 stabilization and final degradationhrough different regulatory mechanisms.Tumor cells may undergo both apoptosis and autophagy inesponse to some anticancer drugs, and the two pathways mayccur separately or simultaneously. The disruption of the PI3K/Aktignaling pathway enhanced autophagy and induced apoptosishat contributed to the drug effectiveness in malignant gliomaells [30]. Modulation of Akt activity through pharmacologicalCpproaches promises good implication toward therapeutic modal-ties [24]. It has been shown that tumor suppressor PTEN mediatesutophagy [31]. The deficiencies in suppression of autophagy canead to malignant transformation [32]. Previous reports indicatedhat Akt inhibitor exerted anticancer effect as a result of radiosen-2 ancersip[taigCANR[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[33] Fujiwara K, Iwado E, Mills GB, Sawaya R, Kondo S, Kondo Y.

Strategies in developing Aktnhibitions have been demonstrated effective in modulating cellroliferation and/or apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in cancer cells34]. Despite the potential values of Akt inhibitors as useful cancerherapy, only few of them have been reported. Our work providesnew dimension of ellipticine as an effective Akt modulator thats closely associated with the onset of apoptosis for controlling therowth of NSCLC cells.onflict of interest statementNone declared.cknowledgementThis work is supported in part by grants from National Taiwanormal University, Taipei, Taiwan (Grant number 95A10).eferences[1] Hagg M, Berndtsson M, Mandic A, Zhou R, Shoshan MC, Linder S.
