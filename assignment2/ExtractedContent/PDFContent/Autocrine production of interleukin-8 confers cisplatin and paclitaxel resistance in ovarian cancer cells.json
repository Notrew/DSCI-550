Waa b s t r a c tIt has been widely reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8) is overexpressed in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum,and tumor tissue from ovarian cancer (OVCA) patients, and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with apoor final outcome and chemosensitivity. However, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of thechemoresistance phenotype and the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cells are notyet fully understood. Here we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period of treatment withrecombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) inducecisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-expressing A2780 cells, while deleting of endogenous IL-8expression in IL-8-overexpressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8)promotes the sensitivity of these cells to anticancer drugs. IL-8-mediated resistance of OVCA cells exhib-its decreased proteolytic activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, the further study demonstrates that thechemoresistance caused by IL-8 is associated with increased expression of both multidrug resistance-related genes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP), as well as activationof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signalingpathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resistant OVCA.\ufffd 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.1. IntroductionOvarian cancer (OVCA) is the second most common and themost deadly malignancy of the female reproductive tract [1].Although tumor-reductive surgery and carboplatin- and paclit-axel-based chemotherapy regimens are effective treatments forprimary disease in the majority of OVCA patients, recurrence iscommon and often leads to death. As a consequence, the overall5-year survival is only 30% [2]. Thus, there is a pressing need toeither identify novel therapies for OVCA or to discover drugs which(re)sensitize tumor cells to existing chemotherapy. Several factorshave previously been implicated in drug resistance, includinggenes which regulate drug influx and efflux, drug metabolism,damage repair, and the apoptotic response to drug-induced dam-age. Indeed, it is possible that numerous resistance mechanismsElsevier Ltd.nology, Medical College ofrict, Chenlin Road, No. 211,2 60578099; fax: +86 22 022ng).could contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype and these mecha-nisms might be coordinately regulated [3].Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a multifunctional chemokine that is se-creted by multiple cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils,endothelial and mesothelial cells, and tumor cells. As a memberof the Cysteine-X-Cysteine (CXC) motif chemokines, IL-8 is respon-sible for recruiting neutrophils, T cells, and basophils during im-mune system activation [4\u20137]. Induction of IL-8 expression ismediated primarily by activator protein and/or nuclear factor kap-pa B (NF-jB), although additional hormone response elements andnuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL-6) consensus sites have been character-ized on the IL-8 gene promote [8]. Studies have shown that tumorprogression and metastasis may be associated with overexpressionof IL-8 [9,10].IL-8 was elevated in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumortissue from OVCA patients [11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expressionwas associated with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity[19\u201322]. Our previous study demonstrated that IL-8 may contributeto OVCA cell growth partly through the activation of androgenreceptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) pathways [23,24]. In vitrostudies with OVCA cell lines show that generation of paclitaxel-resistant sublines is often associated with increased IL-8 mRNAhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005mailto:wy68wy68@yahoo.com.cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666366 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375expression using cDNA array technology [25]. However, the role ofIL-8 expression in the acquisition of the chemoresistance phenotypeand the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cellsremain unclear.IL-8 exerts its effects by binding to two cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), IL-8 receptor A and IL-8 receptor B orCXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively. Both receptors are expressed onmost tumor cells as well as on endothelial cells [26,27]. Signals aretransmitted across the membrane through ligand-induced confor-mational changes, exposing epitopes on the intracellular loops andcarboxy-terminal tail of the receptor that promote coupling to func-tional heterotrimeric G proteins. After activation of heterotrimericsmall G proteins, IL-8 signaling promotes activation of the primaryeffectors PI3 K (phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase) or phospholipase C,promoting the activation of Akt, PKC (protein kinase C), calciummobilization and/or Ras/Raf/MEK(mitogen-activated protein orextracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)/ERK(extracellularsignal regulated kinase) signaling cascades [8]. In addition, IL-8 sig-naling activates members of the RhoGTPase family and activates anumber of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [e.g., Src family kinasesand focal adhesion kinase (FAK)] that regulate the architecture ofthe cell cytoskeleton and its interaction with the surrounding extra-cellular environment [8]. Recently, growing evidence suggests acti-vation of PI3 K/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334] signalingpathways play an important role in chemoresistance of OVCA.Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential mechanism thatIL-8 induces chemoresistance of OVCA cells by triggering activationof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling.In this study, we investigated the role of IL-8 expression in mod-ulating cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in OVCA cells.Furthermore, we also explored possible underlying mechanismsinvolved in drug resistance induced by IL-8. Our data suggest thatthe autocrine production of IL-8 by OVCA cells promotes resistanceof these cells to chemotherapy through decrease of proteolytic acti-vation of caspase-3. The further study demonstrates that IL-8-in-duced resistance of OVCA cells may be associated with up-regulation of multidrug resistance-related genes [multidrug resis-tance gene 1 (MDR1)] and apoptosis inhibitory proteins [Bcl-2,Bcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)], as well as activa-tion of Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3 K/Akt signaling.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell lines and cell cultureHuman OVCA cell lines A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 were ob-tained from the American Type Culture Collection. A2780 andSKOV-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.,Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (LifeTechnologies, Inc.), CAOV-3 cells were grown in DMEM (Life Tech-nologies, Inc.) with 15% FBS.Recombinant human IL-8 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) wasused to pretreat A2780 cells. The cells were cultured in the pres-ence of exogenous IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 10 days. IL-8 was added tothe culture every 2 days [35]. After the pretreatment period, thecells (A2780/preIL-8) were harvested, washed, and replated inthe presence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxelwas determined by the MTT assay.2.2. pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8 vector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector) expression vector constructionA 318 base pair cDNA fragment containing the full ORF of humanIL-8 was amplified by RT-PCR from the RNA of SKOV-3 cell line thatoverexpresses IL-8. PCR primers for sense IL-8 were: forward50-CTCGGATCCATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a Bam-HI site as italicized, and reverse 50-AGACTCGAGTTATGAATTCTCAGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a XhoI site as italicized. PCR primers forantisense IL-8 were: forward 50-CTCGGATCCATGTGAATTCT-CAGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a BamHI site as italicized, and reverse50-AGACTCGAGTTAACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a XhoIsite as italicized. The resulting sense or antisense IL-8 PCR productwas cloned to pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector using Invitrogen\u2019s Original TA CloningKit (Carlsbad, CA, USA). After sequence confirmation, sense or anti-sense IL-8 was cut from the pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector, purified, subcloned tothe BamHI and EcoRI (Life Technologies) sites of the pcDNA3.1(+)expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). We used DNA se-quence analysis and restriction enzyme mapping to distinguish be-tween the resulting plasmids, pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8vector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector), whichconstitutively expressed the IL-8 cDNA in the sense and antisenseorientations, respectively, from a cytomegalovirus promoter. Weused the pcDNA3.1(+) vector without IL-8 inserts as negative con-trols in subsequent experiments.2.3. Generation and selection of cells stably transfected withpcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8Transfection was done using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen,San Diego, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. A2780 and SKOV-3 cells (4 \ufffd 105) were plated onto 6-wellplates until 90\u201395% confluence before transfection. A2780 cellswere transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8, and SKOV-3cells were transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8. Selectionfor the neomycin gene was initiated 48 h after transfection by add-ing 500 lg (A2780 cells) or 600 lg (SKOV-3 cells) of G418 (LifeTechnologies)/mL to the supplemented culture medium. Thisselection medium was changed every 2 days for 4 weeks, until allnon-transfected cells died. Resistant cell clones were isolated andexpanded for further characterization. The empty vectorpcDNA3.1(+) was also transfected into A2780 or SKOV-3 cellsand served as negative controls.2.4. Semiquantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, SanDiego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primer se-quences were designed by Vector NTI 8 software and synthesizedby TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The primer se-quences were as follow: IL-8, 50-AACATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCG-30(forward) and 50-CAGTTTT CCTTGGGGTCCAGAC-30 (reverse), forMDR1, 50-TGACTACCAGGCTCGCCAATGA T-30 (forward) and 50-TGTGCCACCAAGTAGGCTCCAAA-30 (reverse), for Bcl-2, 50-TGC ACCTGACGCCCTTCAC-30 (forward) and 50-AGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCAAACAG-30 (reverse), for Bcl-xL, 50-ATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGAGC-30 (for-ward) and 50-GCGATC CGACTCACCAATACCT-30 (reverse), for XIAP,50-ATGATACCATCTTCCAAAATC C-30 (forward) and 50-TTTCTGTAATGAAGTCTGACTT-30 (reverse), for b-actin, 50-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATC-CATGAAAC-30 (forward) and 50-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCC-30 (reverse). One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa Biotechnology)was used to do RT-PCR. PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% aga-rose gel and analyzed with Quantity One-4.5.6 software (Bio-Rad,Hercules, CA). The results were normalized against b-actin, and pre-sented as target mRNA: b-actin ratio.2.5. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The cells were cultured for 48 h in 1 ml of medium containing5% charcoal-stripped FBS (sFBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thesupernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation. TheY. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 367level of IL-8 was measured using ELISA Kits (R&D Systems)according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.2.6. Western blot analysisAnalysis and quantitation were performed as previouslydescribed [35]. In brief, cell lysates were subjected to 8\u201312 %SDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-8RA, anti-IL-8RB, anti-MDR1, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, or anti-XIAPantibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively.Membranes were stripped by incubating with stripping buffer at50 \ufffdC for 30 min and then blotted with mouse monoclonal anti-b-ac-tin antibody (Sigma). Immunodetection was performed using thecorresponding secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, and HRP activ-ity was detected using chemiluminescent substrate Kit (SuperSig-nal\ufffd Westpico Trial Kit, Pierce Biochemicals).A2780 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes with thedensity of 4 \ufffd 106 cells for 24 h, and then incubated in 5% sFBSwith vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), or PD98059(25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Total celllysates were isolated and quantified. The phosphorylation status ofAkt and ERK was analyzed by Western blot as described above, ex-cept that the filters were probed with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)to detect phosphorylated Akt or phosphorylated ERK, visualizedby chemiluminescent substrate Kit. The filters were subsequentlystripped and then reprobed with anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signal-ing Technology, Beverly, MA) or anti-ERK (BD Biosciences, SanDiego, CA) to detect both the phosphorylated and unphosphory-lated forms of Akt or ERK.2.7. Cytotoxicity assayIn vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed by MTT assay aspreviously described [23,24]. MTT was obtained from Sigma(St. Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, 4 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated in96-well plates. Culture medium was RPMI 1640 containingincreasing concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel (all obtainedfrom commercial sources). After culture for 48 h, MTT solution(0.5 mg/ml PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h.After dissolving the resulting formazan product with acid-isopro-panol, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using ELISA micro-plate reader. Data represents the average absorbance of six wells inone experiment. The percentage of surviving cells was estimatedby dividing the A490 nm of treated cells by the A490 nm of controlcells. The IC50 is defined as the drug concentration required to in-hibit A490 to 50% of the control value. IC50 values were estimatedfrom the dose\u2013response curve. Data were derived from at leastthree independent experiments.A2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8) were plated in96-well plates at 4 \ufffd 103 cells per well for 24 h, and then incubatedin 5% sFBS with vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), orPD98059 (25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) and cis-platin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) or control for48 h. MTT assay was performed as described above. Data areshown as the mean \u00b1 SD of two separate experiments with sextu-ple samples.2.8. Caspase-3 activation assayCaspase-3 activation assay was performed as previouslydescribed [35]. Briefly, cells left untreated or treated with 10 lMcisplatin or 0.1 lM paclitaxel for 24 h and then lysed in lysis bufferfor 10 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpmfor 5 min, and 100 lg of protein was incubated with 20 ll of reac-tion buffer and 10 ll of caspase-3 substrate at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h, andabsorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a platereader. Blank values were subtracted, and fold increase in activitywas calculated based on activity measured from untreated cells.Each sample was measured in triplicates.2.9. Statistical analysisData are expressed as the mean of three experiments, each intriplicate or sextuple samples for individual treatments or dosageregimens. Statistical analysis was carried out using a one-way AN-OVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Values are presented as themean \u00b1 SD. All statistical tests were two-sided and were consid-ered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Comparing expression levels of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA andIL-8RB) as well as sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCAcell linesIn order to investigate the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisi-tion of the chemoresistance phenotype in OVCA cells, we first ana-lyzed the expression of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) aswell as the response to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA celllines. The secretion levels of IL-8 were significant various in threeOVCA as shown in Fig. 1A. High and middle levels of IL-8 secretionwere observed in CAOV-3 (12298.40 \u00b1 305.47 pg/ml) and SKOV-3(715.92 \u00b1 35.28 pg/ml), respectively. However, no IL-8 was de-tected in the supernatant from A2780 cells. The mRNA levels ofIL-8 resembled their respective protein levels in three OVCA cells(Fig. 1B). As determined by Western blot analysis, these three celllines were demonstrated to express IL-8RA and IL-8RB (Fig. 1C).The sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel also varied among thesecell lines as shown in Fig. 1D and E. A2780 cells were the most sen-sitive (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were 8.06 \u00b1 0.49 lV and0.74 \u00b1 0.08 lV, respectively), whereas CAOV-3 (IC50 for cisplatinand paclitaxel were 74.40 \u00b1 0.82 lV and 9.65 \u00b1 0.35 lV, respec-tively) and SKOV-3 cells (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were66.19 \u00b1 3.42 lV and 6.67 \u00b1 0.17 lV, respectively), were drug-resis-tant (P < 0.001), indicating that autocrine production level of IL-8by OVCA cell lines were inversely associated with their sensitivityto cisplatin and paclitaxel. Taken together, these results suggestthat IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, A2780 (non-IL-8-expressing and drug-sensitive) and CAOV-3 or SKOV-3 (IL-8-over-expressing and drug-resistant) are the suitable cell models toinvestigate the effect of IL-8 on cisplatin- or paclitaxel-mediatedcytotoxicity in OVCA cells.3.2. IL-8 confers cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cellsPrevious reports have suggested that elevated IL-8 expressioncorrelates with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity[19\u201322]. In correlation, our above results showed that autocrineproduction level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines were inversely associ-ated with their responsiveness to cisplatin and paclitaxel. It sug-gests that IL-8 could play a role in the resistance of OVCA cells tothe cytotoxic activities of anticancer compounds. To address thishypothesis, A2780 cells were cultured in the presence or absenceof IL-8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells wereharvested, washed, and replated in the presence or absence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel was determinedby the MTT assay [23,24]. Pretreatment of A2780 cells with IL-8caused 6.07-fold and 7.23-fold increase in resistance to cisplatinand paclitaxel, respectively (P < 0.001, Fig. 2), indicating that thepresence of exogenous IL-8 increased the resistance of OVCA cellsto cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.Fig. 1. Expression pattern of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) as well as different sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA cell lines. (A and B) Expression ofIL-8 protein and mRNA in OVCA cell lines. Secreted IL-8 production in three cell lines were analyzed by ELISA. Data are shown as the mean of three separate experiments withtriplicate samples and represent the mean \u00b1 SD. The mRNA level of IL-8 was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Target fragment levels were normalized against b-actin. (C)Expression of IL-8RA and IL-8RB protein in OVCA cell lines. The same amount of total cell lysate of A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells were separated by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE gel,followed by Western blot with anti-IL-8RA antibody, anti-IL-8RB antibody or anti-b-actin antibody. Target protein levels were normalized against b-actin to control forvariance in sample loading and transfer. (D and E) Different responsiveness to cisplatin or paclitaxel in A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells was assessed by the MTT assay. Theexperiment shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results.368 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375To determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 by tu-mor cells could provide self-protection against drug-induced celldeath, we constitutively expressed IL-8 in A2780 cells and inhib-ited expression of IL-8 in SKOV-3 cells and examined the effectof IL-8 expression on the drug resistance of these cells. A2780 cellswere transfected with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8 and SKOV-3cells were transfected with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8.Stable A2780 (A2780/ssIL-8) and SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/asIL-8) transfec-ted clones were isolated and screened for their ability to produceIL-8. Three representative clones that produced low (19.86 \u00b16.24 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8L), middle (73.44 \u00b1 9.02 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8 M) and high (101.81 \u00b1 13.01 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8H) levelsof IL-8 (P < 0.001, Fig. 3A) and two representative clones that weremiddle (64.13%, SKOV-3/asIL-8 Mi) and high (77.52%, SKOV-3/asIL-8Hi) inhibition of IL-8 production (P < 0.001, Fig. 3C) comparedwith the corresponding parental (i.e., untransfected) and controlvector-transfected A2780 and SKOV-3 cells were chosen for subse-quent studies. The levels of IL-8 gene expression in the stabletransfected clones were also examined by semiquantitative RT-PCRanalysis. The levels of IL-8 mRNA were consistent with the secretedIL-8 levels in these stable transfected clones (Fig. 3B and D).To determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 inA2780 cells can confer resistance to drug treatment, we examinedthe susceptibility or resistance of ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells tocisplatin or paclitaxel treatment using the MTT assay. As shown inFig.4A and B, A2780/ssIL-8L, A2780/ssIL-8M and A2780/ssIL-8Hcells exhibited increased resistance to both cisplatin (6.49-fold,7.39-fold and 8.53-fold, respectively) and paclitaxel (6.36-fold,7.59-fold and 8.08-fold, respectively), as compared withparental A2780 cells (P < 0.001). Control A2780/pcDNA3.1(+) cellsthat did not produce IL-8 exhibited similar drug sensitivity toparental A2780 cells (P > 0.05). These data suggest that over-expressing of IL-8 confers a moderate level of drug resistance inOVCA cells.To determine whether deleting of endogenous IL-8 in SKOV-3cells could increase their responsiveness to drug treatment, wealso examined the susceptibility or resistance of asIL-8-transfectedSKOV-3 cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel. In correlation with datafrom ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells, SKOV-3/asIL-8Mi and SKOV-3/asIL-8Hi cells exhibited increased responsiveness to both cis-platin (IC50 was 10.58 \u00b1 1.67 and 7.75 \u00b1 0.88 lV, respectively,Fig. 4C) and paclitaxel (IC50 was 0.89 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.76 \u00b1 0.04 lV,respectively, Fig. 4D) as compared with parental SKOV-3 (IC50 forcisplatin and paclitaxel were 66.50 \u00b1 3.42 and 6.79 \u00b1 0.45 lV,respectively) and control SKOV-3/pcDNA3.1(+) cells (IC50 for cis-platin and paclitaxel were 65.32 \u00b1 4.18 and 6.74 \u00b1 0.33 lV, respec-tively) (P < 0.001), which did not vary (P > 0.05). These resultsindicate that deleting of endogenous IL-8 by OVCA cells restorestheir response to chemotherapy.Caspase-3 plays a direct role in proteolytic cleavage of cellularproteins responsible for progression to apoptosis. To test whethercisplatin and paclitaxel resistance or susceptibility in ss/asIL-8-transfected cells may have affected caspase-3 activity with cis-platin or paclitaxel exposure, we measured caspase-3 activities inthese cells after exposure to two drugs. As shown in Fig. 5, therewas a significantly reduced level of caspase-3 in ssIL-8-transfectedA2780 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5A and B), while there was a markedlyincreased in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5C andFig. 2. Treatment with IL-8 increased the resistance of A2780 cells. A2780 cellswere cultured in the presence (A2780/preIL-8) or absence (A2780) of exogenous IL-8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells were replated in the presenceor absence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin (A) or paclitaxel (B) wasdetermined by the MTT assay. The experiment shown is representative of threeindependent experiments with similar results.Y.

Representative ELISA and RT-PCR demonstrating levels of IL-8 expression in A278empty vector or with vector encoding for sense IL-8, and SKOV-3 cells were stably transfeIL-8-transfected A2780 clones that produced low (A2780/ssIL-8L), middle (A2780/ssIIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 clones that were middle (SKOV-3/asIL-8Mi) and high (SKOV-3vector-transfected A2780 and SKOV-3 cells were isolated for further studies. \u2044P > 0.05, \u20443.3. IL-8 up-regulates MDR1 expression in OVCA cellsCross-resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel suggests a mul-tidrug resistant phenotype possibly explained by drug transport ormetabolism, cellular repair or detoxification mechanisms. To eval-uate this possibility the expression of several genes already knownto be involved in the mutidrug resistance phenomenon [MDR1,glutathione S transferase pi (GSTpi), multidrug resistance-associ-ated protein (MRP), lung resistance-related protein (LRP) and topo-isomerase I (TopoI)] in above several OVCA cell lines was firstmeasured by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.This analysis demonstrates that the mRNA and protein levels ofMDR1, GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) are lower inA2780 cells, while those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells,indicating that autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA celllines were consistent with the expression levels of above severalputative resistance factors in these cells. To determine the effectsof exogenous and endogenous IL-8 on mutidrug resistance-relatedgenes, we further studied IL-8-induced above several putativeresistance factors expression of mRNA and protein in A2780 cellstreated with IL-8, ss/asIL-8-transfected cells and the correspondinguntransfected and control vector-transfected cells by semiquanti-tative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. IL-8 significantly up-reg-ulated the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 (Fig. 6A and B) butnot GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) in a dose-depen-dent manner in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MDR1(Fig. 7A and B) but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown)enhanced in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 7A and B), and re-duced in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 7C and D) comparedwith the corresponding parental and control vector-transfectedcells, which had no difference. Therefore, these data suggest thatIL-8 may confer cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cellsby increasing MDR1 expression.3.4.

To determinethe another potential mechanism through which IL-8 causeschemotherapy resistance in OVCA cells, we also examined theexpression levels of several apoptosis inhibitory proteins in aboveseveral OVCA cell lines. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP and survivin (data not shown), are lower in A2780 cells,whereas those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells, suggestingthat autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines werealso in agreement with the expression levels of four apoptosisinhibitory proteins studied in these cells. To determine the effectsof IL-8 on these apoptosis inhibitory proteins, we further studiedIL-8-mediated mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAPFig. 8. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP in three stable ssIL-8-transfected A2780 clones (A and B), two asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 clones (C and D), andthe corresponding parental and vector control cells.

The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results.372 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375and survivin in A2780 cells treated with IL-8, ss/asIL-8-transfectedcells and the corresponding untransfected and control vector-transfected cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotanalysis. IL-8 significantly increased the mRNA and protein levelsof Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 6C and D) in a dose-dependent man-ner, but had no effect on the mRNA and protein levels of survivin(data not shown) in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels ofBcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 8) but not survivin (data not shown)up-regulated in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 8A and B),and down-regulated in as IL-8-transfected SKOV3 cells (Fig. 8Cand D) compared with the corresponding untransfected and con-trol vector-transfected cells, which did not vary. Taken together,these results suggest that IL-8 may cause chemoresistance in OVCAcells by enhancing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP expression.3.5. IL-8-induced chemoresistance to OVCA cells is through PI3K/Aktand Ras/MEK/ERK activationTo investigate what role PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK pathwaysplay in the signal transduction of IL-8 in OVCA cells, we deter-mined the effects of wortmannin, a PI3 K specific inhibitor at 100or 200 nmol/L, and PD98059, a MEK1/2 specific inhibitor at 25 or50 lmol/L, on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK andIL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance of A2780 cells. Itwas found that wortmannin and PD98059 significantly antago-nized IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, respectively(Fig. 9A and B), and both of them blocked IL-8-induced cisplatinand paclitaxel resistance (Fig. 9C and D) and the inhibitory effectsof wortmannin and PD98059 were dependent on its concentration.These data confirm that activation of Akt and ERK are mediated byPI3 K- and MEK1/2-dependent mechanism, respectively, andsuggest that IL-8-induced cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance to OVCAcells is through activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.In addition to detecting increased phosphorylation of Akt, in-crease in Akt expression in A2780 cells was also indicated by den-sitometry analysis after stimulation with IL-8 (Fig. 9B). Therefore,our experiments indicate that IL-8 signaling increases both theactivation and the expression level of Akt in OVCA cells.4. DiscussionIt has been widely reported that IL-8 is overexpressed in ovariancyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumor tissue from OVCA patients[11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with a poor finaloutcome [15,22] and chemosensitivity [19\u201322]. Previous workfrom our group and others has shown that IL-8 promotes OVCA cellgrowth [22\u201324,27]. In the present study, we first demonstratedthat autocrine production level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines, includingA2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3, is inversely associated with their re-sponse to cisplatin and paclitaxel. Some studies have consistentlydemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells are resistant to cis-platin, while A2780 cells are responsive [40,41]. Our data furtherdemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells were also paclit-axel-resistant and A2780 cells were paclitaxel-sensitive. Further-more, we found that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells produced higherlevels of IL-8, while A2780 cells do not. Notably, we also observedthat A2780 cells expressed IL-8 receptor, though they did not se-crete IL-8, suggesting that the expression of IL-8 receptor by OVCAcells could be not associated with their IL-8 production status.Therefore, IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, non-IL-8-express-ing and cisplatin/paclitaxel-responsive A2780, and IL-8-over-expressing and cisplatin/paclitaxel-resistant CAOV-3 or SKOV-3were used to study the effect of IL-8 on multidrug resistance, butin our study, A2780 and SKOV-3 cell lines were chosen as suitablecell models.Fig. 9. Effects of wortmannin or PD98059 on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt or ERK in A2780 cells and IL-8-mediated cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance to A2780 cellspretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), PD98059 (25 or 50 lM) or DMSO of equal volume for 30 min at 37 \ufffdCbefore IL-8 was added into the medium. (A and B) A2780 cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence of IL-8. After the cells were collected and washed, whole-cell extracts wereprepared and subjected to Western blot assay. (C and D) The cells were seeded into 96-well plate (4 \ufffd 104 cells per well) and cultured in the presence of IL-8 (50 ng/ml) andcisplatin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) for 48 h. Afterwards, MTT assay was performed to determine the effect of wortmannin and PD98059 on IL-8-inducedcisplatin or paclitaxe resistance to A2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The experiment shown is the average data of three independent experiments. \u2044P > 0.05,compared with control; \u2044\u2044P < 0.001, compared with cisplatin or paclitaxel (no inhibitors).Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 373Several recent studies have addressed the role of IL-8 in tumorcell chemoresistance, including in melanoma [42], colorectal can-cer [43], renal cell carcinoma [44], and prostate cancer [45,46].However, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of the mul-tidrug resistance phenotype in OVCA has not been investigated.Here we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period oftreatment with recombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (bytransfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) induce cisplatinand paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-producing A2780 cells,whereas deleting of endogenous IL-8 expression in IL-8-over-expressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encodingfor antisense IL-8) promotes the sensitivity of these cells to anti-cancer drugs. Meanwhile, we confirm that IL-8-mediated resis-tance of OVCA cells exhibits decreased proteolytic activation ofcaspase-3. These findings suggest that the production of IL-8 pro-tects the cells from cytotoxic agents through down-regulation ofproteolytic activation of caspase-3 and expression level of IL-8 ispositively associated with their degree of chemoresistance in OVCAcells. Other studies have shown that transfection of IL-8 into colo-rectal cancer [43] or prostate cancer cell line [45] causes drug resis-tance and inhibition of IL-8 overexpression in colorectal cancer[43] or prostate cancer [45,46] cell lines with small interferingRNA (siRNA) increases the sensitivity of these cells to anticancerdrugs. Thus, some tumor cells may acquire the ability to expressand produce IL-8 as a protective mechanism against drug induceddeath. The stimuli responsible for the constitutive expression of IL-8 in chemoresistant cells are not yet fully understood. Previousfindings have suggested that expression of IL-8 is regulated by anumber of different stimuli including inflammatory signals (e.g.,tumor necrosis factor a, IL-1b), chemical and environmentalstresses (e.g., exposure to chemotherapy agents and hypoxia),and steroid hormones (e.g., androgens, estrogens, and dexametha-sone; reviewed in Ref. [47]). These stimuli may be associated withthe constitutive expression of IL-8 in chemoresistant cells, but fur-ther experiments need to be done to determine this presumption.In OVCA, up to two-thirds tumor specimens have been found tooverexpress MDR1 (also known as ABCB1, which encodes the P-glycoprotein) on immunohistochemistry [48\u201350], and this overex-pression has been shown in some cases to correlate with pooroverall survival and chemotherapy resistance. Recently studieshave shown that inhibition of MDR1 expression by siRNA in humanmultidrug resistant OVCA cell lines enhances the intracellularaccumulation of and restored sensitivity to cisplatin [51]. The re-sults of the many studies cited above suggests that MDR1 playan important role in the mechanisms responsible for chemoresis-tance of OVCA cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-8 regulatesexpression of MDR1 but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI in OVCAcells, in correlation, increases the resistance of the cells to cis-platin/paclitaxel treatment. Thus, the regulation of MDR1 geneexpression is a potential mechanism by which IL-8 provides drugprotection. In this study, we first demonstrate that IL-8 up-regu-lates MDR1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCAcells.A number of studies have shown that the anti-apoptotic abilityof IL-8 was associated with expression of the Bcl-2 and Inhibitor ofApoptosis (IAP) families proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin[46,52]. Bcl-2 [36], Bcl-xL [37], survivin [38] and XIAP [39] havebeen shown in OVCA to be associated with resistance to chemo-therapy. Thus, we investigated whether IL-8 alters the expressionof apoptosis inhibitory proteins as a mechanism of drug resistance.We found that IL-8 increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAPbut not survivin in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells as a374 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375mechanism of drug resistance. The enhancement of Bcl-2 andBcl-xL expression by IL-8 in OVCA cells is in accordance with theresults of Singh et al. [46] in prostate cancer cell line. While ourfindings that survivin levels are not altered by IL-8 in OVCA cellsis different from the results of Wilson et al. [52], who have reportedthat stimulation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cellswith IL-8 increases the transcription and expression of survivin.Here we provide the first evidence that IL-8 may up-regulates XIAPexpression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells.Several lines of evidence implicated that the activation of PI3K/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334], the most importantcell survival signalings, protects OVCA cells from chemotherapy.It has reported that Akt inactivation sensitizes human OVCA cellsto cisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29]. Moreover, the inactivation ofa downstream targets of the PI3 K/Akt pathway, such as BAD [28]and the transcription factors of Forkhead [53] and NFjB [54], alsosensitize human OVCA cells to cisplatin in vitro. Finally, Akt inacti-vation by a PI3 K inhibitor also enhances the sensitivity of OVCA tocisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29] in vivo. It has been shown that cis-platin treatment activates ERK in OVCA cells and that activation ofERK protects OVCA cells from cisplatin-induced death [32\u201334].Furthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling by the MEK1/2 inhibitorPD98059 blocked ERK activation and increased cisplatin sensitivityin SKOV-3 cells [33]. In this study, IL-8-induced activation of ERKand Akt in OVCA cells is blocked by their specific inhibitors to sig-nal transducers, which inhibit IL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxelresistance of OVCA cells. Also, we interestingly find that IL-8 in-creases not only phosphorylation of Akt but expression of Akt inOVCA cells, which is in accordance with the result of MacManuset al. [55] in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggestthat IL-8 promotes chemoresistance of OVCA cells via activation ofmultiple signal transduction pathways including PI3 K/Akt path-way and ERK cascade. In toto, these results provide support forthese signal transduction pathways as a strategy for reversing drugresistance.In summary, we conclude that IL-8 secreted by OVCA cells maycontribute to the refractoriness of these cells to conventional che-motherapy through down-regulation of proteolytic activation ofcaspase-3. Furthermore, IL-8-induced chemoresistance may beassociated with increase of both multidrug resistance-relatedgenes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xLand XIAP), as well as activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.Therefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signalingpathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resis-tant OVCA.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Grants from the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (No. 81041071), Tianjin Municipal Sci-ence and Technology Commission (No. 08JCYBJC06900), Postdoc-toral Science Foundation of China (No. 20080441340) andProgram for Science and Technology in Medical College of ChinesePeople\u2019s Armed Police Forces (No. WYM201105, WY200914).References[1] Risch HA.
