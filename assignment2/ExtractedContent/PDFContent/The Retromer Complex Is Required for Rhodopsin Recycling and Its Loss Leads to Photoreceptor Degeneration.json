Upon light exposure, activated rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) inDrosophila PRs is internalized via endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Whether internalized Rh1 can be recycled isunknown. Here, we show that the retromer complex is expressed in PRs where it is required for recycling endocytosed Rh1upon light stimulation. In the absence of subunits of the retromer, Rh1 is processed in the endolysosomal pathway, leadingto a dramatic increase in late endosomes, lysosomes, and light-dependent PR degeneration. Reducing Rh1 endocytosis orRh1 levels in retromer mutants alleviates PR degeneration. In addition, increasing retromer abundance suppressesdegenerative phenotypes of mutations that affect the endolysosomal system. Finally, expressing human Vps26 suppressesPR degeneration in Vps26 mutant PRs. We propose that the retromer plays a conserved role in recycling rhodopsins tomaintain PR function and integrity.Citation: Wang S, Tan KL, Agosto MA, Xiong B, Yamamoto S, et al.

Because vision is not required for animal survival, previousstudies in Drosophila mostly focused on viable mutations thatspecifically impair PR function [1]. However, it is likely thatnumerous additional players encoded by essential genes haveremained unidentified. We performed an eye-specific mosaicgenetic screen [6] and found that loss of subunits of the retromercauses light-induced PR degeneration.The retromer, a hetero-multimeric protein complex, re-trieves specific proteins from endosomes, thereby preventingthe degradation of these proteins in lysosomes [7\u20139]. Theretromer is composed of Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and certainsorting nexins (Snx) (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]). Most subunits areevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]). Mutations in somesubunits (Vps35 or Snx3) of the retromer have been shown todecrease the abundance of Wntless (Wls) and impair thesecretion of Wingless (Wg), a ligand of the Wnt signalingpathway [10\u201314]. Wls is a transmembrane protein that bindsto Wg and is required for Wg secretion [15,16]. Impairedretromer function leads to excessive degradation of Wls inlysosomes, severely reducing Wg secretion and signaling [10\u201314]. The retromer has also been shown to maintain the levelsof Crumbs, a transmembrane protein required for maintainingthe apicobasal polarity in some tissues [17,18]. More recently,PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847&domain=pdfmutations in human VPS35 have been shown to cause adominant inherited form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [19,20].However, the retromer has not been implicated in neurons ofthe visual system in flies or vertebrates.The Drosophila compound eye comprises ,800 hexagonal unitsnamed ommatidia [1,2,21,22]. Each ommatidium contains eightPRs (R1\u2013R8) that express rhodopsin proteins [1,2,21\u201323].Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) is the major rhodopsin that is primarilyexpressed in R1\u2013R6 [1,2,21,22]. It is synthesized and folded in theendoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to rhabdomeres, thestacked membranous structures in PRs, via the secretory pathway[1,2,21]. The proper transport of Rh1 from ER to rhabdomeresrequires molecular chaperones [24\u201330] and Rab GTPases [24\u201333]. Binding of opsins to chromophores [34\u201340] as well as proteinglycosylation and deglycosylation [41\u201344] are essential for Rh1folding and maturation. Mutations in genes involved in Rh1synthesis, folding, or transport can result in defective PRdevelopment or PR degeneration [24,25,32,41\u201343,45\u201351].Phototransduction in the PRs relies on the activation of Rh1 byphotons (Figure S1A, [52]). Active Rh1 (metarhodopsin, M*)activates phospholipase C (PLC) [53], which hydrolyzes phospha-tidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol(DAG) [54]. DAG or its metabolites can activate TransientReceptor Potential (TRP) and TRP-like cation channels that leadto depolarization of the PRs [55\u201359]. Similar to fly PRs, thevertebrate intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells(ipRGCs) use melanopsin (a homolog of fly Rh1) as the lightsensor and requires PLC and TRPC channels for activation [60\u201363]. ipRGCs project their axons to specific brain areas to controlcircadian rhythms [64\u201367] or pupillary light reflex [64,68,69].Tight regulation of Rh1 activity upon light exposure is requiredto maintain the integrity of PR cells [1,2]. M* can be convertedinto its inactive form upon exposure to orange light [52]. Inaddition, a significant portion of active Rh1 can be endocytosedand degraded in lysosomes [70\u201372]. Mutations that abolish Rh1deactivation [72\u201374] or impair the endolysosomal system[71,75,76] can cause PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation.However, it is unknown whether Rh1 can be retrieved from theendolysosomal compartments and whether impaired Rh1 recy-cling leads to PR degeneration.Here, we show that loss of the fly Vps26 or Vps35 causes early-onset PR degeneration. We show that retromer subunits areexpressed in PRs in flies and melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs in themouse retina. In fly mutant PRs, the numbers of late endosomesand lysosomes are significantly elevated. The PR degenerativephenotypes are dependent on exposure to light and the presence ofRh1. Our data indicate that the fly retromer recycles Rh1,preventing Rh1 retention in the PR cell bodies and shunting Rh1from being degraded in lysosomes, thereby promoting Rh1redelivery to rhabdomeres. In summary, the retromer recyclesRh1, prevents an overload of the endolysosomal pathway, andsalvages a substantial fraction of Rh1 from degradation in flies. Itmay also play a similar role in ipRGCs in the retina of vertebrates.ResultsVps26 Mutant PRs Display Light-Dependent PRDegenerationTo identify mutations that cause PR degeneration, wegenerated large mutant clones of essential genes in the eyes(Figure S1B) and screened for mutants that exhibit an age-dependent decrease in amplitude of electroretinogram (ERG)recordings [6,77,78]. Mutations in a complementation groupXE52, which we later mapped to Vps26 (Figure S2A), result in aprogressive loss of ERG amplitudes compared to the control(Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). Reduced amplitudes in ERGrecordings may result from aberrant PR development, a defectivephototransduction pathway, or PR degeneration [1]. To address ifthe ERG defects are due to aberrant PR development, weexamined the light response of dark-reared control (y w FRT19Aiso,the isogenized y w FRT19A flies, or iso; see Materials and Methods)and two Vps26 mutant alleles. Upon rearing the flies in the dark,the Vps261and Vps262mutants exhibit nearly normal ERGresponses and the ERG amplitude and on- and off-transients inVps261mutant PRs are slightly reduced when compared to control(Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). In addition, imaging of newlyeclosed flies (see definition in Materials and Methods) revealed thatthe overall morphology of ommatidia is similar to control,although loss of a rhabdomere is observed at low frequency inthe Vps261mosaic clones (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). Thesedata indicate that mutations in Vps26 do not significantly affect PRdevelopment, allowing nearly normal ERGs in young flies.To assess the impact of the Vps26 mutations in aged flies, weraised the animals either in a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, L = 1,800lux) or in constant darkness (DD) and recorded the ERGs at 0, 2,4, 10, and 21 d. In LD, both alleles show a loss of on- and off-transients, indicating a loss of synaptic transmission. They alsoexhibit a reduced depolarization by day 2, and a progressive loss ofthe ERG amplitude with age (Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). Atday 21, the light-induced PR depolarization in Vps261and Vps262mutant PRs is almost completely absent (Figure 1B\u2013C and FigureS1C). Strikingly, 3-wk-old DD-reared Vps261and Vps262mutantsexhibit nearly normal ERG responses, similar to newly eclosedflies (Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). The PR morphology ofVps261and Vps262mutants is severely affected in flies kept in LDfor 21 d (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). In addition, weconstructed an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (Vps26-gEGFP; see below and Figure S2A) that fully rescues the lethality(Figure S2B), ERG, and morphological defects of both Vps261andVps262alleles (Vps261GR in Figure 1B\u2013E; Vps262GR in Figure 1Cand S1C\u2013E). However, PR morphology is nearly wild-type whenthe flies are raised in DD (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). Insummary, PR degeneration in the Vps26 mutant clones is light-dependent.Author SummaryUpon light exposure, rhodopsins\u2014light-sensing proteinsin the eye\u2014trigger visual transduction signaling toactivate fly photoreceptor cells. After activation, rhodop-sins can be internalized from the cell surface intoendosomes and then degraded in lysosomes. This mech-anism prevents constant activation of the visual transduc-tion pathway, thereby maintaining the function andintegrity of photoreceptor cells. It is not known, however,whether these internalized rhodopsins can be recycled.Here, we show that the retromer, an evolutionarilyconserved protein complex, is required for the recyclingof rhodopsins. We find that loss of key retromer subunits(Vps35 or Vps26) causes rhodopsin mislocalization in thephotoreceptors and severe light-induced photoreceptordegeneration. Conversely, gain of retromer subunits canalleviate photoreceptor degeneration in some contexts.Human retromer components can stand in for depletedfruit fly retromer, suggesting that this complex plays a rolein recycling light sensors in both vertebrate and inverte-brate photoreceptors.The Retromer Complex Recycles RhodopsinPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847Mutations in XE52 Map to Vps26To identify the mutations in XE52 complementation groupconsisting of two alleles, we performed duplication, deficiency, andP[acman] rescue mapping (Yamamoto et al., in preparation),narrowing the locus to a 21 kb genomic region (Figure S2A). TheXE52 alleles fail to complement the lethality of P{EP}Vps26G2008(Figures S2A\u2013B, [79]), a transposable element inserted in the 59-UTR of the Vps26 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed mutations inconserved amino acid residues in both alleles: a nonsense mutation(K264*) and a missense mutation (V267D) in Vps261and Vps262,respectively (Figure 1F). To test if Vps26 is responsible for both thelethality and PR degenerative phenotypes in XE52 alleles, wegenerated the Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct mentionedabove (Figure S2A) as well as a UAS-Vps26 full-length cDNAconstruct [80]. Both the genomic rescue and ubiquitouslyexpressed cDNA (tub-Gal4.UAS-Vps26) rescue all phenotypes(Figure 1B\u2013E, Figure S1C\u2013E, Figure S2B, and unpublished data),confirming that the phenotypes are caused by loss of Vps26.Vps26 is a subunit of the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82]). Becauseloss of retromer function in Vps35 and Snx3 mutants has beenFigure 1. Loss of Vps26 in the eye causes PR degeneration.

Vps35 is one of the protein partners of Vps26 in the retromer. The arrestin-like domain of Vps26 and the a-solenoid domain of Vps35 are aligned with the human homologs. (B) ERG traces of control (iso) and Vps261mosaiceyes at day 0, kept in LD (light intensity = 1,800 lux) for 2, 10, and 21 d; Vps261rescued by an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (GR, Vps26-gEGFP) kept in LD for 21 d; and Vps261 kept in DD for 21 d. A UAS-RNAi against the w gene product is expressed in the eyes of the rescued animals(Vps261 GR or Vps262 GR) to remove red pigments. On- and off-transients disappear and the amplitude decreases upon 2 d in LD, but remainunchanged upon keeping the flies in DD for 3 wk. The loss of on- and off-transients and reduced depolarization can be fully rescued by the Vps26-gEGFP rescue construct. (C) Quantification of ERG amplitudes of flies kept in LD or DD.

We generated mutant clones of Vps261inwing discs of third instar larvae and observed a failure to secreteWg in the wing margin cells. Furthermore, we observedconcomitant loss of Senseless (Sens) expression, a downstreameffector of the Wingless pathway (Figure S2C, [83]). These dataconfirm the loss of retromer function in the Vps26 mutants.Vps26 Is Primarily Localized to Early and Late EndosomesThe subunits of the retromer complex have been shown toprimarily associate with endosomes in vertebrates [7\u20139]. However,the in vivo subcellular localization of the retromer in Drosophila hasnot been documented. We therefore raised a polyclonal antibodyagainst the full-length fly Vps26 protein (Figure S2D\u2013E) andcostained with antibodies against Avalanche (Avl, fly homolog ofSyntaxin 7, an early endosomal marker, [84]), Rab5 (an earlyendosomal marker, [85]), Rab7 (a late endosomal marker, [76]),Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI, an ER marker, [86]), GM130 (acis-Golgi marker, [87]), Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, a marker for thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), [88]), or Rab11 (a TGN or post-Golgisecretory vesicle marker, [31]). Vps26 shows substantially greatercolocalization with Avl, Rab5, and Rab7 than the ER, Golgi, andsecretory vesicle markers (Figure S2F\u2013G). This distribution is seenin both wing discs and adult PRs (Figure S2F\u2013G and unpublisheddata), indicating that Vps26 associates preferentially with early andlate endosomes in different tissues in vivo.Loss of Vps35 Causes PR DegenerationVps35 acts as a scaffolding protein and physically interacts withVps26 in the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82,89]). RNAi knockdownof vps35 has been shown to reduce Vps26 protein levels inHEK293 cells [13]. Consistent with work in cultured cells, we findthat mutant clones of the Vps35 null allele (Vps35MH20, [13]) in eyediscs cause a nearly complete loss of Vps26 (Figure 2A), showingthat the presence of Vps35 is required for Vps26 in vivo. Next, weperformed ERG recordings and bright field imaging on largemutant clones of Vps35MH20in flies aged for 0, 4, 10, and 21 d andexamined function and morphology of Vps35MH20mutant PRs. Asshown in Figure 2B\u2013C, the ERG phenotypes of Vps35MH20arevery similar to those of Vps26 shown in Figure 1. In addition,mutations in the two genes exhibit very similar morphologicaldefects in aged PRs (compare Figure 2D\u2013E with Figure 1D\u2013E andFigure S1D\u2013E). These results indicate that the retromer is requiredto maintain PR function and morphology. Loss of the retromertherefore leads to light-dependent PR degeneration.Sorting nexins can be involved in retromer-mediated proteintrafficking [7\u20139,90,91]. To test whether these proteins are involvedin the maintenance of PRs, we performed ERGs on Snx1d1andSnx3d1null alleles (Figure S3, [10]). Upon keeping the flies for 10 din LD, we did not observe a difference in ERG amplitudes ofSnx1d1or Snx3d1mutants (Figure S3A\u2013B), although we observed apartial loss of the on-transient in Snx3d1(Figure S3A,C). The dataindicate that these sorting nexins are not part of the complex orplay a minor role. In addition, we tested whether the WASH(Wiskott\u2013Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homolog) com-plex, a protein complex that has been shown to be required for thetransport of several retromer cargos in vertebrate cells and the flytracheal tubes [8,90,91], is involved in PR degeneration. As shownin Figure S4, RNAi-mediated loss of a subunit of the WASHcomplex, Washout (the single WASH ortholog in Drosophila, [92]),does not affect PR maintenance and function. Hence, the retromercan have different compositions in different cells.Loss of Retromer Subunits Leads to an Expansion of theEndolysosomal Compartments in PRsThe retromer retrieves membrane protein cargos from theendolysosomal pathway [7\u20139]. To assess whether endosomes andlysosomes are affected in the absence of the retromer, weperformed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and examinedthe ultrastructure of Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs. Vps261andVps35MH20flies raised in LD for 4 d show obvious ultrastructuraldefects (Figure 3B,D) in PRs when compared to control(Figure 3A). These defects include a dramatic increase in lateendosomes (inset 1 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and yellowarrowheads in Figure S5B,D; [93]) and lysosomes (inset 2 inFigure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and arrows in Figure S5B\u2013C,E; [94]).However, PRs of the dark-reared Vps261or Vps35MH20flies(Figure 3C,E\u2013F and Figure S6B\u2013E) do not show an increasednumber of late endosomes or lysosomes when compared to control(Figure 3A,F, Figure S5A, and Figure S6A). These data show thatthe endolysosomal pathway is severely affected in retromermutants upon light exposure.Internalized Rh1 Fails to Be Recycled from theEndolysosomal Pathway in Vps26 Mutant PRsTo address whether the trafficking of endocytosed Rh1 isaffected in the retromer mutants, we assessed Rh1 distribution inPRs that were exposed to light. Two protocols have been used forRh1 immunostaining in fly PRs: whole mount preparations [76]and eye sections [41]. Previously, we showed that the whole mountprotocol is more sensitive than staining of sections for Rh1 presentin the cell body, while sections are better than whole mountstaining for assessing Rh1 in rhabdomeres [6]. Here, we slightlymodified the whole mount protocol to increase Rh1 signals in thePR cell body by treating the tissues with higher concentrations ofTriton X-100. As shown in Figure S7, Rh1 signals are obviouslyenhanced upon increasing Triton X-100 concentration (toppanels) compared to low Triton X-100 treatment (bottom panels).Here, we use the high Triton X-100 protocol for our immuno-staining assays.As previously reported [6,76], immunostaining of Rh1 in dark-reared wild-type control PRs reveals a typical crescent-shapedstaining pattern at the base of the rhabdomeres, due to the denselystacked rhabdomeric membranes that do not permit antibodypenetration in whole mount preparations (Figure 4A, top panels).Similar to this control, we observed that the distribution(Figure 4A, top panels) and levels (Figure 5A\u2013B) of Rh1 are notaffected in Vps261mutants prior to light exposure. These data arein agreement with the observation that dark-reared Vps261mutants exhibit nearly normal ERGs and PR morphology(Figure 1B\u2013E). Upon a 12-h light exposure, Rh1 is internalizedin both control and Vps261mutant PRs, as shown by the dramaticincrease in Rh1 levels in the PR cell bodies (Figure 4A, middlepanels). This increase in Rh1 is not due to the changes in levels ofRh1 (unpublished data), but rather because Rh1 becomesthose in DD at the indicated time points.

Inaddition, this light exposure is not pathological as control fliesexhibit normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure S8). However,upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body isrestored to the original levels in control but not in Vps261PRs(Figure 4A, bottom panels). Similarly, although less obvious, wealso observed Rh1 accumulation in Vps261mutant PRs upon lightexposure in the sectioned eye samples (Figure S9). Hence, the Rh1subcellular localization is altered in Vps261mutants.To assess where in the cell body Rh1 accumulates in Vps261mutants, we transiently exposed the flies to light and monitoredthe subcellular localization of Rh1 using markers. We brieflyexposed the flies to blue light for 20 min followed by 5-minexposure to orange light (Figure 4B) to acutely induce endocytosisof a small amount of Rh1. This light condition is not pathologicalas the ERG responses and morphology of control PRs are normal(Figure S8). Upon recovery in the dark for 4 h, Rh1 can bedetected in very bright punctae that often colocalize with Rab7 orLamp1::GFP, a marker for lysosomes [95], in Vps261PRs(Figure 4B\u2013C), implicating that Rh1 is trapped in the endolyso-somal compartments.Rh1 retention in the endolysosomal pathway in Vps261mutantsupon an acute light exposure may be due to reduced Rh1recycling and/or decreased lysosomal degradation. If Rh1recycling is decreased, one would expect a reduction in Rh1levels in Vps261mutants compared to controls upon light exposureas an increased amount of internalized Rh1 will be delivered tolysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, if Rh1 degradationin lysosomes is impaired, one would predict that Rh1 abundance iselevated in Vps26 mutant PRs when compared to controls exposedto light. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we exposedthe dark-raised flies to white light (1,800 lux) for 16 h. Prior to thislight exposure, the Rh1 levels are similar in control and Vps261mutants (Figure 5A\u2013B), indicating that Rh1 expression is notaffected in Vps261mutants. Upon a 16-h exposure to white light,Rh1 levels in Vps261mutant PRs are significantly decreased whencompared to control (Figure 5A\u2013B). Reduced Rh1 levels in Vps261mutants upon light exposure do not appear to be due to impairedRh1 synthesis as the Rh1 levels are restored after 6-h recovery inthe dark (Figure 5A\u2013B). Moreover, the ERG responses of Vps261mutants are not affected upon this light exposure (Figure 5C\u2013D).The data indicate that, in the absence of Vps26, lysosomes are ableFigure 3.

Internalized Rh1 accumulates in late endosomes in Vps26 mutants. (A) Rh1 is aberrantly distributed in Vps261 mutants. Dark-reared control (iso) or Vps261 mutants were kept in the dark, exposed to whole-spectrum light for 12 h, or exposed to light for 12 h and recovered inthe dark for 6 h. Both dark-reared control and Vps261 mutant PRs show a normal Rh1 distribution, which is characterized by the crescent-shaped Rh1staining pattern surrounding rhabdomeres (marked by F-actin) (top panels). The localization of Rh1 in the shape of a crescent around therhabdomeres is due to the dense packing of membranes in rhabdomeres. Upon a 12-h light exposure, both genotypes show increased Rh1 proteinlevels in PR cell body (middle panels) as some Rh1 is endocytosed. However, upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is higherin Vps261than that in wild-type PRs (bottom panels). Scale bar, 2 mm.

Rh1 internalization is induced by a 20-min blue light (BL)pulse followed by a 5-min orange light (OL) exposure to inactivate Rh1. Subsequently, the flies are kept in the dark for 4 h to allow Rh1 delivery toendosomal compartments. An w RNAi is ectopically expressed in the eyes of the Lamp1::GFP-expressing control or Vps261 flies. Fly PRs are stainedwith phalloidin (to mark F-actin), Rh1, Rab7, or GFP.

However, chronic light exposure (LD for severaldays) severely affects the endolysosomal system (Figure 3 andFigure S5) because accumulated Rh1 in endosomes and/orlysosomes persistently challenges the endolysosomal system [2].To examine whether the retromer is recruited to Rh1 punctaeupon endocytosis in the PRs, we performed colocalization studiesof Vps26 and Rh1. In the dark, Rh1 and Vps26 signals do notoverlap (Figure 5E). In contrast, numerous Rh1 punctae colocalizewith Vps26 in the PR cell body upon transient light exposure(Figure 5E). These data indicate that endocytosed Rh1 is a cargoof the retromer.Reducing Endocytosis or Rh1 Levels Suppresses PRDegeneration in Vps26 MutantsIf PR degeneration in retromer mutants is caused by aberrantaccumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway, reducing theamount of endocytosed Rh1 or the abundance of Rh1 itself maysuppress PR degenerative phenotypes. Dynamin (encoded by theshi gene) is required for Rh1 endocytosis upon light exposure [73].shits1, a temperature-sensitive dynamin allele, encodes a mutantprotein that is functional at 18uC but loses its function at elevatedtemperature [96]. Although impaired dynamin function leads todeath of adult animals at 26uC or higher temperature (unpub-lished data), shits1mutant flies are viable and do not exhibit ERGdefects at 24uC (Figure 6A\u2013B). This permits us to conditionallyreduce dynamin function in adult flies without impairing theirlight response. To address whether internalization of Rh1 iscritical for the PR degeneration in Vps261flies, we raised theVps261,shits1double mutants at 18uC and shifted the newly eclosedflies to 24uC to decrease dynamin function. We then performedERGs on Vps261,shits1double mutants kept in LD (Figure 6A). Asshown in Figure 6A\u2013B, reducing dynamin function significantlysuppresses the loss in ERG amplitude in Vps261mutants at day 4in LD, indicating that Rh1 endocytosis plays an important role inPR degeneration upon loss of retromer function.To address if a reduction in Rh1 suppresses the demise of thePRs, we tested flies that lack one copy of the Rh1 gene. Stronghypomorphic or null Rh1 alleles impair rhabdomere developmentin homozygous animals, as Rh1 plays a key signaling role inmaintaining the structure of rhabdomeres [97,98]. However, fliesthat are heterozygous for Rh1 loss-of-function alleles do not showaberrant PR development even when the Rh1 protein levelsare reduced by 50% (Figure S10 and [50]). To assess whethera reduction of 50% in Rh1 levels is able to suppress theVps26-associated PR degenerative phenotypes, we tested ERGsin mutants that carry a single copy of the Rh1 null allele (ninaE17,[99]). As shown in Figure 6C\u2013D, flies that carry a single copy ofRh1 exhibit a significant suppression of the ERG defects seen inVps261mutant flies that have been kept in LD for 4 d.To strongly reduce Rh1 levels, we next raised Vps261mutantson low vitamin A containing fly food. Vitamin A is a dietaryprecursor of 11-cis 3-hydroxyretinal, the chromophore that iscovalently linked to the Rh1 opsin [100]. A decrease in vitamin Aleads to loss of the chromophore. Because the chromophore isessential for Rh1 folding and stability [39,101], absence of vitaminA leads to reduced Rh1 levels in flies. Although this manipulationstill allows the formation of rhabdomeres, the size is dramaticallyreduced due to the requirement of Rh1 as a major structuralcomponent [102]. Indeed, a reduction in dietary vitamin A leadsto diminished rhabdomere size in both control and Vps261mutants. Remarkably, vitamin A deprivation leads to a verystrong suppression of the PR degeneration observed in Vps261mutants at day 10 in LD (Figure 6E\u2013F). In addition, the reducedERG amplitudes of Vps261are strongly suppressed upon vitamin Adeprivation (Figure 6G). In summary, decreasing Rh1 levelssuppresses the retinal degeneration associated with Vps261. Thisalso suggests that elevated levels of Rh1 trapped in theendolysosomal pathway, rather than alterations in the levels ofRh1 in the rhabdomeres per se, underlie PR degeneration in Vps261mutants.Increased Levels of Vps35 or Vps26 Are Sufficient toSuppress PR DegenerationRh1 accumulation in late endosomes causes PR degenera-tion in flies that lack PLC activity (encoded by the no receptorpotential A (norpA) gene, [76,103]) (Figure 7A). If the retromerretrieves Rh1 from endosomes, increasing retromer levelsmight alleviate PR degeneration in norpA flies. We thereforeoverexpressed the fly Vps35 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps35,UAS-wRNAi) or Vps26 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps26,UAS-w RNAi) in nor-pAP24mutants. Upon continuous exposure to white light for6 d, norpAP24mutants exhibit reduced numbers of rhabdomerescompared to control flies (Figure 7B, left and middle left panelsand Figure 7C). In addition, the ommatidia organization isoften aberrant in norpAP24mutants (Figure 7B, middle leftpanel), indicating that the PRs are undergoing a progressivedemise. Expression of Vps35 or Vps26 significantly restoresrhabdomere numbers (Figure 7B, middle right and right paneland Figure 7C), suggesting that this manipulation is sufficientFigure 6. Decreasing Rh1 levels suppresses PR degeneration in Vps26 mutants. (A) Decreasing endocytosis with a temperature-sensitivedynamin mutation (shits) suppresses ERG defects associated with the loss of Vps26. Animals were grown at 18uC in the dark. Newly eclosed flies wereselected and kept in the dark for an additional 12 h at 24uC to reduce dynamin function in shits1 or Vps261,shits1. Subsequently, flies are shifted to LDor kept in DD at 24uC. ERG is performed at the end of the fourth LD cycle. shits1 flies exhibit a normal ERG response. ERG defects in Vps261 mutant PRsare suppressed when dynamin function is partially reduced, as the Vps261,shits1 double mutants show a stronger depolarization than that in Vps261.(B) Quantification of ERG amplitude of the flies tested in (A).

Decreasing vitA lowers the levels ofretinal, which is required for Rh1 maturation [39]. Loss of retinal therefore leads to loss of Rh1. Bright field images show that PR degeneration isstrongly suppressed in Vps261mutants raised on the low vitA\u2013containing food when flies are kept in LD for 10 d. As vitA is a key component for Rh1maturation and Rh1 is a key structural component of rhabdomeres, the rhabdomere size is much reduced when the flies were raised on low vitAfood.

Inaddition, expression of human Vps26B also suppresses thenorpAP24phenotypes (unpublished data). These data indicatethat rerouting some of the Rh1 slated for lysosomal degrada-tion delays PR degeneration.Mutations that impair lysosomal function can also lead toRh1-induced PR degeneration [76]. We therefore assessedwhether increasing Vps35 or Vps26 expression suppresses PRdegeneration in mutants that affect a subunit of the AP-3complex. AP-m3, encoded by carmine (cm), is required for theproper biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles [104]. Upon6 d of light exposure, cm1mutant PRs showed degenerativefeatures [76], including loss of rhabdomeres and disruption ofthe ommatidia organization (Figure 7D, bottom left panel andFigure 7E). In addition, cm1mutant PRs exhibit decreasedERG amplitudes (Figure 7F\u2013G). Similar to norpAP24mutants,increasing Vps35 or Vps26 in cm1mutants restores the numberof rhabdomeres (Figure 7D\u2013E) and suppresses ERG defects(Figure 7F\u2013G). These data indicate that increased retromerfunction can not only prevent PR degeneration in mutants withimpaired late endosomal trafficking but also suppress PRdegeneration caused by defective lysosomal function.Vertebrate Retromer HomologsBecause the genes that encode the retromer proteins areevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]), we investigatedwhether the vertebrate Vps26 and Vps35 may also function inthe visual system. As shown in Figure S11A, vps26A is expressedin the mouse retina based on Northern blots. In addition, westained the retina of wild-type control or heterozygous micecontaining a lacZ inserted in the vps35 gene [105]. Most of themelanopsin-expressing ipRGCs (92%) also express b-GAL(Figure S11B). To test whether human Vps26 homologs cansubstitute for the function of fly Vps26 in PRs, we ubiquitouslyexpressed the human vps26A or vps26B cDNA in the Vps261mutant background. Both human Vps26A and Vps26B were ableto rescue the lethality of Vps261mutant flies (Figure 8A\u2013D). Wealso recorded ERGs from adult flies kept in LD for 21 d. Asshown in Figure 8A\u2013B, we observed a full rescue of the loss ofERG amplitude and on\u2013off transients. In addition, PR degen-eration in Vps261mutants is fully suppressed by overexpressinghuman Vps26 proteins (Figure 8C\u2013D). These results show thatthe human Vps26 homologs are able to perform the samefunction as the fly Vps26 protein.DiscussionThe Retromer Complex Is Required for Maintenance ofFly PRsThe retromer recycles specific proteins from endosomes to theTGN or plasma membrane [7\u20139]. Here we show that, althoughthe loss of the retromer does not obviously affect eye development,mutations in Vps26 or Vps35 genes lead to strong light-dependentPR degeneration (Figure 1B\u2013E, Figure 2B\u2013E, and Figure S1C\u2013E).The demise of Vps261and Vps35MH20PRs is associated with asignificant increase in the number of late endosomes andlysosomes upon light exposure (Figure 3 and Figure S5), showingthat the endolysosomal pathway is strongly affected when Rh1recycling by the retromer is impaired. Indeed, Rh1 accumulates inlate endosomes or lysosomes in the mutant PRs (Figure 4B\u2013C).Although Rh1 can be degraded and the function of Vps261mutantPRs is not abolished upon short light exposure (Figure 5A\u2013D),chronic exposure to light is detrimental to Vps261mutants becausepersistent Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal pathway istoxic to PR cells [71,75,76]. Hence, reducing Rh1 endocytosis orRh1 levels in the rhabdomeres suppresses PR degeneration uponprolonged light exposure (Figure 6). Interestingly, increasingVps35 or Vps26 in mutants that show PR degeneration due toRh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal compartments [76]suppresses the degenerative phenotypes (Figure 7). In summary,the retromer is required to retrieve Rh1 from endosomes tomaintain PR function and integrity (Figure 8E).How does Rh1 internalization affect the endolysosomalpathway in retromer mutants? One possibility is that lysosomesin the mutants are unable to cope with the increased levels ofinternalized Rh1 over time as Rh1 is one of the most abundantproteins in PRs [106,107]. This in turn triggers an increase in thenumber of lysosomes (Figures 3B,D,F and Figure S5B\u2013C,E), theaccumulation of aberrant lysosomes (Figure S5C), and theaccumulation of endolysosomal intermediates, including lateendosomes (Figure 3B,D,F and Figure S5B,D). Alternatively, lossof the retromer may increase the flux in the endolysosomalpathway, which overpowers the rate of endolysosomal maturationand leads to an adaptive response that eventually leads to theexpansion of these compartments. Both pathways can lead to anapparent accumulation of Rh1 in the cell body when stained andanalyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 and Figure S9).Defective regulation of Rh1 can lead to the demise of PRs viaapoptosis [72,108]. Does apoptosis play a critical role in the PRFigure 7. Increasing the levels of Vps35 or Vps26 suppresses PR degeneration associated with PLC and AP-m3 mutants.

We argue that this is not thecase based on the following observations. First, the retromermutants exhibit progressive PR degeneration over a 3-wk period(Figure 1B\u2013C, Figure 2B\u2013C, and Figure S1C\u2013E), whereasapoptosis typically occurs within hours [109]. Second, mutantsthat lead to PR loss via apoptosis lose most PRs within ommatidiaby the engulfment of surrounding glial cells [110]. However, thedegenerating Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs are not removed,although their morphology is very severely disrupted. Indeed, theycan still be identified in 3-wk-old flies (Figure 1D, Figure 2D,Figure 8C, and Figure S1D), indicating a lack of engulfment bysurrounding cells [111]. Third, overexpressing p35, a pan-caspaseinhibitor of apoptosis [108], fails to suppress the PR degenerationin Vps26 mutants upon light exposure (unpublished data). Indeed,Rh1 accumulation in different subcellular compartments triggersdifferent cellular responses, which leads to PR degeneration ofvarying severity [2]. Accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomalpathway seems particularly toxic to PRs but often does not causethe removal of PRs for many weeks.Loss of Wg affects eye development [112], whereas loss ofCrumbs leads to short and/or fused rhabdomeres [113,114].Although the retromer can recycle Wls or Crumbs in some flytissues [10\u201314,17,18], Vps261or Vps35MH20mutants do not exhibitobvious eye developmental defects. It is therefore very likely thatthe composition of the eye retromer is different from the wingretromer. Indeed, loss of Snx3 does not cause obvious degener-ative phenotypes when compared to loss of Vps26 or Vps35(compare Figure S3 with Figures 1 and 2), yet these proteins are allessential for the recycling of Wls and wing development [10\u201314].The Retromer in Photosensitive Cells in Flies andVertebratesMany players required for phototransduction in Drosophila areconserved in a phototransduction cascade in vertebrate ipRGCs.These include melanopsin, PLC, and the TRP channels [60\u201363].This phototransduction pathway plays a role in photoentrainmentof circadian rhythms [64\u201367] and the control of the pupillary lightreflex [64,68,69]. We find that vps35 is expressed in 92% of themelanopsin-expressing RGCs in the mouse retina (Figure S11B).This may be an underestimate due to technical difficulties with b-GAL immunostaining in mouse tissues. In addition, the humanVps26 proteins are able to substitute for the function of the flyhomolog in PRs (Figure 8A\u2013D). Because vertebrate melanopsinhas very similar photochemical properties to fly rhodopsin[115,116], the retromer may play a conserved role in vertebrateipRGCs. As deletion of vps35 leads to early embryonic lethality[105], a vps35 conditional KO in ipRGCs will need to beestablished to address its role in ipRGCs.Implications of the Retromer Complex in HumanNeurodegenerative DiseasesThe retromer has been implicated in human neurodegenerativedisease, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and PD [19,20,117].In AD, a retromer deficiency has been proposed to affectsubcellular distribution of b-secretase, which leads to increasedamyloid-beta (Ab) deposits and defective neuronal function[105,118]. In PD, a missense mutation in VPS35 (D620N) hasbeen shown to cause an autosomal dominant late onset form of thedisease [19,20]. The Vps35 D620N mutant protein appears tofunction as a dominant negative, and Vps35 and LRRK2(Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) have been shown to interact[119]. It will therefore be interesting to assess if these mutantsaffect ipRGCs as PD patients often have sleep issues [120].Materials and MethodsFly Strains and GeneticsVps261and Vps262alleles were isolated as described [6,78].Male large duplications (,1\u20132 Mb) covering the X chromosome[121] were crossed with female y,w,mut*,P{neoFRT}19Aisogenizedfliesthat were balanced with FM7c,Kr-GAL4,UAS-GFP(Kr.GFP). Forthe XE52 group, the lethality of alleles was rescued byDp(1;Y)y267g19.2 (1A1;2B17-18 + 20A3;20Fh). XE52 allelescomplemented all the available deficiencies covered byDp(1;Y)y267g19.2 [122,123]. Therefore, we turned to cross theXE52 alleles with 80 kb P[acman] duplications that cover the gapsamong deficiencies [124] and found three overlapping duplica-tions (Dp(1;3)DC446, Dp(1;3)DC033, and Dp(1;3)DC034) thatrescued the lethality of the mutants. These P[acman] duplicationsshare a ,21 kb interval. We then performed PCR sequencing forgenes localized to this region and identified mutations in Vps26. Alethal insertion P{EP}Vps26G2008in Vps26 failed to complementboth XE52 alleles.Rh117[84], shits1[81], y,w,GMR-hid,cl,P{neoFRT}19A [125],norpAP24[65], cm1[89], w1118[126], UAS-w RNAi [127], andGMR-w-RNAi13D[128] were obtained from the BloomingtonDrosophila Stock Center (BDSC). Vps35MH20is a gift from John-Paul Vincent [13]; Snx1d1and Snxd3are gifts from Xinhua Lin[10]; UAS-Lamp1::GFP is a gift from Helmut Kra\u0308mer [95]; and theUAS-GFP RNAi is a gift from Norbert Perrimon [129]. UAS-RNAi stocks against the wash or wls genes were obtained fromthe Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC). shits1was usedto generate the y,w,Vps261,shits1,P{neoFRT}19A recombinant,whereas the GMR-w-RNAi13Dwas used to generate the y,w,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A and y,w,Vps261,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A recombinants.For ERG, bright field, and TEM experiments, y,w,Vps261,P{neoFRT}19A/FM7c, Kr.GFP, or y,w,Vps262,P{neoFRT}19A/FM7c,Kr.GFP females were crossed with cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y),y+,v+[130]; ey-FLP males, whereas w ; Vps35MH20,P{neoFRT}42D/CyO females were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ ; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}42D males. w; Snx1d1, P{neoFRT}FRT40Aand w; Snx3d1, P{neoFRT}FRT82B mutants were crossed withy,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}40A and y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; w+,cl, P{neoFRT}82B, respectively.

(E) Model: the retromer recycles Rh1 in fly PRs. In the absence of the retromer, endocytosed Rh1 is trapped in the endolysosomalcompartments upon a short-term light exposure and an increased amount of endocytosed Rh1 is degraded. However, upon chronic light exposure,persistent Rh1 accumulation leads to an expansion of late endosomes and lysosomes. Imbalanced Rh1 homeostasis in the endolysosomal pathway inturn stresses PR cells, causing PR degeneration.doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847.g008The Retromer Complex Recycles RhodopsinPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 14 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y)901 males were crossed with ubi-GFP,cl,FRT19A ; hh-GAL4,UAS-FLP [13] females to generate largemutant clones in the posterior region.

For tissue sections, wefixed fly tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated the tissueswith acetone, and embedded them in LR white resin (ElectronMicroscopy Sciences). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. Antibodies were used at the followingconcentrations: rabbit anti-Rab5 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-Avl[84], 1:500; rabbit anti-Rab7 [76], 1:500; mouse anti-PDI(abcam), 1:100; rabbit anti-GM130 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-Rab11 (abcam, [6]), 1:500; chicken anti-GFP (abcam), 1:1,000;mouse anti-Rh1 [4C5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank(DSHB)], 1:50; mouse anti-Wash (P3H3, [131]), 1:20; guinea piganti-Vps26, 1:1,000 (this study); biotin-conjugated PNA (VectorLabs), 1:1,000; Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen),1:100; and Alexa 405-, Alexa 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugatedsecondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:600.Western BlottingFly heads were homogenized in 16 Laemmli sample buffer(Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).Tissue samples were loaded into 10% gels, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).Antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-actin (ICN Biomedicals),1:2,500; mouse anti-Rh1 (4C5, DSHB), 1:1,000; and rabbit anti-TRP [58].Molecular BiologyCloning.

A C9-terminal V5 tag was designed in-frame with Vps26. The Vps26The Retromer Complex Recycles RhodopsinPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 15 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847PCR product and the pUAST-attB vector were digested with EagI(NEB) and XbaI (NEB). T4 ligase (NEB) was used to ligate the flyVps26 PCR products with pUAST-attB vector. Full-length flyVps35 cDNA was cloned from a plasmid (SD03023 from BDGP)using primers 59-CTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGTATCCCTG-GAGCTCC-39 and 59-TTCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTG-GGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTGAGAGTTATGCCCG-39. AC-terminal HA tag was added to Vps35. Vps35 PCR productwas digested with XhoI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated withthe pUAST-attB vector. Full-length human vps26A and vps26Bwere cloned from plasmids (HsCD00296497 and HsCD00076427,respectively) (Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University). Thefollowing primers were used for PCR cloning: for hvps26A, 59-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTT-39and 59-GCATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGT-ATGGGTACATTTCAGGCTGTTCGGCAG-39; for hvps26B,59-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGCTTCTTCGGCTTCGG-39 and 59-GAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCG-TATGGGTACTGCCTGCAGTTGTTGTCAG-39. A C-termi-nal HA tag was added to human vps26 isoforms. PCR productswere digested with EcoRI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated withpUAST-attB vectors. Fly Vps26::V5 and Vps35::HA and humanvps26A::HA and vps26B::HA cDNA constructs were purified andinjected into y,w,WC31 ; VK33 (fly cDNAs) or y,w,WC31 ; VK37embryos (human cDNAs), and the transgenic flies were selected.Genomic tagging. Recombineering was performed to tagEGFP at the C-terminus of the Vps26 gene. We used primers 59-GCAATTACGCCCAATACGAAAAAGACCGGTGCAACGC-CGTTGGCCACCGATGCAGCCCAATTCCGATCATATT-C-39 and 59-GTTACTACTTATCCCCCTGAAGATGGAAA-TCCTCTCCAGCTTCCCACTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCG-TCCATG-39 to amplify a PCR product containing the EGFP tagfrom the PL452-EGFP template vector [132]. We then electro-porated the EGFP-tagged PCR products into DY380 bacteria,which had been previously transformed with a 20 kb P[acman]genomic rescue construct that covers the entire Vps26 genomiclocus (clone CH322-92A18 from the BACPAC Resources Center,[133]). Recombineering and related procedures were performedaccording to the standard protocol [132]. Vps26-gEGFP\u2013taggedgenomic construct was injected into y,w,WC31 ; VK31 embryos,and the transgenic flies were selected.Generation of Anti-Fly Vps26 AntibodyFull-length fly Vps26 cDNA was cloned from LD29140 by PCRwith primers 59-CTTGGATCCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTC-GGCCA-39 and 59-CTGGCGGCCGCTCAATCGGTGGC-CAACGGC-39. PCR products were then digested with BamHI(NEB) and NotI (NEB) and ligated with a pET28a(+) vectorcontaining a Hisx6 tag at the N9-terminus (Novagen). The Vps26-pET28a(+) construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysSbacteria (Invitrogen). Expression of Hisx6-Vps26 was inducedwith 0.5 mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich),and the recombinant protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column(Qiagen) and inoculated into guinea pigs to generate polyclonalantibodies (Cocalico Biological Inc.).Light/Dark Cycle and Blue-Orange Light ExposureIn general, mosaic flies were grown in the dark at 25uC, and thenewly eclosed flies were selected and shifted to a 12-h light/darkcycle (LD, 1,800 lux in the light cycle) or constant darkness (DD) at25uC for the indicated periods. In the shits suppressor assay,animals were raised in the dark at 18uC to avoid reduced dynaminprotein function. Newly eclosed flies were then shifted to 24uC inthe dark for 12 h. Flies were then kept in LD or DD at 24uC. Foraging experiments, flies were flipped to new vials every 3 d tomaintain food conditions, and the positions of the vials wererandomly shuffled to normalize light exposure. For pulse-chaseassays, flies were kept in a box with a blue LED [6] for 20 min andthen an orange LED for 5 min.Low Vitamin A\u2013Containing FoodLow vitamin A\u2013containing food was made according to [134].In brief, a solution containing 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02%cholesterol, and 2% agar was microwaved and poured into flyvials. After drying at room temperature overnight, fresh lowvitamin A food was used for experiments.TEM and Bright Field ImagingTo prepare fly retina samples for TEM and bright field imaging,fly heads were dissected and fixed at 4uC in 4% paraformalde-hyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.005%CaCl2 (PH 7.2) overnight; postfixed in 1% OsO4; dehydrated inethanol and propylene oxide; and then embedded in Embed-812resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with vacuum attachments.PRs were then sectioned and stained in 4% uranyl acetate and2.5% lead nitrate. TEM images of PR sections were taken using aJEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope with an AMTXR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera, while bright fieldpictures were captured using the Zeiss Imager.Z2 light microscopewith an AxioCamMRm digital camera. The morphology andquantity of rhabdomeres, endosomes, and lysosomes weredetermined in Image J.ERGsERG recordings were performed as described [6]. Briefly, adultflies were glued to a glass slide, a recording probe was placed onthe surface of the eye, and a reference probe was inserted in thethorax. A 1-s flash of white light was given, and the response wasrecorded and analyzed using the AXONTM-pCLAMPH8 software.Mouse Retina cDNA Preparation and Northern BlotAnalysisMouse retina cDNA was prepared as described [135]. vps26Awas PCR-amplified using primers 59-GAGTTTTCTTGGAGG-CTTTTTTGGTCC-39 and 59-TTACATCTCAGGCTGCTC-CGCAGAGG-39 and a 30 ng cDNA template. The PCR productwas cloned into pBluescript by blunt-end ligation and verified bysequencing. DNA probes were generated from gel-purified insert(excised with EcoRI and HindIII) by random-prime labeling with[a-32P]dCTP using the DECAprimeII kit (Ambion). Unincorpo-rated nucleotides were removed with a MicroBio-Spin 30 column(Bio-Rad).For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared fromretinas of 3\u20134-mo-old CD-1 mice by homogenization in TRIreagent (Ambion) using a motorized pestle and passagethrough a 20-gauge needle, extraction with 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane, and purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).We resolved 10 mg of total RNA on a formaldehyde-agarosegel and transferred it to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GEHealthcare) by capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybrid-ized in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 1 h, then incubated at 42uCovernight with a ,2.56107 cpm denatured probe diluted inULTRAhyb. Blots were washed several times in 26SSC+0.1%SDS and several times in 0.16 SSC+0.1% SDS. Washes wereperformed at 42\u201345uC. For imaging, blots were exposed to astorage phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon (GEHealthcare).The Retromer Complex Recycles RhodopsinPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 16 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847b-Gal and Melanopsin Detection in Mouse RetinaFor immunohistochemistry, wild-type or vps35 lacZ KI [105]mouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for45 min, washed in PBS, then stored overnight in 30% sucrose inPBS. The cornea and lens were removed, and eyecups wereembedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and flash-frozen. Cryosectionedretina were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 16PBS for 10 minand stained with the indicated antibodies: chicken anti\u2013b-GAL(abcam, 1:1,000) and rabbit a-melanopsin (Advanced TargetingSystems, 1:5,000).

Immuno-staining of Wg and Sens were performed to measure Winglesssignaling capacity. GFP marks wild-type control tissue. In Vps261clones, Wg accumulates in the Wg-producing cells, and neighbor-ing Sens expression is lost. (D) Immunostaining of Vps26 proteinin mosaic wing discs of third instar larvae using an anti-fly Vps26polyclonal antibody shows that it specifically recognizes Vps26.The Vps261mutant clones are generated in the posterior wing discusing hh-GAL4 and UAS-FLP. Wild-type control cells are markedwith GFP. The antibody recognizes Vps26 punctae in thecytoplasm of wild-type cells, but no signal is observed in mutantcells. Scale bar, 10 mm. (E) Immunostaining of anti-Vps26 andanti-GFP in wing imaginal discs of third instar Vps26-gEGFPtransgenic animals.
