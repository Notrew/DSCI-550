Despite the standard therapy for advanced disease including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the mortalityrate remains high for these patients. Hence, novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Here we examined theanticancer activity of a novel plant-derived compound, sparstolonin B (SsnB; 8,59-dihydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocou-marin) using neuroblastoma cell lines of different genetics. SsnB was recently isolated from an aquatic Chinese herb,Sparganium stoloniferum, and tubers of this herb have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment ofseveral inflammatory diseases and cancers. Our cell viability and morphological analysis indicated that SsnB at 10 mMconcentration significantly inhibited the growth of both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2), NGP, and IMR-32 cells) and N-mycnonamplified (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells) neuroblastoma cells. The flow cytometric analyses suggested that SsnB arrests thecell cycle progression at G2-M phase in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Exposure of SsnB inhibited the compact spheroidformation and reduced the tumorigenicity of SH-SY5Y cells and SK-N-BE(2) cells in in vitro 3-D cell culture assays(anchorage-independent colony formation assay and hanging drop assay). SsnB lowers the cellular level of glutathione(GSH), increases generation of reactive oxygen species and activates the cleavage of caspase-3 whereas co-incubation of aGSH precursor, N-acetylcysteine, along with SsnB attenuates the inhibitory effects of SsnB and increases the neuroblastomacell viability. Our results for the first time demonstrate that SsnB possesses anticancer activity indicating that SsnB-inducedreactive oxygen species generation promotes apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background.Thus these data suggest that SsnB can be a promising drug candidate in neuroblastoma therapy.Citation: Kumar A, Fan D, DiPette DJ, Singh US (2014) Sparstolonin B, a Novel Plant Derived Compound, Arrests Cell Cycle and Induces Apoptosis in N-MycAmplified and N-Myc Nonamplified Neuroblastoma Cells.

In vivo and in vitro studies revealed its anti-inflammatory [1,2] and anti-angiogenic [3] properties. SsnB actsas an antagonist to Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4),and exhibits anti-inflammatory property by selectively inhibitingTLR2 and TLR4-triggered inflammatory response in mouse andhuman macrophages [1,2]. In traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), the tubers of this herb have been used for the treatmentof several inflammatory diseases, and the crude extract preparedform this herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4\u20136]. As revealed by NMR and X-ray crystallography, SsnB (8,59-dyhydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocoumarin) is a polyphenol withstructural similarities to isocoumarins and xanthone. Isocoumarinsand xanthone family of compounds are well known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties [7\u201310]. Due to thestructural similarities of SsnB with isocoumarins and xanthone, wedecided to examine the anticancerous properties of SsnB.Neuroblastoma is a malignant pediatric cancer of the postgan-glionic sympathetic nervous system and derived from the neuralcrest cells during embryonic development. Initially it develops inthe adrenal gland and metastasizes to liver, bone, bone marrow,lymph nodes, neck and chest. It is the most common cancer inbabies younger than one and second most common tumor inchildren [11,12]. It accounts for 7% of all childhood cancers(Cancer Facts & Figures 2013. Atlanta, GA: American CancerSociety, 2013), and is responsible for 15% of all cancer deaths inchildren younger than 15 years. About 30%\u201350% of children withhigh-risk neuroblastoma experience long-term survival.Neuroblastoma tumor comprises of various heterogeneouspopulation of cells which differ at morphological, biochemicaland genetic levels [13\u201315]. Genomic amplification of N-myc gene,rearrangement or deletion of distal region of the chromosome 1(1p31-arm) [16,17] or alterations in chromosomes 11, 14 and 17[18,19] are most common cytogenetic features identified in low toPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0096343&domain=pdfadvance stages of neuroblastomas. Mutations in tumor suppressergenes, i.e., p53, retinoblastoma, RET, p16, p18 or p27 have beenreported to promote tumorigenesis [20\u201322]. These karyotype andcytogenetic alterations render tumors resistant to availablechemotherapies [23]. For example, retinoic acid induces neuronaldifferentiation in neuroblastoma cells [24,25] and commonly usedas in residual therapy. However, neuroblastoma cells with N-mycamplified oncogene do not respond to retinoic acid [26,27].Therefore, it is crucial to find new therapeutic agents that canexhibit anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells irrespectiveof their genetic abnormalities.In the present study, for the first time we have reported theanticancer activity of SsnB and have demonstrated that SsnBinhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma cells of differentgenetic background by arresting cell cycle progression and byinducing apoptotic cell death through generation of reactiveoxygen species.Materials and MethodsHuman Neuroblastoma Cell Culture and SsnB TreatmentsHuman neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, SK-N-BE(2) and SKNF-1 cells) were obtained from The American TypeCulture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA), and NGP cells werekind gift from Garrett M. Brodeur (The Children\u2019s Hospital ofPhiladelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) [28]. All cell lines weremaintained in complete Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 16 antibiotic-antimycotic solution (containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/mlstreptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B), and grown at 37uCin a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Stock solution of SsnBwas prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells treated withdifferent concentrations of SsnB in DMEM with 10% FBS weregrown for subsequent days. Cells treated with equal volume ofDMSO were used as control.Cell Viability AssayThe viability of SsnB-treated cells was determined by MTTassay following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche diagnosticscorporation, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, cells (16104 cells/well)grown in 96-well cell culture plate were incubated with SsnB in100 ml of complete culture medium with 10% FBS. Aftertreatments, cells were incubated with 10 ml of MTT reagent for4 h and then incubated overnight in solubilization buffer (100 ml)at 37uC. Absorbance of the formazan product was read at 575 nmin spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,CA). A reference wavelength of 690 nm was used to detectbackground. The measured absorption directly correlates with thenumber of viable cells in culture. The experiments were performedin triplicates and repeated at least three times.Cell Cycle Analyses by Flow CytometryThe cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometeranalysis [29]. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB orDMSO in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were collected aftertrypsinization with trypsin-EDTA solution (Atlanta Biologicals)and washed with 16 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Approxi-mately 16106 cells were suspended in 300 ml of ice-cold 16PBS,fixed by adding 700 ml of chilled absolute ethanol (to make finalethanol concentration 70%) drop wise and incubated for overnightat 220uC. Cells were pelleted at 10006 rpm for 5 min at 4uC,washed with 16 PBS for 3 times and stained with propidiumiodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by adding 1 ml ofpropidium iodide staining solution (containing 20 mg/ml propi-dium iodide and 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A in 0.1% TritonX-100/PBS) for 1 h on ice in dark. Samples were subjected tofluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses utilizing BeckmanCoulter flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Aminimum of 10,000 events were analyzed in each experiment.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyFor immunofluorescence staining, cells grown in Lab-TekIIchamber slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were treated withSsnB compound in complete culture medium. After treatments,cells were washed with 16PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBSfor 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 16PBSfor 3 times and blocked with 5% immunoglobulin (IgG) free-bovine serum albumin (BSA; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-tories, West Grove, PA) in 16 PBS for overnight at 4uC. Cellswere incubated with antibody raised against active form ofcaspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) diluted in2.5% BSA/PBS for overnight at 4uC. Primary antibodies weredetected with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for2 h at room temperature. After washing with 16 PBS, cells weremounted with antifade Vectashield mounting media (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA), and signals were visualized underNikon-E600 fluorescence microscope. Nuclei were counterstainedwith 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).Total Cell Protein Isolation and Western Blot AnalysesAfter treatment with SsnB, cells were collected, washed with 16PBS, and lysed with 16 cell lysis buffer (Cell SignalingTechnology, Danvers, MA) containing phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin and leupeptin)for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 120006 rpm for 10 min at4uC. Supernatant (total cell protein) was collected and stored at 280uC. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acidmethod using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce/ThermoScientific,Waltham, MA). Equal amount of proteins were diluted with 5 xLaemmli samples loading buffer and boiled for five minutes. Theproteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blots[30]. Briefly, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onpolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 volt for 3 h incold room. Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/TBST (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl with 0.1% Tween-20) for 4 h at room temperature followed by incubation in primaryantibodies diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for overnightat 4uC. After washing with TBST, membrane was incubated withsecondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goatanti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,Dallas, TX) diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for 3 h atroom temperature. Signals were detected by chemiluminiscencedetection kit (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).Primary antibodies used were cleaved caspase-3 and b-actin (CellSignaling Technology), N-myc and p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy).Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species GenerationThe production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells was detected by a cell-permeablefluorescence probe H2DCFDA (carboxy-29,79-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [31]. Briefly, neuroblastoma cells werecultured in DMEM with 10% FBS in Lab-TekII chamber slidesSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) and treated with SsnB for 2 days(SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cell) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). After treatments, cells were washed withHank\u2019s buffered salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Scientific, Waltham,MA) and incubated with 25 mM of carboxy-H2DCFDA dye for30 min at 37uC in dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.Cells were washed three times with HBSS, mounted withVectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and imme-diately examined under Nikon-E600 fluorescence microscopyequipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter [32].Oxidation of H2DCFDA probe occurs almost exclusively in thecytosol, and generates a fluorescence that is proportional to ROSgeneration in that cell. As a negative control, cells withoutH2DCFDA dye were used to detect autofluorescence. Thefluorometric analysis to detect generation of ROS was performedas described previously [33]. Briefly, after treatments with SsnB asmentioned above, cells were labelled with carboxy-H2DCFDA dye(25 mM) for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were trypsinized, washed, andre-suspended in PBS and fluorescence intensity was monitored atexcitation wavelength 485 nm and emission wavelength 530 nmwith a spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sun-nyvale, CA).Colony Formation AssayA two layer soft agarose assay system was used in these studieswith some modifications [34]. Approximately 16104 cells weresuspended in 0.35% agarose in DMEM with 10% FBS, and weregently laid on the bottom agarose layer containing 0.8% agarosewith DMEM+10% FBS in 35 mm2 cell culture dishes. Oncesolidified, the dishes were incubated at 37uC in a humidifiedchamber with 5% CO2. Next day, 500 ml of complete cell culturemedium with respective concentrations of SsnB was added, andcells were allowed to grow for 45 days in an incubator chamber.Fresh medium with respective concentrations of SsnB was addedto the dishes in every 5 days. Cells treated with equal volume ofDMSO were used as control. At the end of experiments, cells werestained with 0.1% crystal violet and cell colonies (more than 15cells per colony) were counted under the light microscope.Hanging-drop Assay for Spheroid Formation3-D in vitro hanging drop assay was carried out to detect theSsnB effect in neuroblastoma spheroid formation [35]. Neuro-blastoma cells were prepared as single cell suspension in completeculture medium (DMEM+10% FBS) without or with SsnB (1 and10 mM). Twenty microliter drop of each prepared cell suspensioncontaining 20,000 cells/drop were pipetted into the inner side ofthe lid of a 60 mm diameter tissue culture dish. The lid was gentlyinverted and placed on top of the culture dish filled with 5 ml ofsterile 16PBS to humidify the culture chamber. The drops wereincubated under tissue culture conditions (at 37uC and 5% CO2)allowing the cells to form aggregate at the base of the droplet. Thecells in each droplet were photographed using Olympus SZX2stereo microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA).Measurement of Glutathione (GSH) LevelCells treated with SsnB or DMSO were washed and re-suspended in PBS and the intracellular GSH level was measuredby luminescence based GSH-Glo glutathione assay kit (Promega,Madison, WI) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The lumines-cence was monitored in a luminometer (Promega Biosystems,Sunnyvale, CA).Data AnalysisData are presented as the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) ofat least three independent experiments. Comparisons were madeamong the groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer ad hoc test (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). A p-value,0.05 was considered significant.ResultsSsnB Inhibits the Survival of Neuroblastoma CellsTo test the inhibitory effects of SsnB on neuroblastoma cellsurvival, we treated human neuroblastoma cell lines of differentgenetic background (SH-SY5Y, SKNF-1, NGP, IMR-32 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) with 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM or 20 mM concentrationof SsnB under in vitro conditions. Following SsnB treatments,neuroblastoma cell were grown for subsequent days and werephotographed under light microscope to evaluate the cellmorphology. The phase contrast images as shown in Figure 1Ademonstrated that SsnB alters the cellular appearance andpromotes cell death (as evaluated by cell morphology; round andclumping of cells is indication of cell death) in all theseneuroblastoma cell lines. SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrationschanged the morphology (as evaluated by rounded cells andindication of cell death) of SH-SY5Y cells and IMR-32 cells (after2 days treatment), NGP (after 3 days treatment), SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells (after 4 days treatment) compared to control DMSO-treated cells. However, such morphological changes were notsignificant at 1 or 5 mM conc. of SsnB in any cell line tested.We further carried out MTT assay to examine the effects ofSsnB on viability of all the above listed neuroblastoma cells. After2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days(SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) treatment with SsnB (1, 5, 10 and20 mM), MTT cell viability assays were performed. The bardiagram in Figure 1B showed that SsnB inhibited, effectively anddose-dependently, the viability of all neuroblastoma cell linestested. Compared to DMSO, SsnB at and above 10 mMconcentration significantly reduced the viability of these cell lines(*p,0.05 vs DMSO) and the IC20 and IC50 were found to be in therange of 6\u20138 mM and 10\u201312 mM, respectively. We did not observesignificant difference in cell survival at SsnB at 1 mM or 5 mMconcentrations compared to control DMSO-treated neuroblasto-ma cells (p.0.05 vs DMSO). No cytotoxic response of SsnB atthese concentrations (and up to ,100 mM) was observed invarious normal human cells e.g. human monocytic THP-1 cells,phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophag-es, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aorticsmooth muscle cells as reported in reference [1]. These datademonstrate the anti-proliferative activity of SsnB on humanneuroblastoma cells, and suggest that SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cellswere most sensitive, NGP cell was moderately sensitive, SKNF-1and SK-N-BE(2) cell lines were least sensitive towards SsnBtreatment. Since 50% cell viability was observed in range of 10\u201312 mM SsnB conc., we used 10 mM as higher conc. and 1 mMlower conc. in our further experiments.SsnB Regulates Cell Cycle Progression in NeuroblastomaCellsTo test whether SsnB-induced cell growth inhibition occursthrough cell cycle arrest, we analyzed cell cycle distribution byflow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide.Representative histogram in Figure 1C showed that 2 days (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32) or 3 days (NGP cells) exposure of SsnB (10 mM)resulted in increase of G2-M phase cells when compared withDMSO-treated controls (G2/M for SH-SY5Y, SsnBSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e9634310 mM = 23.98% vs control = 14.33%; for IMR-32, SsnB10 mM = 23.45% vs control = 19.25%; and for NGP, SsnB10 mM = 26.98% vs control = 17.87%). Similarly, SsnB treatmentfor 4 days increases the number of SK-N-BE(2) cells and SKNF-1cells in G2/M phase, compared to control (G2/M for SKNF-1,SsnB 10 mM = 14.53% vs control = 20.91%; for SK-N-BE(2) cells,SsnB 10 mM = 27.15% vs control = 22.26%). The SsnB (10 mM)induced increase in G2/M fraction was accompanied by adecrease in G0/G1 phase cells. SsnB at 1 mM concentration didnot affect cell cycle progression compared to DMSO-treatedcontrols. These results indicated that the exhibited anti-prolifer-ative effect of SsnB (10 mM) may be exerted by cell cycle arrest atG2-M transition in these neuroblastoma cell lines.SsnB Generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) inNeuroblastoma CellsIsocoumarin and coumarin derivative compounds are wellknown to exhibit their anti-tumor effects by reactive oxygenspecies-induced cell death [36,37]. To test whether SsnB-inducedcell death is resulted from increased level of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), we performed H2DCFDA staining [31,32].H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable non-fluorescent indicator forROS that is oxidized in presence of reactive oxygen species tofluorescent molecule carboxy-DCF. Neuroblastoma cells treatedwith SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells)or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were labelled withH2DCFDA dye for 30 min and cells were immediately examinedunder fluorescence microscopy. The carboxy-DCF positive cellswere quantitated by ImageJ software and plotted. The represen-tative fluorescence images of SH-SY5Y cells in Figure 2Aindicated that the number of carboxy-DCF positive cells (green)was significantly increased at 10 mM concentration of SsnBcompared to DMSO-treated samples (*p,0.05 vs DMSO;Figure 2B). The ROS generation was observed exclusively inthose SsnB treated cells which contain fragmented nuclei (blue).Similar to SH-SY5Y cells, SsnB (10 mM) significantly increasedFigure 1. SsnB inhibits cell growth and viability of neuroblastoma cells. (A) Phase contrast images showing the morphology ofneuroblastoma cells after treatments with SsnB. Neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, NGP, SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were grown in presence ofDMSO or SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) in complete culture medium and were photographed on indicated times. (B) Bar diagrams showing the cellviability after SsnB treatment as evaluated by MTT assays. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y andIMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) and cell viability was measured by MTT assay at 575 nm. Data are represented in foldchange and *p,0.05 vs control. (C) SsnB arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase.

In negativecontrol, no such green staining was observed in cells processedwithout H2DCFDA dye ruling out the autofluorescence (data notshown). These results suggest that SsnB compound promotesintracellular ROS production in neuroblastoma cell lines. Wefurther evaluated SsnB-induced generation of ROS by fluorom-etry assay. Neuroblastoma cells as treated above were incubatedwith H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and the fluorescence intensity wasmeasured at 485 nm (excitation wavelength) and 530 nm (emis-sion wavelength). The H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity (asmeasure of generation of ROS) was significantly increased in cellstreated with SsnB (10 mM) compared to DMSO control (*p,0.05,SsnB 10 mM vs DMSO; Figure 2C) whereas the H2DCFDAfluorescence intensity levels were almost similar in SsnB (1 mM)and DMSO-treated cells (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vsDMSO; Figure 2C).In a reaction system, after the removal of acetate group bycellular esterases and oxidation by reactive oxygen species, thenon-fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA dye is oxidized to fluores-cent molecule carboxy-DCF. To measure the ROS-generatingactivity of SsnB, we also monitored the oxidation of carboxy-H2DCFDA dye in a cell-free system containing carboxy-H2DCFDA dye, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and SsnB at540 nm [38]. HRP was used to supply esterase since withoutesterase carboxy-H2DCFDA is not sensitive to oxidant. As shownin Figure 2D, the optical density (OD) value of reactioncontaining SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) remainedconstant throughout the experiment suggesting that SsnB(10 mM) alone was not able to oxidize H2DCFDA to thefluorescent compound carboxy-DCF. After addition of HRP(5 units/ml) in the reaction mixture containing SsnB (10 mM) +H2DCFDA dye (25 mM), the OD value increased by 2% in thefirst 240 sec and further increased by 8% after 15 min comparedto H2DCFDA + HRP reaction, indicating the increasedoxidation of H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound. Theseresults suggest that SsnB in presence of cellular peroxidasesoxidizes non-fluorescent H2DCFDA dye into the fluorescentcompound. Addition of GSH (0.25 mM or 2.5 mM) in a reactioncontaining SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) + HRP(5 units/ml) lowers the OD value in a dose dependent mannerindicating that GSH as an antioxidant removes the free radicalsgenerated by SsnB in reaction mixture which in turn inhibits theoxidation H2DCFDA dye (Figure 2E).At cellular level, reduced glutathione (GSH) protects cells fromoxidative damage resulted from increased superoxides, peroxidesand free radicals [39]. Since SsnB induces oxidative stress, weasked whether SsnB affects intracellular levels of GSH inneuroblastoma cells. After treatments with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 andSK-N-BE(2) cells), the cellular GSH level was measured byluminescence based glutathione assay kit. Compared to control,the GSH level was significantly decreased (,40% of control) incells treated with 10 mM SsnB (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control;Figure 2F). However, the level of GSH at 1 mM SsnB concentra-tion was slightly higher or equals to control levels (#p#0.05 vscontrol) suggest that at initial stage basal antioxidant mechanismtrying to protect the cell against the toxic effects of SsnB. Theseresults indicated that the GSH depletion was unable to protectneuroblastoma cells against SsnB (10 mM)-induced increasedoxidative stress.SsnB Promotes DNA Fragmentation in NeuroblastomaCellsIncreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known toinduce oxidative stress which in turn cleaves DNA that leads to celldeath. We next examined SsnB-induced DNA fragmentation inneuroblastoma cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasedUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described previously[32]. In this assay, nicked DNA is identified by the addition offluorophore-labelled dUTPs by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) to the terminal ends of damaged DNA inapoptotic cells. The TUNEL-positive cells (green) were quantitat-ed by ImageJ programme and plotted. The number of TUNEL-positive cells at 10 mM concentration of SsnB were significantlyhigher in all neuroblastoma cells compared to control (*p,0.005 vscontrol; Figure 3A). The TUNEL-positive cells in SsnB (1 mM)were almost similar to DMSO-treated samples (ns = nonsignif-icant vs control, p.0.05). The representative fluorescence imagesfrom SH-SY5Y cells as shown in Figure 3B indicated that SsnB at10 mM concentration induced DNA fragmentation (green), andthe staining for fragmented DNA (TUNEL-positive staining, greenin color) and nuclei (blue) were overlapped in a single cell (asshown in enlarged image) suggest that SsnB promotes apoptosis inthese cells. However, such TUNEL-positive cells were not detectedin DMSO- or SsnB (1 mM)-treated cells.SsnB Activates Caspase-3 in Neuroblastoma CellsAt cellular level, mitochondria- or receptor (Fas/FasL)-mediat-ed pathways activate caspase signaling cascade which in turninduces DNA damage and initiates programmed cell death(apoptosis) [40]. To determine whether SsnB-induced cell deathis mediated by caspase activation, we performed Western blottingas well as immunofluorescence assay to detect active form ofcaspase-3 in neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1and SK-N-BE(2) cells). The number of cleaved caspase-3 positivecells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted.The bar diagram in Figure 3C demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mMsignificantly increased the cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green)compared to DMSO or SsnB (1 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells(*p,0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control). The representative immuno-fluorescence images for SH-SY5Y in Figure 3D indicated that thecolor intensity of cleaved caspase-3 (green) was significantlyincreased in SsnB-treated (10 mM) cells and the cleaved caspase-3 fluorescence signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm anddid not overlap with nucleus (blue). The corresponding Westernblots in Figure 3E demonstrated that the cleaved and active formof caspase-3 protein bands (17 and 19 kDa) were present inprotein samples prepared from 10 mM SsnB treated cells (*p,0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control, Figure 3E and F), while proteinssamples from DMSO and SsnB (1 mM) had almost undetectablelevels of cleaved caspase-3 (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vscontrol; Figure 3E and F). We further examined the activation ofcaspase-3 by SsnB (10 mM) at different time points (6, 12, 24 and48 h) in SH-SY5Y cells. The presence of an active form ofcaspase-3 protein band (,19 kDa) showed that SsnB inducescleavage of caspase-3 in these cells even as early as 6 h SsnBexposure (Figure 3G, upper panel). Thus, these data suggest thatSsnB induces apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 in allneuroblastoma cell lines tested. We also observed increasedexpression of p53 in SsnB (10 mM) treated cells compare toDMSO-treated cells (middle panel; Figure 3G). Activation of p53,a tumor suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2phase of cell cycle, hence, increased expression of p53 by SsnBSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer ActivityPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343suggested that p53 might also involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicityin p53-containing neuroblastoma cells.SsnB Reduces Expression of N-myc in NeuroblastomaCellsN-myc proto-oncogene act as a transcription factor, andamplification and overexpression of N-myc gene promotestumorigenicity in neuroblastoma cells [41]. We evaluated levelof N-myc proteins from 2 days (IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4days (SK-N-BE(2) cells) SsnB-treated N-myc amplified neuroblas-toma cells by Western blotting, and protein signal intensity wasmeasured by ImageJ programme and plotted. Western blot inFigure 4A demonstrates that SsnB at 10 mM inhibited theexpression of N-myc protein in these cell lines (*p,0.005, SsnB10 mM vs control; Figure 4A and B). However such reduction inprotein expression was not observed at 1 mM concentration ofSsnB (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs control; Figure 4A andB).N-acetylcystamine (NAC) Attenuates the InhibitoryEffects of SsnB in Neuroblastoma CellsThe reduced cell viability, increased ROS and decreased GSHlevels by SsnB indicated that depletion of glutathione may be aprimary cause for the cell death. Next, we examined whetheraddition of N-acetylcystamine (NAC), a GSH precursor and anantioxidant, can protect neuroblastoma cells from SsnB-inducedFigure 2. SsnB induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ROS levels were evaluated by H2DCFDA staining after SsnB treatments(1 mM or 10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). Signals were examined under fluorescencemicroscope (A); carboxy-DCF positive cells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted (B). (A) Representative fluorescence imagesfrom SH-SY5Y cells showing that compared to DMSO and SsnB (1 mM), SsnB at 10 mM concentration induced ROS generation (green, H2DCFDA-positive cells) and signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm (as shown in enlarged images).

(F) Neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2, 3 or 4 days asmentioned above were used to measure cellular glutathione (GSH) levels using luminescence based glutathione assay kit.

To test this hypothesis, neuroblastoma cells werepretreated with NAC (0.5, 1 and 5 mM) for 1 h followed bytreatment with SsnB (10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2)cells), and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. MTT cellviability assays showed that NAC treatment suppresses SsnB-induced cell death in a concentration dependent manner(Figure 5A). SsnB (10 mM) induced neuroblastoma cell death inrange of 40\u201360% (*p,0.05 vs control) whereas presence of NAC(1 mM or 5 mM) significantly increased the viability of SsnB-treated cells (#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC1 or 5 mM). Next we measured the levels of ROS in SsnB-treatedcells preincubated with NAC by fluorometry assay usingH2DCFDA dye. NAC at 1 and 5 mM concentration significantlyreduces ROS levels in SsnB (10 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells(#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC 1 or 5 mM;Figure 5B). These data suggest that NAC as an ROS scavengerremoves SsnB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species incells.We further examined cleaved caspase-3 level in SH-SY5Y cells(2 days treatment) and SK-N-BE(2) cells (4 days treatment)incubated with SsnB (10 mM) with or without NAC (0.5, 1 or5 mM) by Western blotting. Representative blot in Figure 5C andcorresponding bar diagram (Figure 5D) demonstrated thatFigure 3. SsnB induces apoptotic cell death. SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 for 2 days, NGP for 3 days, andSKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells for 4 days) were used to monitor DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay (A and B), and cleaved caspsase-3 by immunofluorescence (C and D), and Western blotting (E and F). DAPI (blue) was used to stain nuclei.

Agarose gel colonyformation assay is an anchorage-independent in vitro cell transfor-mation assay, and mimics the process of in vivo carcinogenesis [34].Neuroblastoma cells (N-myc amplified cell, SK-N-BE(2), and N-myc nonamplified cell, SH-SY5Y) were grown in agarose inpresence or absence of SsnB (1 mM and 10 mM) and after 45 daysnumber of colonies were counted. The representative phasecontrast images in Figure 6A showed that the size of colonies inSsnB 10 mM treated samples were significantly smaller than thecontrol and SsnB (1 mM) treated samples. The representative bardiagram demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mM concentrationsignificantly inhibited the colony formation capability of bothcells (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control; Figure 6B).Since SsnB inhibits the formation of neuroblastoma colony inanchorage-independent agarose gel assay, we further tested if theinhibitory effects of SsnB inhibit the initiation of neuroblastomatumors in hanging drop assay method. In hanging drop assay thecells under the force of gravity and surface tension startaccumulating at the bottom of the hanging drop and join togetherto form a spheroid. Spheroids represent an in vitro 3D tissuestructure that mimics in vivo tumor tissue organization andmicroenvironment, and 3D culture better reflect cancer cells intheir native, in vivo, environment [35]. As shown in Figure 6C andD, within 24 hour, both neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells, C;and SK-N-BE(2) cells, D) grown in hanging drop culture startaggregating at the bottom of the droplet. On day 12, the shape ofthe aggregates became rounder and smoother with a gradualdecrease in the radius of the spheroid, and form compact cellclusters in DMSO- and SsnB (1 mM)-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells. The decrease in size is the result of higher cell\u2013cellcohesion, which yields more compact aggregates. However, at10 mM SsnB concentration the cells are loosely attached inspheroids suggesting that SsnB at 10 mM inhibits cell-cellattachment in both cell lines (SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells)as a result these cells are unable to aggregate to form compactspheroids.DiscussionNeuroblastoma has heterogeneous population of cells ofdifferent genetic background [15]. Increasing evidence supportsthat molecular and genetic factors such as N-myc oncogeneamplification, deletion of short arm of chromosome 1 and highexpression of neurotrophin receptors (TrkA and TrkB) areassociated with malignant transformation and progression ofneuroblastoma. Despite targeting new molecular targets, and theuse of multimodal therapy which includes surgery, radiotherapy inconjunction with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody basedimmunotherapy, approximately 40% of children with high-riskneuroblastoma remain incurable [23,43,44]. Hence, the identifi-cation and development of new therapeutic compounds with lesstoxicity are urgently needed.We used a novel naturally-occurring compound, Sparstolonin B(SsnB), isolated from the tubers of an aquatic Chinese herb,Sparganium stoloniferum [1]. The crude extract prepared from thisherb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4\u20136]. In thepresent study SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrations signifi-cantly inhibits the growth and viability of human neuroblastomacells of different genetic background such as N-myc amplified withwild p53 cells (IMR-32 and NGP cells), N-myc amplified withmutated p53 cells (SKN-BE(2) cell), and N-myc nonamplified cell(SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells). However, the sensitivity of thesecells towards SsnB is different, SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells aresensitive, NGP cells are moderate sensitive, and SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells are least sensitive (as shown by cell morphology andMTT cell viability assays in Figure 1A and B). The reducedviability by SsnB losses neuroblastoma cells ability to formcompact spheroids that decreases the tumorigenic potential ofboth N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2) cells) and N-myc nonamplifiedneuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) tested as seen in hangingdrop method and anchorage-independent colony formation assay(Figure 6). These in vitro 3-D culture results further confirmed theanti-tumorigenic activity of SsnB against human neuroblastoma.The SsnB exerts its inhibitory effects only in neuroblastoma celllines, and up to ,100 mM concentration SsnB did not exhibitscytotoxicity towards various normal non-tumor human cells suchas human monocytic THP-1 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, human umbilical veinendothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells [1].The inhibitory effects of SsnB on cell growth and viability areresulted from the caspase-mediated cell death (Figure 3C\u2013F). TheFigure 4. N-myc protein level in IMR-32, NGP and SK-N-BE(2)cells. (A) Representative Western blots for N-myc protein in total cellextract prepared from IMR-32, NGP and SK-N-BE(2) cells treated with orwithout SsnB (1 mM or 10 mM) for 2 days, 3 days or 4 days, respectively.b-actin was used to check loading differences.

The presence of apoptotic nuclei in SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells compared to control DMSO-treatedcells (as revealed by TUNEL assay, Figure 3A and B) indicates thatactivation of caspase cascade by SsnB trigger apoptotic cell deathpathways. In addition, we also found that SsnB promotes ROSgeneration in both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplifiedneuroblastoma cells (Figure 2A\u2013C). The ROS generating capacityof SsnB was confirmed by our cell-free system in which SsnB inpresence of peroxidase (HRP) oxidized H2DCDA to fluorescentcompound (Figure 2D and E). Reactive oxygen species such as freeradicals and peroxides increases cellular oxidative stress whichpromotes lipids peroxidation and oxidation of nucleic acid andamplifies the cell death. The imbalance between the generation ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense statusdisrupt the redox homeostasis [39]. In our present study, weobserved that SsnB significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) levelin neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2F). GSH acts as an antioxidantand its role to remove oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygenspecies is well known hence GSH depletion in presence of SsnBfail to remove free radicals and this might be the primary cause ofSsnB-induced cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. Thecritical role of GSH in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity was furthersupported by our observations obtained with N-acetylcystamine(NAC). NAC is a GSH precursor and functions as an antioxidant.Co-incubation of NAC removes free radicals from the SsnB-treated cells and inhibits the activation of cleaved caspase-3(Figure 5B\u2013D). These events thus protect the cells against theoxidative insults caused by SsnB and increased the cell viability(Figure 5A). Hence these data suggest that SsnB-induced cytotoxicFigure 5. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuates the inhibitory effects of SsnB. (A) Neuroblastoma cells were pretreated with NAC (0.5, 1 or5 mM) for 1 h followed by SsnB (10 mM) treatment for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) and aftertreatments MTT cell viability assays was carried out.

The cell cycle arrest atG2/M transition is a potential target for cancer therapy as itprevents DNA-damaged cells from entering mitosis, and cell cycleblockage at this checkpoint is carried out by cell cycle-relatedproteins such as p53 and cyclins. Activation of p53, a tumorsuppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2 phase of cellcycle [46]. The results in present study demonstrate that treatingneuroblastoma cells with SsnB (10 mM) resulted in cell cycle blockin G2/M phase (flow cytometry analysis, Figure 1C) and increasein expression of p53 compared to DMSO treated cells (Figure 3G).These findings suggested that p53-mediated apoptosis might alsoinvolve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity in p53-containing neuroblas-toma cells.It is well known that N-myc amplification is associated withneuroblastoma tumor progression and drug resistance [41,47]. N-myc, a member of the myc family of proto-oncoprotein, acts as atranscription factor and regulates the expression of genes involvedin cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis, and overexpression ofN-myc in trasnsgenic mice results in neuroblastoma development[48]. However, downregulation of N-myc expression has beenshown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in neuroblastomacells [49,50]. In the current study, we found that SsnB at 10 mMconcentration suppresses the N-myc expression in IMR-32, NGPand SK-N-BE(2) cells (Figure 4) which might be correlated withthe SsnB-mediated anticancer activity on human neuroblastomacells.In summary, the present study for the first time demonstratedthe anticancer property of SsnB on human neuroblastoma cells.SsnB induces apoptosis in a wide range of neuroblastoma cell lines.The reduced tumorigenic ability of both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplified cells resulted from SsnB in our colonyformation and hanging drop assays, and a recent published studyshowing that SsnB exerts anti-angiogenic property by downreg-ulating mRNA level of cell cycle regulatory proteins [3] indicatedthat SsnB can be a used as a novel therapeutics anticancer agent.Drugs that generate ROS and induce apoptosis are used alone orin combination with other therapies to treat cancer, suggestingthat SsnB can be a promising antitumor agent for neuroblastomaand requires preclinical studies on animal models [51].Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: AK USS.
