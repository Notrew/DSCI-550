"Evaluation of Salmonella enterica Type III Secretion System EffectorProteins as Carriers for Heterologous Vaccine AntigensWael Abdel Halim Hegazy,a,c* Xin Xu,b Leonid Metelitsa,b and Michael HenselcMikrobiologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germanya; Texas Children\u2019s Cancer Center, Center for Cell & Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine,Houston, Texas, USAb; and Abteilung Mikrobiologie, Universit\u00e4t Osnabr\u00fcck, Osnabr\u00fcck, GermanycLive attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica have a high potential as carriers of recombinant vaccines. The type III secretionsystem (T3SS)-dependent translocation of S. enterica can be deployed for delivery of heterologous antigens to antigen-presenting cells. Here we investigated the efficacy of various effector proteins of the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI2)-encoded T3SS for the translocation of model antigens and elicitation of immune responses. The SPI2 T3SS effector proteins SifA,SteC, SseL, SseJ, and SseF share an endosomal membrane-associated subcellular localization after translocation. We observedthat all effector proteins could be used to translocate fusion proteins with the model antigens ovalbumin and listeriolysin intothe cytosol of host cells. Under in vitro conditions, fusion proteins with SseJ and SteC stimulated T-cell responses that were su-perior to those triggered by fusion proteins with SseF. However, in mice vaccinated with Salmonella carrier strains, only fusionproteins based on SseJ or SifA elicited potent T-cell responses. These data demonstrate that the selection of an optimal SPI2 ef-fector protein for T3SS-mediated translocation is a critical parameter for the rational design of effective Salmonella-basedrecombinant vaccines.The use of live attenuated bacterial pathogens is a promisingapproach for the rational design of new recombinant vaccines.Several attenuated carrier strains have been deployed for expres-sion and delivery of various viral, bacterial, or parasitic antigensfor vaccination (16). Live attenuated strains of Salmonella thatsynthesize and secrete foreign antigens were developed as vaccinesfor a number of infectious diseases and cancer treatment (19).Moreover, the use of live attenuated Salmonella to deliver recom-binant antigens to the immune system is an attractive strategy forthe construction of multivalent vaccines (17). Salmonella-basedvaccines provide a number of advantages over other antigen de-livery strategies, including low cost of production, oral delivery,the absence of animal products, genetic stability, and safety (3). Inaddition, Salmonella vaccines delivering heterologous antigenselicit efficient immune responses via stimulation of both innateand adaptive immunity (3). The availability of S. enterica serovarTyphimurium for preclinical work in mouse models and favor-able clinical experience with the live attenuated vaccines S. entericaserovar Typhi Ty21a, CVD908, and CVD909 (20) further facilitatethe development of Salmonella-based vaccination approaches.Salmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen thatinhabits a unique membrane-bound host cell compartment,termed the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) (reviewed inreference 12). Localization within the SCV prevents delivery of invivo-expressed foreign proteins to the major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) class I-restricted antigen presentation pathwayand hinders the use of Salmonella as a vaccine carrier to inducespecific CD8 T cells, which are crucial for protection against vi-ruses, intracellular bacteria, and tumors.The majority of Gram-negative pathogens deploy complex vir-ulence factors termed type III secretion systems (T3SS). T3SS me-diate distinct functions that include antiphagocytic and cytotoxiceffects on host cells (Ysc/Yop system of Yersinia spp.), invasion ofhost cells (S. enterica SPI1 system, Shigella Mxi/Spa system), andintracellular pathogenesis (S. enterica SPI2 system, ChlamydiaT3SS) (6). T3SS consist of at least 20 different subunits whichenable these bacteria to translocate specific effectors directly intothe host cell cytoplasm in order to exert a broad range of virulencefunctions. The T3SS assembles needle-like appendages, whichshare similarity with the flagellar basal body and some of its pro-teins, including those which form the core of the central channeland are highly conserved between the two systems (2). The T3SSapparatus, also referred to as the injectisome, spans the inner andouter membranes of the bacterial envelope and secretestranslocon and effector proteins. Translocon proteins alloweffector proteins access to the eukaryotic cells by forming poresin the host cell membrane and forming a connecting channel-like complex between the bacterium and the eukaryotic mem-brane. After translocation into eukaryotic host cells, effectorproteins subvert various host cell functions and immunity,thereby promoting bacterial virulence (4).Several important virulence factors of S. enterica are encodedby genes within Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI), and twoimportant loci are termed SPI1 and SPI2 (9). SPI1 and SPI2 genesencode distinct T3SS that translocate bacterial effectors duringdifferent phases of pathogenesis (5). Salmonella translocates T3SSeffector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm mediated by eitherthe SPI1 T3SS from the extracellular stage and from within theReceived 13 October 2011 Returned for modification 6 November 2011Accepted 3 January 2012Published ahead of print 17 January 2012Editor: A.

This approach wasmainly used to direct the expression of the desired antigen to aparticular location in the bacterial cell and increase the immuno-genicity of foreign antigens by fusing them to proteins that couldexert a carrier effect (15). Salmonella T3SS-mediated transloca-tion was used for efficient delivery of heterologous antigens intothe cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to promi-nent CD8 T cell responses (19, 23). Salmonella T3SS-mediatedtranslocation can be used for efficient delivery of heterologousantigen fusions to SPI2 effector proteins to the cytosol of APC,leading to prominent CD8 T cell priming in orally immunizedmice (21). SPI2 effector proteins, especially those which are syn-thesized only when the Salmonella is inside host cells such as den-dritic cells (DCs) or macrophages (1), have been thought to bepromising candidates for carriers of antigens to the MHC class Ipathway.Our previous studies used the SPI2 T3SS effector protein SseFas a fusion partner for the translocation of heterologous antigens(11, 23). In addition to SseF, 20 or more effector proteins aretranslocated by the SPI2 T3SS. We hypothesized that the translo-cation efficacy of effector-antigen fusions might be directly corre-lated to the immune response triggered by the vaccine. In thisstudy, we used genes for five membrane-associated SPI2 effectorsunder the control of the PsseA promoter for the generation of ex-pression cassettes with model antigens. We examined the efficacyof antigen translocation into the cytosol of APCs and in vivo im-munogenicity of fusion constructs with effector SseJ, SifA, SseL, orSteC in comparison with that of the previously described SseFeffector. We observed that the highest immune response in vitroand in vivo was induced by constructs based on the effector SseJ.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and growth conditions. Salmonella enterica serovar Ty-phimurium NCTC 12023 was used as the wild-type strain. The purD htrAdouble-deficient strain MvP728 (23) was used as the attenuated carrierstrain. For the generation of recombinant plasmids, E. coli DH5\ufffd was usedas the host. Plasmids were introduced into Salmonella strains by electro-poration, and recombinant strains were cultured in medium containing50 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 carbenicillin in order to maintain the plasmids.Generation of plasmids. For generation of expression cassettes withgene fusions consisting of sseJ, sifA, or sseL plus ovalbumin (OVA) and thehemagglutinin (HA) tag under the control of the SPI2 promoter PsseA, agene fragment comprising codons 196 to 386 of chicken OVA with theCD4 and CD8 epitopes was amplified by PCR using OVA-For-NaeI,OVA-HA-Rev-XbaI, and pOMP as a template, which was later digestedwith NaeI and XbaI. PsseJ::sseJ::hSurvivin (p3550), PsifA::sifA::hSurvivin(p3551), or PsseL::sseL::hSurvivin (p3552) was digested with EcoRV andXbaI. Digested OVA was ligated to the large fragment of the digestedplasmids to obtain plasmids PsseJ::sseJ::OVA::HA (p3554), PsifA::sifA::OVA::HA, (p3556), and PsseL::sseL::OVA::HA (p3555), and these plasmidswere used to amplify sseJ::OVA::HA, sifA::OVA::HA, or sseL::OVA::HAusing the forward primers SseJ-For-EcoRI, SifA-For-Effector-EcoRI, andSseL-Effector-For-EcoRI and the reverse primer OVA-HA-Rev-XbaI.PCR products were digested later by EcoRI and XbaI. Plasmid p3342harboring PsseA::sscB sseF::hSurvivin::HA (23) was digested with EcoRIand XbaI, and the large fragment was ligated to digested sseJ::OVA::HA,sifA::OVA::HA, or sseL::OVA::HA fragments, resulting in PsseA::sseJ::O-VA::HA (p3631), PsseA::sifA::OVA::HA (p3632), or PsseA::sseL::OVA::HA(p3633). The plasmids obtained were confirmed by colony PCR, diagnos-tic digestion, and sequencing using T7-Seq and T3-Seq primers. The plas-mids used in this study are listed in Table 1 and the sequences of oligonu-cleotides are indicated in Table 2.For generation of expression cassettes consisting of the gene fusionSteC::OVA::HA under the control of SPI2 promoter PsseA, the low-copy-number plasmid pWSK29 was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and OVAwas amplified using the primers OVA595-For-EcoRI and OVA-HA-Rev-XbaI and the plasmid pOMP as the template. Amplified OVA digestedwith EcoRI and XbaI was ligated to digested pWSK29, resulting in plasmidpWSK29::OVA::HA. The sseA promoter was amplified using the primersProB-For-KpnI and ProB-Rev-EcoRI and the plasmid p3342 as the tem-plate. Plasmid pWSK29::OVA::HA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI andligated to the amplified SseA promoter, which was digested with KpnI andEcoRI, yielding plasmid pWSK29::PsseA::OVA::HA. The gene for the effec-tor protein SteC was amplified using SteC-Effector-For-EcoRI and SteC-Rev-EcoRI. pWSK29 PsseA::OVA::HA and amplified SteC were both di-gested by EcoRI and ligated, yielding PsseA::steC::OVA::HA (p3634). Theresulting plasmid was confirmed by colony PCR for the right orientationand sequenced using T3-Seq and T7-Seq.For generation of expression cassettes consisting of fusions of sseJ, sifA,sseL, or steC to a fragment of lisA and the HA tag under the control of SPI2promoter PsseA, the fragments PsseA::sseJ, PsseA::sifA, PsseA::sseL, and PsseA::SteC were amplified using ProB-For-KpnI as the forward primer andSseJ-Rev-EcoRV, SifA-Rev-EcoRV, SseL-Rev-EcoRV, or SteC-Rev-NaeIas the reverse primer. PCR products were digested with KpnI and EcoRVor NaeI (Table 2). Plasmid p2810 harboring PsseA::sseF::lisA::HA (25) wasdigested with KpnI and EcoRV, and the large fragment was ligated toamplified digested PsseA::sseJ, PsseA::sifA, PsseA::sseL, or PsseA::steC, yieldingplasmids PsseA::sseJ::lisA::HA (p3635), PsseA::sifA::lisA::HA (p3636), PsseA::sseL::lisA::HA (p3637), and PsseA::steC::lisA::HA (p3638). All the plasmidswere confirmed with colony PCR, diagnostic digestion, and sequencingusing T3-Seq and T7-Seq.Analysis of synthesis and translocation of recombinant vaccine an-tigens. In order to quantify the amounts of recombinant protein pro-duced by the various strains, Western blots were analyzed using the Od-yssey detection system, and signal levels for model antigens werenormalized to the levels of the constitutively synthesized control proteinDnaK.For analyses of translocation, HeLa cells were infected with variousSalmonella strains harboring plasmids for the expression of effector::TABLE 1 Plasmids used in this studyPlasmid Relevant characteristics ReferencepWSK29 Low-copy-no. vector, Ampr Lab stockpOMP-OVA lacZ::OVA Lab stockp2629 pWSK29 PsseA sscB sseF::OVA::M45 11p2810 pWSK29 PsseA sscB sseF::lisA51-363::HA 11p3550 pWSK29 PsseJ sseJ::hSurvivin This studyp3551 pWSK29 PsifA sifA::hSurvivin This studyp3552 pWSK29 PsseL sseL::hSurvivin This studyp3553 pWSK29 PsteC steC::hSurvivin This studyp3554 pWSK29 PsseJ sseJ::OVA::HA This studyp3556 pWSK29 PsifA sifA::OVA::HA This studyp3555 pWSK29 PsseL sseL::OVA::HA This studyp3626 pWSK29 PsteC steC::OVA::HA This studyp3631 pWSK29 PsseA sseJ::OVA::HA This studyp3632 pWSK29 PsseA sifA::OVA::HA This studyp3633 pWSK29 PsseA sseL::OVA::HA This studyp3634 pWSK29 PsseA steC::OVA::HA This studyp3635 pWSK29 PsseA sseJ::lisA51-363::HA This studyp3636 pWSK29 PsseA sifA::lisA51-363::HA This studyp3637 pWSK29 PsseA sseL::lisA51-363::HA This studyp3638 pWSK29 PsseA steC::lisA51-363::HA This studyHegazy et al.1194 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orglisA::HA or effector::OVA::HA under the control of PsseA. As a carrierstrain, the double mutant strain MvP728 was used. At 16 h after infection,the cells were fixed and processed for immunostaining of Salmonella LPS(rabbit anti-Salmonella O1,4,5; Difco, BD) and the HA epitope tag(Roche) The cells were analyzed by microscopy using a Zeiss LSM700confocal laser scanning microscope.Dendritic cell infection. The preparation and culture of bone mar-row cells from C57BL/6 mice for generation of bone marrow-deriveddendritic cells (BM-DC) was described previously (13). After 6 days ofculture in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Colbe, Germany) containing10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY)and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, the BM-DC were suspended insmall flasks for experiments at a density of 8 \ufffd 106 cells per flask andallowed to adhere for at least 12 h.Bacterial strains were grown overnight in LB, and the optical density at600 nm (OD600) of the cultures was adjusted to 0.2 in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Aliquots of this suspension were added to flasks inorder to yield the multiplicities of infection (MOI) indicated in the leg-ends to Fig. 3, 4, and 5. The flasks were centrifuged at 500 \ufffd g for 5 min tosynchronize the infection and subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C in an at-mosphere of 5% CO2 for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed threetimes with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with RPMI 1640 mediumcontaining 100 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 gentamicin for 1 h, followed by RPMI 1640 me-dium containing 25 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 gentamicin for the rest of the experiment.At 16 h after infection, the cells were fixed and processed for immu-nostaining of Salmonella LPS (rabbit anti-Salmonella O1,4,5; Difco, BD),the HA epitope tag (Roche), and the dendritic cell-specific marker CD11c(Armenian hamster anti-CD11c; BD). The cells were analyzed by micros-copy using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope.Quantification of T cell stimulation. The SL-H2-Kb-specific murineCD8\ufffd T cell hybridoma B3Z expresses the lacZ reporter gene under thecontrol of the NFAT enhancer (13). The cell line was kindly provided byNilabh Shastri at the University of California at Berkeley. Briefly, BM-DCfrom C57BL/6 mice at 105 per well in 96-well plates were infected withbacterial strains grown to stationary phase. Infection was performed for 1h at MOI of 25 and 100 for wild-type and MvP728 strains, respectively.The plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 \ufffd g to synchronize the infec-tion. After the infection period, noninternalized bacteria were removedby two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To kill remainingextracellular bacteria, infected cells were incubated for 1 h in mediumcontaining 100 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 of gentamicin. After a washing step, mediumcontaining 25 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 gentamicin was added. B3Z T cells were added tothe plates and cocultured at a DC:T cell ratio ranging from 1:8 to 1:0.125in a total volume of 200 \ufffdl per well for 24 h. Cells were recovered bycentrifugation at maximal speed and lysed by the addition of 100 \ufffdl sub-strate solution (0.15 mM chlorophenyl red \ufffd-galactopyranoside, 0.5%[vol/vol] Nonidet P-40 in PBS). After incubation for 6 to 8 h at 37\u00b0C, theabsorbance was determined at 595 nm.Stimulation of T cell proliferation was analyzed as described before(25). Briefly, BM-DCs from C57BL/6 mice were seeded at 105 per well ina 96-well plate. The cells were infected with bacterial strains at an MOI of25. All experiments were performed in parallel for 1 h. The cells werewashed twice with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium contain-ing 100 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 gentamicin for 1 h. After infection, plates were gamma-irradiated (3,600 rad) prior to coculture with 2 \ufffd 105 spleen cells fromOT-I or OT-II mice (10) at a final ratio of 4:1. These mice express atransgenic T cell receptor (V\ufffd2/V\ufffd5) specific for the OVA-derived pep-tides presented either in the MHC class I or MHC class II context. Thetransgene status was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting(FACS) with anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5), anti-mouse CD8\ufffd (clone5H10), and anti-mouse V\ufffd2 (clone B20.1) from BD Biosciences. As acontrol, spleen cells were stimulated with 1 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 concanavalin A(Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) without the addition of DC. After 48 h ofcoincubation, the proliferation was measured by 3H uptake for an addi-tional 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate and at least threebiological replicates were performed.Vaccination experiments. The immune responses to vaccination withlive Salmonella carriers translocating fusion proteins of listeriolysin (Llo)to various effectors were analyzed as previously described (25). Briefly,BALB/c female mice 6 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratory) were maintainedunder standard conditions at the Baylor College of Medicine animal fa-cility and were treated according to an IACUC-approved protocol. Forimmunization, cohorts of seven mice were immunized by orogastric ap-plication of 1 \ufffd 109 CFU per mouse of Salmonella MvP728 or MvP728harboring plasmid p2810 (sseF::lisA), p3635 (sseJ::lisA), p3636 (sifA::lisA),p3637 (sseL::lisA), or p3638 (steC::lisA). The inocula were applied in 200\ufffdl of 5% sodium bicarbonate using 20-gauge gastric gavage needles (Pop-per & Sons, Inc.). Booster immunizations were applied at days 14 and 28after primary vaccination using the same conditions. The inoculum usedwas always verified by serial dilution and plating on LB agar plates in thepresence of the appropriate antibiotic.MHC pentamer staining and FACS analysis. Blood samples were col-lected 10, 21, and 35 days after immunization from vaccinated mice orcontrol groups. After erythrocyte lysis with ammonium chloride solution,cells were stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled H-2Kd/Llo91\u201399 (GYKDGNEYI)-specific Pro5 pentamer (ProImmune, Inc.), rat anti-mousefluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD8 monoclonal antibody(MAb) KT15 (Proimmune, Inc.), allophycocyanin-conjugated hamsteranti-mouse CD3e (BD Biosciences), and peridinin chlorophyll protein(PerCP)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Biosciences). The fluoro-chrome and isotype-matching MAbs suggested by BD Biosciences wereused as negative controls. The analysis was performed on an LSR-II flowcytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACDiva software, v. 6.0.Statistical analyses. Analyses for unpaired groups and the controlgroup were performed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) witha Bonferroni t test using SigmaPlot 11.RESULTSGeneration and evaluation of expression cassettes.

For either model antigen, the fragments encodeCD4- and CD8-restricted epitopes, and a large panel of tools isavailable for the characterization of immune responses. The ex-pression cassettes were placed on the low-copy-number plasmidpWSK29, which has previously been shown to be compatible withSsrAB-regulated in vivo expression (8, 11). The modular design ofthe various expression cassettes is presented in Fig. 1.Next, strains harboring the expression cassettes were tested forthe levels of recombinant fusion proteins. We first used in vitroculture conditions known to induce the expression of genes of theSsrAB regulon and the synthesis of SPI2 effector proteins. Thesynthesis of SPI2 effector-OVA-HA (Fig. 2A and C) and SPI2effector-Llo-HA (Fig. 2B and D) fusion proteins was observed forall constructs analyzed here. In order to quantify the amounts ofrecombinant protein produced by the various strains, Westernblots were analyzed using the Odyssey detection system, and sig-nals for model antigens were normalized to the levels of the con-stitutively synthesized control protein DnaK. For both model an-tigens, SseJ and SteC fusions were expressed at significantly higherlevels than SseL or SifA fusions. SteC fusions provided the highestlevel of recombinant-protein synthesis.Since all fusion constructs were expressed by episomal genes,we tested plasmid stability in the absence of antibiotic selectionand under conditions that mimic the intracellular environment ofSalmonella in host cells (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).These experiments indicated that 80 to 90% of the bacterial cellsmaintained the plasmids over 7 days of repeated subculture in theabsence of antibiotics. Similar numbers of plasmid-harboringbacteria were obtained by subculture in noninducing minimalmedium without antibiotics, while 60 to 70% plasmid-harboringcells were obtained after subculture in SPI2-inducing minimalmedium without antibiotics. Under these conditions, the greatestloss of plasmids was observed for fusion constructs with SseJ andSseF, while constructs based on SseL were maintained in morethan 80% of the cells. These data suggest that the maintenance ofexpression cassettes is sufficiently stable for potential in vivo ap-plications.Next, we analyzed the translocation of the model antigens byintracellular Salmonella in mammalian cells. We investigated thetranslocation of OVA-HA (Fig. 3) and Llo-HA fusion proteinsusing expression cassettes with the PsseA promoter. All expressioncassettes mediated translocation of fusion proteins into HeLa cells(Fig. 3A) and BM-DC (Fig. 3B). However, the intensities of theHA tag immunofluorescence staining of infected BM-DC variedconsiderably, indicating different amounts of the translocatedprotein (data not shown). In contrast, infected HeLa cells showedmore uniform signal intensities and were used for quantification.Infected HeLa cells harboring similar numbers of intracellularSalmonella were selected, and the signal intensities of the HA tag ofthe examined constructs were compared. The SPI2 effectors wereranked in the following order depending on the level of the fusionprotein expression: SteC \ufffd SseJ \ufffd SseF \ufffd SseL \ufffd SifA (Fig. 3C).Quantification of T cell responses to antigens presented byintracellular Salmonella. We next compared the antigen-dependent stimulation of T cells after uptake of recombinant Sal-monella strains with expression of recombinant antigens underthe control of PsseA. BM-DC were infected with the attenuated S.enterica serovar Typhimurium carrier strain MvP728, which isdeficient in purD and htrA (21) and harbors plasmids for the ex-pression of SPI2 effector::OVA::HA under the control of PsseA.Subsequently, infected BM-DC were incubated with B3Z T cells.B3Z is a T cell hybridoma that recognizes the OVA-derived SIINFEKL epitope in the context of H2Kb and expresses the lacZ re-porter gene under the control of the NFAT enhancer. The\ufffd-galactosidase activity thus is a measure of the antigen-dependent stimulation (25). Very low stimulation was observedwith the vector controls without expression cassettes, while addi-FIG 1 Generation of expression cassettes for heterologous vaccine antigens. Expression cassettes consist of hybrid genes for the expression of fusion proteinscomprising the full-length SPI2 effector protein SseJ, SifA, SseL, or SteC, portions of the model antigen Llo or OVA, and a C-terminal HA epitope tag for thestandardized detection of the amounts of fusion protein. Expression cassettes with fusions to sseF were described previously (11). In all cassettes, the expressionis controlled by the in vivo-activated promoter PsseA of the SsrAB regulon. All plasmids were generated on the basis of the low-copy-number vector pWSK29, andp3631, etc., are plasmid designations.Hegazy et al.1196 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgtion of the SIINFEKL peptide was used as positive control, result-ing in maximal stimulation. The use of the Salmonella purD htrAstrain with plasmids harboring various expression cassettes re-sulted in highly increased stimulation of the T cell hybridoma. Thehighest stimulation was obtained with expression cassettes withSseJ and SteC fusion proteins (Fig. 4). These findings were com-patible with the quantification of signals for protein translocation,which also showed that levels of SteC and SseJ fusion proteinswere highest.As a second approach, we used the OVA-specific T cells iso-lated from OT-I or OT-II transgenic mice (25). OT-I mice aretransgenic for CD8\ufffd T cells that recognize the OVA epitope SIINFEKL (OVA257\u2013276) in the context of MHC class I molecules, whileOT-II mice are transgenic for CD4\ufffd cells that respond to theOVA323\u2013339 peptide ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR in the context ofthe MHC class II I-A2 molecule. BM-DC were infected with vari-ous combinations of carrier strains and expression cassettes, andthe proliferation of OT-I- and OT-II-derived T cells was deter-mined as a measure of antigen-dependent stimulation (Fig. 5).Compared to the control stimulation of T cells by concanavalin A,high levels of stimulation of OT-I cells were obtained with theSalmonella purD htrA carrier strain with the various expressioncassettes for SPI2 effector::OVA::HA. In contrast, stimulation ofOT-II cells was rather low under the various conditions investi-gated in this assay. This indicates that peptides derived from trans-located fusion proteins are predominantly presented in a MHCclass I-restricted manner. The highest stimulation was observedwith strains harboring SteC and SseJ fusion proteins.Fusion proteins with SseJ and SifA efficiently induce T cellresponses after vaccination in mice. To examine the effect ofSPI2 effectors on the in vivo immunogenicity of the recombinantvaccines, we used the purD htrA double-deficient strain MvP728,which harbored expression cassettes for the SPI2 effector-Llo fu-sion proteins under the control of PsseA. Mice were immunized byoral administration of the vector or vaccine strains followed bybooster immunizations on days 14 and 28. In order to quantify theimmune response to vaccination, blood samples were analyzed ondays 10, 21, and 35 after the initial immunization. The elicitationof Listeria monocytogenes antigen-specific cytotoxic T lympho-cytes (CTL) is a reliable correlate of protective immunity against L.monocytogenes infections in murine models (11, 14, 18, 25). Theproportion of Llo-specific CTL was determined using specificpentamers (Fig. 6). As previously reported, the immunizationwith SseF-Llo fusion induced specific CTL responses (25). Thequantification of Llo-specific CTL at the various time points in-dicted that strains translocating SteC-Llo or SseL-Llo fusion pro-FIG 2 Synthesis of fusion proteins with model antigens.

The strains were grown in SPI2-inducing minimal medium (phosphate, carbon, nitrogen minimal medium with 0.4 mM inorganic phosphate; pH 5.8), andbacteria were harvested after 6 h of culture under inducing conditions. Equal amounts of bacteria, adjusted by the OD600, were lysed and subjected to sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analyses for the detection of the HA epitope tag was performed. Blots wereprobed with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies, and signal intensities were quantified using the Odyssey system (Li-Cor). As a loading control, thecytosolic heat shock protein DnaK was detected on the same blot, and signals were quantified. Representative blots are shown. White boxes indicate the areas usedfor signal quantification. (C and D) The ratios of the HA to DnaK signals were calculated, and means and standard deviations for three samples are shown forOVA (C) and Llo (D) fusion proteins.

In con-trast, immunization with strains translocating SseJ-Llo or SifA-Llo fusion proteins induced increased numbers of CTL comparedwith SseF-Llo. The highest CTL frequency was detected in thegroup immunized with the SseJ fusion protein. These results in-dicate that effector proteins SteC and SseL are suboptimal for theuse in recombinant vaccines. In contrast, SseJ and SifA are supe-rior to the previously characterized effector protein SseF and canbe used for the translocation of heterologous antigens bySalmonella-based recombinant vaccines.DISCUSSIONPrevious work from others and our labs has demonstrated thebroad potential applicability of bacterial T3SS for the transloca-tion of heterologous vaccine antigens by live attenuated bacterialcarrier strains (19). Among multiple factors that contribute to thevaccine efficacy, the choice of a T3SS translocation signal or aT3SS effector protein as a fusion partner for the target antigens isof particular importance. Here, we compared the ability of fiveSPI2 effectors (SseJ, SifA, SteC, SseL, and SseF) to translocatemodel antigens in APCs and to elicit antigen-specific immuneresponse in vivo. We observed that the amount of translocatedprotein, as well as the stimulation of T cell responses under in vitroconditions, correlated well with the translocation efficacy of thevarious effectors. However, the T cell responses triggered in a vac-cination experiment were only in partial agreement with the ef-fects observed in vitro. SseJ consistently demonstrated the stron-gest activities both in vitro and in vivo. While stimulation of T cellresponses by fusion proteins based on SseJ was efficient in all assaysystems applied here, SseL did not appear to be useful for thegeneration of the fusion proteins with heterologous antigens inthe same settings. The results from in vitro and in vivo experimentswere only in partial agreement for fusion proteins based on SteCor SifA. While fusion proteins with SteC were efficiently translo-cated and stimulated T cell responses in \ufffd-Gal- or OVA-responsive T cells, the stimulation of Llo-responsive T cells invaccinated mice was not detectable.FIG 3 Translocation of fusion proteins by intracellular Salmonella. Wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium harboring plasmids with cassettes for theexpression of fusion proteins consisting of the SPI2 effector protein SseJ, SifA, SseL, or SteC and the model antigen Llo with a C-terminal HA epitope tag underthe control of PsseA were used to infect epithelial HeLa cells at an MOI of 10 or BM-DC at an MOI of 25.

The cells were fixed 16 h after infection and processed forimmunostaining.

Other parameters that will likely affect the efficacy oftranslocated recombinant antigens are the subcellular localizationof the translocated protein in APCs and the route of processing forpresentation. The proteins of the subgroup of SPI2 T3SS effectorsinvestigated in this study are all characterized by their associationwith endosomal membranes after translocation into host cells andtheir rather long half-life in host cells. Further work is required toFIG 6 Efficiency of SPI2 effector fusion proteins in vaccination. Cohorts of BALB/c mice were vaccinated with the purD htrA-deficient carrier strain MvP728harboring plasmids for the synthesis of fusion proteins consisting of various SPI2 effector proteins and a listeriolysin fragment. Blood samples were collected atdays 10, 21, and 35 after initial vaccination.

Immature DC can internalize and pro-cess S. enterica for peptide presentation on MHC class II as well asMHC class I, initiating an immune response (22). Interestingly, al-though S. enterica remains confined to vacuolar compartments, it canbe processed for MHC class I presentation of bacterial antigens toCD8\ufffd T cells (26). Because of the cytotoxicity of S. enterica to infectedcells, DC can be either direct or indirect presenters of S. enterica an-tigens. Direct presentation of bacterial antigens to T cells followsphagocytic processing of S. enterica, which does not induce cytotox-icity. Indirect presentation of bacterial antigens to T cells is a conse-quence of uptake by professional APCs of antigenic material fromneighboring cells that have undergone Salmonella-induced apoptoticdeath (22). Our results of the stimulation of OT-I and OT-II T cellsindicate that translocation of all fusion constructs results in MHCclass I- as well as MHC class II-restricted presentation. However, it isstill unknown how SPI2 T3SS effectors differ in their subcellular lo-calization and route of processing of heterologous antigens in DC. Arecent study indicated that a subgroup of SPI2 T3SS effector proteinshas DC-specific functions, such as interference with MHC class IIpresentation (7).The expression levels of genes encoding SPI2 effector proteinsare highly divergent, and this is likely to affect the amount of thetranslocated effector protein (24). By comparison of various pro-moters of the SsrAB regulon for expression of heterologous anti-gen fusions to SPI2 T3SS effector protein SseF, we recently iden-tified PsifB as a promoter with superior stimulation of immuneresponses to vaccination (25). In this study, we compared variousSPI2 effector proteins with high levels of synthesis for the translo-cation of fusion proteins. Here, the expression of the vaccine an-tigen fusions was controlled by PsseA, a promoter that has beenutilized in our previous approaches (11, 23). The comparison ofthe effector proteins SifA, SseJ, SteC, and SseL to the previouslydeployed effector SseF clearly revealed high levels of stimulation ofimmune responses by SifA and SseJ. Ongoing studies in our lab areexamining combinations of selected SPI2 promoters and effectorsfor optimal immunogenicity of the recombinant vaccines. In ad-dition to the selection of promoters for the controlled in vivo ex-pression of heterologous antigens and the SPI2 T3SS effector pro-tein, other parameters may affect vaccination efficacy. Recent workshowed that adaptation of the codon usage of foreign antigens to thecodon usage of Salmonella as a carrier strain can strongly affect levelsof protein synthesis and in turn the immune response to the antigen(23). Another important aspect is the selection of a suitable attenu-ated carrier strain. In the previous analysis and in this study, S. en-terica serovar Typhimurium strain MvP728 harboring deletions ofpurD and htrA was used. Other attenuated mutant strains are yet to betested for their compatibility with SPI2 T3SS-dependent transloca-tion of heterologous antigens.From results of this study we conclude that the choice of atranslocated SPI2 effector is an important parameter for theconstruction of efficient recombinant vaccines. However, thein vitro efficacy of the various SPI2 effectors only partly corre-lated with the immunogenicity observed in vivo. This discor-dance may be explained by several factors. (i) Carrier strainswith high levels of expression of heterologous antigens (e.g.,with SteC effector) could be more rapidly eliminated in vivo,resulting in reduced immune responses. (ii) The levels of syn-thesis of certain effectors are different under the in vivo and invitro conditions applied here. (iii) The subcellular location ofthe fusion protein under in vivo conditions is not favorable forefficient stimulation of immune response.In conclusion, our analysis showed that the choice of SPI2 effectorprotein as a vehicle for intracellular delivery of a target antigen is acritical parameter for the optimal design of Salmonella-based recom-binant vaccines. The in vivo vaccination efficacy of such SPI2 effectorsdid not completely match their in vitro performance. These resultsreflect the complex interplay between expression level, attenuation oflive carrier strains, and properties of the recombinant antigen in vac-cination of host organisms. Further mechanistic studies are requiredfor the comprehensive evaluation of these critical parameters for therational design of recombinant vaccinesACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by grant HE1964 of the Deutsche Forschungs-gemeinschaft to M.H., a fellowship of the DAAD to W.A.H.H., and grantsfrom the National Institutes of Health (P50 CA126752) and The CarolineWiess Law Foundation to L.M.
