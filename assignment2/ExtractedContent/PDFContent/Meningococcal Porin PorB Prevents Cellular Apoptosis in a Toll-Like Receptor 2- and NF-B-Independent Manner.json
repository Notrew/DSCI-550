Wetzler1Evans BioMedical Research Center, Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston University School ofMedicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118,1 and Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center, School of Medicine,Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 191402Received 10 February 2009/Returned for modification 26 March 2009/Accepted 8 December 2009Meningococcal porin PorB is an inhibitor of apoptosis induced via the intrinsic pathway in various cell types.This effect is attributed to prevention of mitochondrial depolarization and of subsequent release of proapop-totic mitochondrial factors. To determine whether apoptosis is globally inhibited by PorB, we compared theintrinsic and extrinsic pathways in HeLa cells. Interestingly, PorB does not prevent extrinsic apoptosis inducedby tumor necrosis factor alpha plus cycloheximide, suggesting a unique mitochondrial pathway specificity.Several intracellular factors regulated by NF-\ufffdB, including members of the Bcl-2 family and of the inhibitorof apoptosis (IAP) family, play major roles in controlling apoptosis, and some of them are thought to contributeto the antiapoptotic effect of the gonococcal porin, PIB. However, most of the members of the Bcl-2 family andthe IAP family are not induced by meningococcal PorB in HeLa cells, with the exception of Bfl-1/A1. Inter-estingly, PorB does not induce NF-\ufffdB activation in HeLa cells, likely due to a lack of Toll-like receptor 2(TLR2) expression in these cells. Bfl-1/A1 expression is also regulated by CBF1, a nuclear component of theNotch signaling pathway, independent of NF-\ufffdB activation. Since HeLa cells are protected by PorB fromintrinsic apoptosis events, regardless of TLR2 and NF-\ufffdB expression, the possibility of a contribution ofalternative signaling pathways to this effect cannot be excluded. In this paper, we describe an initial dissectionof the cascade of cellular events involved in the antiapoptotic effect of PorB in the absence of TLR2.Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is characterized bymorphological events, including membrane blebbing and nu-clear and chromatin condensation, and by intracellular events,such as activation of cytosolic proteins and DNA degradation(26). A variety of different intracellular stress signals can trig-ger apoptosis, including bacterial infections, excessive calcium,chemical substances, DNA-damaging agents (intrinsic or mi-tochondrial pathway), and cell surface death receptor activa-tion (extrinsic pathway). Both pathways are divided into threebasic phases: (i) initiation, (ii) commitment, and (iii) execu-tion, ending with cell death (71).Several intracellular protein families, such as the Bcl-2 fam-ily (40), caspases (8), and the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs)(16), play important roles in controlling apoptosis. Bcl-2 pro-teins have a dual role; they trigger apoptosis (Bax, Bak, andBid [1]) or block it (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 [39]).Proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can induce release of mitochon-drial factors, including cytochrome c (36), apoptosis-inducingfactor (AIF) (70), and Smac/DIABLO (18), in both a mito-chondrial membrane potential-dependent manner and a mito-chondrial membrane potential-independent manner (2, 25,74). These events lead to activation of caspase 9 and 6 (intrin-sic pathway) and subsequent DNA degradation. Alternatively,proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can also directly activate caspase 8(extrinsic pathway) (1, 68), but the two pathways converge at adownstream event, caspase 3 activation (24). AntiapoptoticBcl-2 proteins act mostly by modulating mitochondrial func-tions directly by interacting with mitochondrial components ofthe permeability transition pore or indirectly by neutralizingproapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (7, 69, 72). IAPs are a family ofproteins that directly inhibit caspase activation (16, 32) and,similar to Bcl-2 proteins, are also regulated by NF-\ufffdB (9).Modulation of apoptosis by several intracellular and extra-cellular bacteria, mostly to avoid normal host defense re-sponses, has been described previously. Many bacteria induceand/or prevent apoptosis, depending on the host cell type,growth conditions, or bacterial life cycle. Some examples ofbacteria that inhibit apoptosis are Chlamydia (20, 22, 79), Shi-gella flexneri (11), Brucella (28), Porphyromonas gingivalis (56,58), Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (4, 23, 31,42, 50, 55, 62, 65, 73). Our group and other workers havereported that live N. meningitidis and purified meningococcalporin inhibit apoptosis (15, 49, 50, 62, 75), potentially viamultiple mechanisms. While meningococcal infection inducesNF-\ufffdB-mediated upregulation of antiapoptotic genes, purifiedPorB and PorB from live bacteria directly interact with mito-chondria and modulate their membrane potential, preventingrelease of cytochrome c. N. gonorrhoeae and purified gonococ-cal porin PIB induce NF-\ufffdB-mediated upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes (4, 5, 23, 33, 55, 65), which could also contrib-ute to prevention of apoptosis.A correlation between the antiapoptotic effect of PorB andactivation of NF-\ufffdB has not been shown so far, although ourgroup has demonstrated that PorB activates NF-\ufffdB in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner (43, 46, 48, 52).Interestingly, various human and murine cell types are pro-tected from apoptosis by PorB (23. 49, 50, 51) regardless ofTLR2 expression.

HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco modifiedEagle medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \ufffdg/ml streptomycin. MeningococcalPorB was purified by column chromatography as previously described (51) and,for some experiments, was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) as previ-ously described (52). Staurosporine (STS), recombinant human tumor necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-\ufffd), cycloheximide (chx), propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma), rho-damine 123 (rh123) (Invitrogen), and parthenolide (PA) (EMD Biosciences)were used as described below.Induction of apoptosis and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was induced by incu-bating HeLa cells (105 cells/ml) with 1 \ufffdM staurosporine or with 20 ng/ml TNF-\ufffdplus 10 \ufffdg/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h. The mitochondrial membrane potentialwas measured by flow cytometry using cells stained with 1 \ufffdM rhodamine 123, aspreviously described (49). DNA degradation was determined by propidium io-dide staining of permeabilized cells, also as previously described (49). Cells wereanalyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuestacquisition and analysis software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Gat-ing was used to exclude cellular debris. Individual experiments were repeated atleast five times. Anti-TLR2 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antibody(eBioscience) was used for flow cytometry detection of surface expression ofTLR2 on HeLa cells.Cell activation assays. HeLa cells were treated with purified PorB (10 \ufffdg/mlor 50 \ufffdg/ml) or with TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) for various periods of time, as describedbelow. NF-\ufffdB inhibition studies were performed by adding parthenolide (10\ufffdM) (79) at 2 h prior to stimulation. The inhibitor concentration was determinedexperimentally as the concentration at which NF-\ufffdB was inhibited without in-duction of cell toxicity (using phase-contrast microscopy to examine cell mor-phology). In some assays, cells were also treated with Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml) orheat-killed N. meningitidis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50.Subcellular fractionation. Mitochondrial fractions were prepared as previ-ously described (49). For Golgi membrane fractions, the cells were lysed in 200mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), homogenized, mixed with 62% sucrose (finalsucrose concentration, 37.5%), and overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 mlof 29% sucrose in an SW55 centrifuge tube. After 90 min of centrifugation at50,000 rpm, Golgi membranes were harvested at the interface between 29%sucrose and 35% sucrose (41). Late and early endosome fractions were obtainedusing a sucrose step gradient as described previously (54). For nuclear andcytosolic fractionation, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer B (10 mM HEPES[pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMdithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30min and then centrifuged at 800 \ufffd g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants weredesignated cytosolic fraction and stored. The nuclear pellets were washed oncewith lysis buffer C (lysis buffer B containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40), designated thenuclear fraction, and stored. The total protein concentration of the cell fractionswas determined by using the Bio-Rad protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad,Hercules, CA). Whole-cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in lysisbuffer A (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20).Western blotting. For evaluation of intracellular proteins, equal amounts ofproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Western blotting.The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6)containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated in 5% bovine serum albuminin TBS-T overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following antibodies: anti-PorB rabbit serum(49), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12; Pharmingen), anti-Golgin, anti-Rab4(early endosome marker), anti-KDEL (late endosomes marker), anti-pro-caspase 3, anti-pro-caspase 7, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-AIF, andanti-p65/RelA (Stressgen); anti-Bfl-1 (Abcam); anti-Bid (Biosource); and anti-cIAP-2, anti-HSP70, anti-c-Rel, anti-Rel-B, anti-p100/p52, anti-p105/p50, anti-I\ufffdB\ufffd, and anti-H3 (Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouseor anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used, and the immunoreactive bandswere detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).Fluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells (104 cells/ml) were plated in completemedium on glass coverslips placed into six-well plates, allowed to adhere, andincubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB labeled with AlexaFluor 594. The cells were then washed five times, fixed with 3.7% paraformal-dehyde in warm medium for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, washed again, and permeabilizedwith 100% ice-cold acetone for 5 min. After further washing, the cells wereincubated with anti-cytochrome monoclonal antibody (1:1,000) for 30 min atroom temperature and then with anti-mouse FITC-labeled secondary antibody(1:5,000; Sigma). Following a final wash, the coverslips were mounted on glassslides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,CA) and stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C. The slides were examined by fluorescencemicroscopy using an Olympus BX41 fluorescent microscope attached to com-puterized imaging equipment, and the images were processed with Olympus DPController software.NF-\ufffdB luciferase reporter assay. HeLa cells (105 cells/ml) were plated in24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the cells weretransfected with an NF-\ufffdB luciferase reporter vector as previously described(10). Briefly, 450 \ufffdl of fresh medium containing 50 \ufffdl of GeneJuice (Novagen)plus 2 \ufffdl of the reporter plasmid preparation was incubated for 15 min at 25\u00b0Cprior to addition to the cells for overnight transfection. The following day, PorB(10 \ufffdg/ml), Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml), TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml), or heat-killed N. men-ingitidis at an MOI of 50 in fresh medium was added and incubated for 18 h, andthis was followed by measurement of luciferase activity using commercial re-agents (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The luminescence intriplicate wells was assessed using a Wallac Victor2 luminometer.IL-8 ELISA. Supernatants from HeLa cells or BEAS-2B cells incubated asdescribed above were collected, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production was mea-sured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a BD OptEIAh-IL-8 ELISA set (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.RESULTSMitochondrial localization of PorB is a time-sensitive,TLR2-independent event. Our group has previously shown thatmitochondrial colocalization of PorB occurs in HeLa cells after24 h of incubation and has demonstrated that there is a directassociation between PorB and the mitochondrial proteinVDAC (49, 50). We have also shown that TLR2 is a surfacereceptor for PorB (52), which might enhance intracellular de-livery of PorB in cells that express this receptor. However,HeLa cells lack TLR2 expression (78), and thus internalizationof PorB in these cells is likely to be TLR2 independent. Toexamine the kinetics of mitochondrial localization of PorBindependent of a (known) potential receptor-mediated inter-action, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB at37\u00b0C for 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h, and mitochondrial andcytosolic fractions were separated. Aliquots of equivalent pro-tein concentration were examined by Western blotting with ananti-PorB antibody, which demonstrated that there was a time-dependent association of PorB with mitochondria as soon asafter 30 min of incubation, which increased over time (Fig.1A). The PorB accumulation in the cell cytosol at the sametime points was negligible (Fig. 1A). Cytochrome c was used asa mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1A) and was not detected in thecytosolic fractions (not shown). Anti-HSP70 antibody was usedas a loading control (Fig. 1A). As a control for PorB internal-ization, whole-cell lysates were examined by Western blottingwith anti-PorB antibody (Fig. 1B). The potential interaction ofPorB with other intracellular compartments, such as the Golgimembranes or early or late endosomes, was also examined byWestern blotting of isolated organelles. PorB did not colocal-ize with the Golgi membranes after 24 h of incubation, while itwas widely associated with the fraction containing the remain-ing cellular membranes, including mitochondria (Fig. 1C).Golgi membranes were identified with an anti-Golgin antibody(Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when both early- andlate-endosome fractions were examined (not shown). The co-localization of PorB with mitochondria after 24 h of incubationhas been established previously by Western blotting and byVOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 995fluorescence microscopy (50). Here, the time-dependent asso-ciation of PorB with HeLa cells was examined by fluorescencemicroscopy of cells incubated with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB labeledwith the red fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 594 (52) for 1 h, 4 h,and 24 h; the cells were counterstained with an anti-cyto-chrome c monoclonal antibody, followed by a FITC-labeledsecondary antibody, and were examined by fluorescence mi-croscopy (magnification, \ufffd60). Figure 2 shows the time-depen-dent increase in the association of red fluorescent PorB withHeLa cells after 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2B, 2E,and 2H, respectively). FITC-stained cells are shown in Fig. 2A,2D, and 2G, and merged fluorescence images are shown in Fig.2C, 2F, and 2I.PorB prevents mitochondrial depolarization in a time-de-pendent manner. To examine whether protection from apop-tosis correlates with time-dependent PorB colocalization withmitochondria, HeLa cells were incubated simultaneously with1 \ufffdM staurosporine (STS) and PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 24 h orwere pretreated with PorB for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h prior toinduction of apoptosis. The mitochondrial membrane potentialwas measured by flow cytometry as function of uptake of rho-FIG. 1. Time-dependent intracellular localization of PorB.

As shown in all of the histograms in Fig. 3,HeLa cells incubated with medium alone displayed high levelsof rh123 fluorescence, indicating that there was an intact mi-tochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3, light gray area), sim-ilar to that of cells incubated with PorB alone (Fig. 3, thin line).Incubation with STS for 24 h induced mitochondrial depolar-ization, as shown by a low level of rh123 fluorescence, due tothe inability of the cells to retain the dye (Fig. 3, dark grayarea). Simultaneous addition of STS and PorB (Fig. 3A, thickline) or incubation of PorB for 1 h and 4 h prior to the additionof STS (Fig. 3B and 3C, respectively, thick line) did not preventmitochondrial depolarization, while this effect was reversed by24 h of preincubation with PorB (Fig. 3D, thick line). Mito-chondrial depolarization was also prevented by PorB in humanairway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, a naturally TLR2-express-ing human cell line (not shown) relevant for airborne organ-isms, such as N. meningitidis. Since PorB appears to colocalizewith mitochondria after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1A), thedelay in protection could suggest that a critical concentrationof mitochondrial PorB may be necessary. To address this pos-sibility, HeLa cells were incubated with a 5-fold-higher con-centration of PorB (50 \ufffdg/ml) for 4 h or 24 h prior to inductionof apoptosis. When 50 \ufffdg/ml of PorB was used, protectionfrom mitochondrial depolarization was observed after 4 h ofincubation with PorB (Fig. 3E, thick line), as well as after 24 h(Fig. 3F, thick line).Selectivity of PorB for the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Cel-lular apoptosis can be induced by a variety of different stimuli,which can activate the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. Stauro-sporine is an intrinsic inducer of apoptosis, and our previousstudies have shown that, due to protection from mitochondrialdepolarization, PorB prevents or reduces apoptotic eventsdownstream of mitochondria, such as caspase cleavage andDNA degradation (49, 50). In agreement with our previousresults, PorB prevented cleavage of pro-caspase 7 induced bySTS in HeLa cells, as shown by Western blotting of whole-celllysates with an anti-caspase 7 antibody (Fig. 4A). However,when apoptosis was induced via the extrinsic apoptosis path-way with TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (chx) (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 24 h, PorB did not prevent cleavage of pro-caspase 3and only minimally reduced the cleavage of pro-caspase 7 (Fig.FIG. 3. Time-dependent prevention of mitochondrial depolarization by PorB. Mitochondrial depolarization was examined by flow cytometryof HeLa cells stained with rhodamine 123, a mitochondrial potential-dependent fluorescent dye. Cells were (A) incubated with PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml)and 1 \ufffdM STS simultaneously, (B to D) preincubated with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB for (B) 1 h, (C) 4 h, or (D) 24 h, or (E and F) preincubated with50 \ufffdg/ml of PorB for (E) 4 h and (F) 24 h prior to addition of STS. In all the histograms, the fluorescence of cells treated with medium alone isindicated by the light gray area, the fluorescence of cells treated with PorB alone is indicated by the thin line, the fluorescence of cells treated withSTS is indicated by the dark gray area, and the fluorescence of cells treated with PorB and STS is indicated by the thick line. Gating was used toexclude cellular debris. The results are representative of the results of at least four independent experiments.VOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 9974A). An anti-HSP70 antibody was used to demonstrate equalloading of the samples.To determine whether PorB can prevent TNF-\ufffd- and chx-dependent mitochondrial depolarization, rh123 staining wasexamined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) asdescribed above. Mitochondrial depolarization induced byTNF-\ufffd and chx (Fig. 4B, dark area) was not prevented byincubation with PorB for 24 h (Fig. 4B, thick line). As ex-pected, mitochondrial depolarization was not detected in cellsincubated with medium alone or with PorB alone (Fig. 4B,light gray area and thin line, respectively). Since PorB canrescue HeLa cells from mitochondrial depolarization inducedby STS, a specific effect on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway ishypothesized. Apoptotic DNA degradation was also examinedby using incorporation of propidium iodide (PI), followed byquantification of cells with hypodiploid DNA by FACS analy-sis. PorB significantly prevented STS-induced DNA degrada-tion (approximately 50%) (Fig. 4C), while it did not reduceDNA degradation induced by TNF-\ufffd and chx. Figure 4C showsthe results of multiple experiments (n \ufffd 5), expressed as ratiosof DNA degradation compared to the data for medium controlcells.Effect of PorB on cellular proteins involved in apoptosis.The phenomena that describe prevention of intrinsic apoptosisby PorB might also suggest a potential contribution of thecellular apoptotic machinery, which is heavily regulated byboth proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2family. To address whether PorB has an inhibitory effect onproapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, the time-dependent expressionand intracellular localization of Bak, Bax, and Bid were exam-ined by Western blotting of lysates of whole cells incubatedwith PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h. Incubation withPorB for up to 24 h did not affect the expression of the mito-chondrial proapoptotic protein Bak, did not induce mitochon-drial accumulation of Bax, and did not induce cleavage of thecytosolic, full-length, inactive form of Bid (not shown). In ad-dition, the lack of mitochondrial cytochrome c and the lack ofapoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) released in the cell cytosolwere further indications of mitochondrial membrane integrity(not shown).Next, the effect of PorB on antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins wasexamined. A modest increase in expression of Bcl-2 was de-tected after 4 h of incubation with PorB, but the level returnedto the baseline level after 24 h (Fig. 5A), consistent with ourprevious results (50). Similar transient expression of Bcl-xLwas also detected (Fig. 5A). Only expression of Bfl-1 increasedin a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), in agreement with whatwas previously shown for gonococcal porin PIB in male ure-thral cells (5). As both live gonococci and purified PIB induceearly upregulation of c-IAP-2 gene expression (5, 23), thec-IAP-2 protein levels in response to PorB were examined.FIG. 4. PorB does not prevent extrinsic apoptosis. HeLa cells wereincubated with PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 24 h prior to induction of apoptosiswith 1 \ufffdM STS or with 20 ng/ml of TNF-\ufffd plus 10 \ufffdg/ml chx.(A) Cleavage of caspase 3 and 7 induced by STS is prevented by PorB.Caspase 3 cleavage induced by TNF-\ufffd and chx is not inhibited by PorB,and caspase 7 cleavage appears to be slightly reduced, as determinedby Western blotting of whole-cell lysates with anti-caspase 3 and anti-caspase 7 antibodies. Anti-HSP70 antibody was used as a loadingcontrol.

Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 were transiently expressed in re-sponse to PorB after 1 h or 4 h of incubation, and expression decreasedafter 24 h of incubation, while expression of Bfl-1 increased in atime-dependent manner. TNF-\ufffd was used as a positive control forinduction of protein expression, and HSP70 was used as a loadingcontrol.998 MASSARI ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.Figure 5A shows that transient expression of c-IAP-2 was de-tected, similar to expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.As a positive control for expression of these proteins uponcell activation, HeLa cells were incubated with TNF-\ufffd alone(20 ng/ml), which did not affect Bax, t-Bid, cytochrome c, andAIF (not shown), since TNF-\ufffd does not induce apoptosis inthe absence of chx. In agreement with previous findings, treat-ment with TNF-\ufffd alone induced increased expression of Bcl-2,Bcl-xL, Bfl-1, and c-IAP2 in a time-dependent manner in HeLacells (Fig. 5B). Loading of equal amounts of proteins wasdetermined with an anti-HSP70 antibody.Lack of NF-\ufffdB activation by PorB in the absence of TLR2.Most intracellular antiapoptotic factors are under transcrip-tional control of NF-\ufffdB, which therefore plays a major role inprevention of cell death (30). NF-\ufffdB activation is induced bywhole neisseriae and neisserial porins in various cell systems(5, 13, 21, 23, 27, 35, 59, 77); in particular, PorB induces NF-\ufffdBactivation in a manner dependent on TLR2 (46, 48, 52), areceptor that is not present in HeLa cells (78). To determinewhether PorB could induce TLR2-independent NF-\ufffdB activa-tion in these cells, multiple approaches were used. First, cellfractionation and Western blotting were employed to examineNF-\ufffdB protein levels in response to PorB. HeLa cells wereincubated with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h or withTNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) for 30 min as a TLR-independent positivecontrol. PorB did not induce expression and degradation ofI\ufffdB\ufffd (essential for release of active NF-\ufffdB) or expression oftotal intracellular NF-\ufffdB (p65/RelA) in whole-cell lysates inthe absence of TLR2 (Fig. 6A, left panel). As expected, I\ufffdB\ufffddegradation and p65/RelA expression were detected in re-sponse to TNF-\ufffd (Fig. 6B, left panel). An HSP70 antibody wasused as a loading control.To verify our findings, nuclear translocation of p65/RelAwas also examined by Western blotting of nuclear and cytosolicfractions. PorB did not induce p65/RelA nuclear translocationat early time points and appeared to slightly induce nucleartranslocation at 24 h (Fig. 6A, right panel). Incubation withTNF-\ufffd alone for 30 min was sufficient to promote p65/RelAnuclear translocation (Fig. 6B, right panel). An antihistoneantibody was used to determine the purity of the nuclear frac-tions. NF-\ufffdB subunits other than p65/RelA were also exam-ined by Western blotting. A small, time-dependent increase intotal p100 and p105 expression was detected in response toPorB after 24 h of incubation, but there was no significantnuclear translocation of the active NF-\ufffdB subunits (notshown). Collectively, these data suggest that PorB does notinduce significant NF-\ufffdB activation in HeLa cells, althoughintracellular accumulation of p105 and p100 precursors mayoccur.To correlate the biochemical evidence for a lack of TLR2-dependent NF-\ufffdB activation by PorB with functional activa-tion, HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reportervector under control of the NF-\ufffdB promoter (10), and lucif-erase production was examined. This approach has been usedpreviously to characterize TLR-dependent NF-\ufffdB activationby PorB in other cell systems (48, 52). Transfected cells wereincubated for 18 h with PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml), TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) asa TLR-independent positive control, Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml)as a TLR2-dependent control, and heat-killed N. meningitidis(MOI, 50) as an additional control. PorB and Pam3CSK4 didnot induce NF-\ufffdB-mediated luciferase production (Fig. 7A),while TNF-\ufffd and heat-killed N. meningitidis induced robustluciferase production (Fig. 7A). The results were expressed inFIG. 6. Lack of NF-\ufffdB expression and activation in HeLa cells byPorB. HeLa cells were incubated with PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 1 h, 4 h, and24 h or with TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, and NF-\ufffdB activation wasmeasured by Western blotting.

PorBand Pam3CSK4 did not induce IL-8 secretion (Fig. 7B) due tothe lack of TLR2 expression in these cells. TLR2-independentIL-8 production was induced by TNF-\ufffd and heat-killed N.meningitidis (Fig. 7B), in agreement with previous results. In-duction of IL-8 by PorB was also measured using BEAS-2Bcells, which respond to TLR2 ligands, including PorB (notshown).Control of mitochondrial potential by PorB is not dependenton NF-\ufffdB transcriptional activity. Although it appears thatNF-\ufffdB is not required for the antiapoptotic effect of PorB inHeLa cells, to determine whether inhibition of NF-\ufffdB activa-tion could interfere with this property, the sesquiterpene lac-tone parthenolide (PA) was used in the apoptosis assay. Var-ious concentrations of PA were tested for cell toxicity, and 10\ufffdM was chosen as a nontoxic concentration with significantNF-\ufffdB inhibition (not shown). As a control for the ability ofPA to inhibit NF-\ufffdB activation, HeLa cells were preincubatedwith 10 \ufffdM PA for 2 h prior to incubation with 20 ng/ml ofTNF-\ufffd for 30 min, and whole-cell lysates were examined byWestern blotting. I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation induced by TNF-\ufffd wasinhibited by PA (Fig. 8A), similar to p65/RelA nuclear trans-location (not shown). Anti-HSP70 antibody was used as a load-ing control.The effect of PA on the mitochondrial potential was exam-ined by using rh123 fluorescence and FACS. The mitochon-drial potential was not affected by treatment with PA (10 \ufffdM)alone for 24 h (Fig. 8B, gray dotted line) or by treatment withPA for 2 h followed by treatment with 10 \ufffdg/ml of PorB (Fig.8B, black dotted line), similar to the results for PorB alone(Fig. 8B, black line) and for medium alone (Fig. 8B, light grayarea). Induction of mitochondrial depolarization by STS (Fig.8C, dark gray area) was prevented by treatment with PorBalone (Fig. 8C, thin line) and by treatment with PA for 2 hfollowed by treatment with PorB for an additional 24 h (Fig.8C, thick line), demonstrating that inhibition of NF-\ufffdB doesnot affect the ability of PorB to prevent mitochondrial depo-larization.DISCUSSIONPreviously, our group correlated the antiapoptotic effect ofPorB with its direct interaction with the mitochondrial proteinVDAC and subsequent modulation of mitochondrial mem-brane potential (49, 50), an upstream event in the intrinsicapoptotic pathway. Since these initial observations, further ev-idence that purified neisserial porins and live Neisseria infec-tion inhibit apoptosis in various types of cells has been re-ported (4, 5, 23, 50, 55, 62, 65, 75). While the mechanism ofprotection from apoptosis by the gonococcal porin PIB ap-pears to involve activation of NF-\ufffdB and expression of anti-apoptotic genes (5), it is not clear whether similar cellular andmolecular mechanisms also regulate the antiapoptotic effect ofPorB. For example, PorB elicits NF-\ufffdB activation in a TLR2-and TLR1-dependent manner (48, 52) but prevents apoptosisin various cell types, regardless of the TLR2 expression level ortissue origin. Our group and others have reported PorB-medi-ated prevention of apoptosis in TLR2-competent cells (murineprimary B cells, B cell lines, and human female cervical epi-thelial cells), in TLR2-negative cells (HeLa cells), and in cellsexpressing low physiological levels of TLR2 (human airwayepithelial BEAS-2B cells) (53; P. Massari, unpublished obser-vations). The latter, a relevant cell type for infection withairborne pathogens, such as N. meningitidis, are susceptible toactivation by PorB (P. Massari, unpublished observations).Collectively, our observations so far suggest that PorB canprevent mitochondrial depolarization regardless of TLR2 ex-pression and signaling, likely via multiple mechanisms of cellactivation. These mechanisms include the known direct effectFIG. 8. Inhibition of NF-\ufffdB does not affect prevention of mito-chondrial depolarization by PorB. (A) HeLa cells were incubated withthe NF-\ufffdB inhibitor parthenolide (PA) (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 2 h and thenwith TNF-\ufffd (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, and inhibition of I\ufffdB\ufffd degradationwas examined by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates with an anti-I\ufffdB\ufffd antibody. Anti-HSP70 antibody was used as a loading control.(B) Analysis of the mitochondrial potential of HeLa cells incubatedwith PA as described above and then with PorB (10 \ufffdg/ml) for 24 h.The mitochondrial potential was measured by rh123 fluorescence andFACS analysis as previously described.

IMMUN.of PorB on mitochondria and potential activation of cellularantiapoptotic responses. To specifically exclude the contribu-tion of TLR2-dependent activation pathways to the antiapop-totic effect of PorB, here we examined the potential contribu-tion of the host cell machinery to this phenomenon using HeLacells, which lack TLR2 expression (78).First, we described a rapid, time-dependent interaction ofPorB with mitochondria. This interaction is not detected inother intracellular compartments, such as Golgi membranes orthe endoplasmic reticulum, in agreement with previous find-ings (50). Once PorB colocalizes with mitochondria, it preventsapoptotic mitochondrial membrane depolarization (49) by in-teracting with VDAC, a component of the permeability tran-sition pore (12) and possibly by interfering with the formationof contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrialmembranes (47). Since PorB colocalizes with mitochondriarapidly during incubation, one could imagine that its ability tomodulate mitochondrial potential is also forthcoming. How-ever, PorB did not prevent mitochondrial depolarization in-duced by STS prior to a 24-h preincubation. The delay inprotection might be explained by the necessity to accumulate acritical amount of PorB for mitochondrial membrane stabili-zation, and a 5-fold-higher dose of PorB prevented mitochon-drial depolarization at earlier time points.While mitochondrial depolarization has a primary role in theintrinsic apoptosis pathway, in the extrinsic pathway this pro-cess is either bypassed immediately (type I cells) or may am-plify the death signal via certain proapoptotic Bcl-2 familymembers (type II cells) (45, 63). We examined the effect ofPorB on extrinsic apoptosis induced in HeLa cells by TNF-\ufffd inthe presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.Our results demonstrate that PorB has a nonessential role inprevention of caspase activation upstream and downstream ofmitochondria in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Importantly,PorB did not rescue cells from secondary mitochondrial mem-brane depolarization, likely due to previous major apoptoticevents. These observations, combined with the evidence thatPorB nevertheless protects HeLa cells from STS-inducedapoptosis, indicate that there is a specific effect only on theintrinsic apoptosis pathway. Obviously, given that protectionfrom mitochondrial depolarization by PorB appeared to in-crease over time, the possibility that PorB induces intracellularfactors that have not been described so far cannot be excluded,despite the uncharacteristically long time necessary for cellularevents possibly regulated by signal transduction pathways. Thekey cellular players during apoptosis include Bcl-2 and IAPfamily members, which are activated mostly by cleavage or achange in intracellular localization and regulate release ofapoptotic mitochondrial factors in both a mitochondrial poten-tial-dependent manner and a mitochondrial potential-indepen-dent manner. Since PorB induces neither expression and trans-location of proapoptotic Bax, Bak, and Bid nor release ofcytochrome c and AIF, it is plausible that its antiapoptoticeffect is not due to inhibition of these factors. Nevertheless,antiapoptotic proteins could contribute to the properties ofPorB. However, PorB induced early and transient expressionof Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 in the first 1 h to 4 h of incuba-tion, in agreement with previous findings for gonococcal PIB inmale urethral epithelial cells (5). Whether these proteins areinduced only at early time points or are degraded at later timepoints is not clear. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 thus do not playa major role in PorB-mediated prevention of apoptosis. Inter-estingly, PorB induced stable, time-dependent expression ofBfl-1 (17), a suppressor of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis(64, 67, 76, 81) expressed in bone marrow and, at low levels, inother tissues. It has been shown that the gonococcal porin PIBinduces early upregulation of bfl-1 gene expression in a maleurethral epithelial cell model (5), similar to the findings forwhole N. gonorrhoeae incubated with female cervical epithelialcells (23). It is tempting to speculate that neisserial factors,including porins, are important for modulation of apoptosis intissues that are relevant for infection by these microorganisms,such as the reproductive tract or the airway epithelium. Theeffects of PorB and of whole N. meningitidis cells on cells of thehuman airway epithelia are currently being investigated. Bfl-1expression is transcriptionally regulated by an NF-\ufffdB-depen-dent complex containing AP-1 and C/EBP\ufffd and is dependenton a c-Rel/p50 heterodimer (19, 29, 38, 81), and NF-\ufffdB alsodirectly regulates a number of other cellular factors involved inapoptosis (3, 9, 57). Although PorB is known to activate NF-\ufffdBthrough TLR2 and TLR1 signaling (48, 52), we found that itdid not induce p65/RelA expression or I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation andinduced only minimal p65/RelA nuclear translocation in HeLacells. In addition, only some cytosolic accumulation of p105and p100 precursors was detected, but no nuclear translocationof these subunits was detected. The lack of functional NF-\ufffdBactivation in response to PorB and other TLR2 ligands wasconfirmed by the absence of NF-\ufffdB-dependent luciferase pro-duction and IL-8 secretion. The lack of TLR2 expression inHeLa cells may explain the inability of PorB to activate thesecells. In addition, PorB also did not activate NOD-transfectedHEK cells (66; R. Ingalls and P. Massari, unpublished obser-vations). Collectively, similar to findings for Chlamydia tracho-matis (20, 22, 79, 80), these observations argue against a majorrole for NF-\ufffdB transcriptional activation in the antiapoptoticeffect of PorB in HeLa cells (which does not induce I\ufffdB\ufffddegradation or p65/RelA nuclear translocation but induces p65cleavage to interfere with the host inflammatory response)(37). Although the lack of NF-\ufffdB activation might explain thelack of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 expression by PorB, induc-tion of Bfl-1 expression might be induced via NF-\ufffdB-indepen-dent transactivation of the bfl-1 gene, similar to what has beendescribed for Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells with EBV nuclear an-tigen 2 via CBF1 (or RBP-J kappa), a nuclear component ofthe Notch signaling pathway (60). Regulation of Bfl-1 in epi-thelial cells in the absence of NF-\ufffdB has not been described sofar, and this regulation in response to PorB should be investi-gated further.Inhibition of NF-\ufffdB with pharmacologic reagents can in-crease the susceptibility to apoptosis. However, the NF-\ufffdBinhibitor parthenolide (6) did not affect the antiapoptoticproperties of PorB, suggestiing that NF-\ufffdB has a marginal rolefor PorB in this process. The possibility that other signalingpathways (including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,PI3K/AKT [14], and Notch [34] pathways) contribute cannotbe excluded, since regulation of Bcl-2 family members hasbeen hypothesized for these pathways (44, 61). Further anal-ysis of the TLR2-independent signaling induced by PorB mightidentify a novel contribution of intracellular factors involved inprevention of apoptosis.VOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 1001ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by NIH/NIAID grant RO1 AI40944-01.We thank Ting Wu for technical assistance.REFERENCES1.
