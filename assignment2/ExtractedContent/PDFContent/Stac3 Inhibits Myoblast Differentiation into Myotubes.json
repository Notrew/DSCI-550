"pone.0095926 1..8Stac3 Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation into MyotubesXiaomei Ge., Yafei Zhang., Sungwon Park\u00a4, Xiaofei Cong, David E. Gerrard, Honglin Jiang*Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of AmericaAbstractThe functionally undefined Stac3 gene, predicted to encode a SH3 domain- and C1 domain-containing protein, was recentlyfound to be specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and essential to normal skeletal muscle development and contraction.In this study we determined the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, two important steps ofmuscle development. Neither siRNA-mediated Stac3 knockdown nor plasmid-mediated Stac3 overexpression affected theproliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes asevidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expressionof myogenic markers including myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited thedifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by decreased fusion index, decreased number of nuclei permyotube, and decreased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers. Compared to wild-type myoblasts, myoblastsfrom Stac3 knockout mouse embryos showed accelerated differentiation into myotubes in culture as evidenced byincreased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA expression of myogenic markers.Collectively, these data suggest an inhibitory role of endogenous Stac3 in myoblast differentiation. Myogenesis is a tightlycontrolled program; myofibers formed from prematurely differentiated myoblasts are dysfunctional. Thus, Stac3 may play arole in preventing precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletal muscle development.Citation: Ge X, Zhang Y, Park S, Cong X, Gerrard DE, et al.

Theprocess of formation of myofibers from muscle progenitor cells iscalled myogenesis, and this process is controlled by a set oftranscription factors, including Myf5, Mrf4, MyoD, and myogenin(MyoG). While Myf5 and MyoD determine the myogenic lineageof muscle progenitor cells [1\u20133], MyoG and Mrf4 drive theterminal differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, thedeveloping myofibers [4\u20137]. Skeletal muscle plays important rolesin initiating movements, supporting respiration, and maintaininghomeostasis; loss of skeletal muscle mass or function is associatedwith ageing and diseases such as cancer and diabetes [8,9].Skeletal muscle in meat-producing animals is a tissue of majoreconomic importance. Therefore, identification of new factors andmechanisms that control skeletal muscle development andphysiology has significant implications for improving humanhealth and animal productivity.The functionally undefined Stac3 gene appears to be a newfactor regulating skeletal muscle development and function. Thisgene is predicted to encode a protein containing two Src homologythree (SH3) domains and a cysteine rich (C1) domain [10]. TheStac3 gene is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle [10\u201314].Stac3 knockout in mice caused perinatal death and markedabnormalities in skeletal muscle [11,13]. In zebrafish, morpholino-mediated Stac3 knockdown resulted in defective myofibrillarprotein assembly [14]; absence of Stac3 expression due to amissense mutation in a splice donor site or morpholino-mediatedStac3 knockdown caused the fish to be immobile or shiver [12]. Itwas proposed that Stac3 plays a role in excitation-contractioncoupling through interaction with the dihydropyridine receptorand the ryanodine receptor [11,12].The function of Stac3 has also been studied in C2C12 myoblasts[14]. Bower and colleagues observed that Stac3 knockdownprevented C2C12 myoblasts from fusing into myotubes andconcluded that Stac3 is essential for myoblast differentiation andmyotube formation [14]. However, an essential role of Stac3 inmyoblast differentiation does not appear to be supported by thefacts that Stac3 knockdown or mutation did not prevent theformation of myofibers in zebrafish [12,14] and that Stac3knockout did not block the formation of myofibers in mice [11,13].In this study, we examined the role of Stac3 in myoblastdifferentiation and myotube formation by determining the effectsof Stac3 knockdown, overexpression, and knockout on myoblastdifferentiation and fusion into myotubes in both C2C12 myoblastline and mouse embryonic myoblasts. Our results suggest aninhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation and myotubeformation.PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095926&domain=pdfExperimental ProceduresCulture of C2C12 cellsC2C12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were expanded in growthmedium composed of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium(DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (ABAM) at 37 uC under 5% CO2. Differentiation wasinduced by replacing the growth medium with differentiationmedium consisting of DMEM, 2% horse serum, and 1% ABAM.Cell culture media and supplements were purchased fromMediatech Inc. (Manassas, VA) unless otherwise specified.Stac3 knockdownC2C12 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown toapproximately 70% confluence. Cells in each well were transfectedwith Stac3 siRNAs (MSS239387, MSS239388, MSS239389 fromInvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in combination of three (10 nM persiRNA) or separately (30 nM). Control cells were transfected with30 nM scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen). The transfection reagentwas Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Since an appropriate Stac3antibody was not available, knockdown efficiency was estimated byquantitative RT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA.Stac3 overexpressionStac3 cDNA was amplified from mouse skeletal muscle totalRNA and linked to a Flag tag at the 39 end via PCR using primers59-GAGGATCCGGGGCCCAATCTCTTGTAA-39 and 59-TCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCG-TAAATCTCCTCC-39. The Stac3-Flag fusion cDNA was clonedinto the pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHIand XbaI sites to generate the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag. Tooverexpress Stac3 in C2C12 cells, the cells at 70% confluencewere transfected with 0.5 mg of pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag usingLipofectamine 2000 as the transfection reagent. Transfection of anequivalent amount of pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) plasmid served as acontrol. Overexpression of Stac3 was confirmed by quantitativeRT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA and western blot analysis of Stac3-Flagfusion protein using an anti-Flag antibody (see details below).Stac3 mutant miceGeneration, breeding, and genotyping of Stac3 mutant micewere described in detail in a previous report [13]. Mice werehoused on a timed 12 h light/dark schedule with free access tostandard rodent diet and water. All procedures involving animalswere approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee.Isolation and culture of myoblasts from mouse embryosMouse embryonic myoblasts were isolated as described [15],with minor modifications. Briefly, limb muscles from embryonicday 17.5 (E17.5) embryos were dissected and digested in a solutionconsisting of 1.5 U/ml collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 2.4U/ml dispase (Roche), and 2.5 mM CaCl2 at 37 uC for 30minutes. The released cells were collected by centrifugation andresuspended in Ham\u2019s F-10 medium supplemented with 20% FBS,2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega, Madison, WI),and 1% ABAM. The cells were allowed to attach to the plates for 2h at 37 uC. The medium containing the unattached cells wastransferred to collagen I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences, San Jose,CA). When the cells reached 50% confluence, they were subjectedto 3 to 5 times of 20-min preplating or until 70% of them wereestimated to be myoblasts [16]. To induce differentiation, cells at80% confluence were switched to DMEM medium supplementedwith 2% horse serum and 1% ABAM.Quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated using TRI reagent according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions (Molecular Research Center, Cincin-nati, OH). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed essentially asdescribed previously [13]. Stac3, myogenin (Myog), myosin heavychain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb), troponin T type 1 (Tnnt1),troponin T type 3 (Tnnt3), and creatine kinase, muscle (Ckm)mRNAs were quantified by PCR using primer pairs 59-TACAGCGACCAACAGTACGC-39 and 59-TCTGCATTGT-TTCCATCCTG-39; 59-CGGCTGCCTAAAGTGGAGAT-39and 59-AGGCCTGTAGGCGCTCAA-39; 59-CGCAGAATCG-CAAGTCAATA-39 and 59-ATATCTTCTGCCCTGCACCA-39; 59-ATGTGAGGGCCAGAGAAAGG-39 and 59-TCCAGG-TACTTGACCGGGAT-39; 59-AAACCCAGCCGTCCTGTG-39 and 59-TCATCTCCCGACCAGTCTGT-39; 59-GCCCAA-GAGGAAGAAGTCCA-39 and 59-TAGCTGCTGTAGTTGG-CACC-39; and 59-CGCAGCATCAAGGGTTACAC-39 and 59-AGGTGCTCGTTCCACATGAA-39, respectively. mRNA abun-dance was calculated as relative to 18S rRNA, which wasquantified by RT-PCR using primers 59-TTAAGAGGGACG-GCCGGGGG-39 and 59-CTCTGGTCCGTCTTGCGCCG-39.Based on the Ct values, expression of 18S rRNA was not different(P.0.1) between the conditions used in this study.ImmunocytochemistryCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeated with 0.25% TritonX-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blockedwith 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (PBS + 0.05%Tween-20) and incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC)antibody (MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) at 1:200 dilution at 4uCovernight. The anti-MHC antibody was detected by incubatingthe cells with anti-mouse IgG FITC antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) at 1:200 dilution at room temperature for 1 h. Cellnuclei were stained by incubating the cells in 1 mg/ml DAPI(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 min at room temperature. Fluorescence wasdetected with a Nikon eclipse E600 florescence microscope (NikonMetrology, Inc., Brighton, MI).Cell proliferation assayThe numbers of viable cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiationof culture were measured using the nonradioactive CellTiter 96assay kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s (Promega) instructions.The absorbance at 570 nm reflected the number of viable cells.Cell proliferation rate was represented by the slope of the line thatconnected the absorbance at different times in culture.Characterization of myotubesTo visualize myotubes and nuclei, differentiating myoblastswere washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10min. Cells were then stained with Giemsa (Invitrogen) for 10 min.Total cell nuclei and nuclei within myotubes were counted usingthe NIH ImageJ software. A muscle cell containing 3 or morenuclei was considered as a myotube, as defined previously [17].Fusion index was calculated as the number of nuclei in myotubesdivided by the total number of nuclei counted. Average number ofnuclei per myotube was determined by dividing the number ofnuclei in myotubes by the total number of myotubes.Western blot analysisTotal cellular protein lysates were prepared and western blotanalyses were conducted essentially as described previously [18],Role of Stac3 in Myoblast DifferentiationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926except that the primary antibodies were detected using IRDyesecondary antibodies at 1:20,000 dilution (LI-COR, Lincoln,Nebraska) and the ODYSSEY CLx system (LI-COR). Thefollowing primary antibodies were used: anti-myosin heavy chainMF20 at 1:500 dilution (Developmental Studies HybridomaBank), anti-myogenin F5D at 1:500 dilution (DevelopmentalStudies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-b-actin N21 at 1:1,000dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Statistical analysesTwo-tailed student\u2019s t test was used to determine thesignificance of the difference between two groups. The differencesbetween more than two groups were analyzed by ANOVAfollowed by Tukey HSD multiple comparisons. These tests wereperformed using the JMP software (SAS, Cary, NC). A differencewas considered significant when the associated P value was lessthan 0.05. All data were expressed as means 6 s.e.m. (standarderror of the mean).ResultsStac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12myoblasts into myotubesWe investigated the potential role of Stac3 in myoblastproliferation by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Stac3 in C2C12myoblasts. Transfecting these cells with a pool of three siRNAstargeting Stac3 mRNA decreased the expression of endogenousStac3 mRNA by 65% as compared to the transfection of ascrambled siRNA (P,0.01, Fig. 1A). However, Stac3 siRNAs hadno effect on the proliferation rate of C2C12 myoblasts (P.0.1,Fig. 1B). To determine the potential role of Stac3 in myoblastdifferentiation, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3 siRNAsor scrambled siRNA were induced to differentiate, and theirdifferentiation status was assessed by measuring the fusion indexand average number of nuclei per myotube. At 72 h ofdifferentiation, more C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3siRNAs formed myotubes than those transfected with scrambledsiRNA (66% vs. 40%, P,0.05; Fig. 1C and 1D). Myotubes formedfrom Stac3 siRNAs-transfected C2C12 myoblasts had more nucleion average than those from scrambled siRNA-transfected C2C12myoblasts (19 vs. 7 nuclei/myotube, P,0.01, Fig. 1C and 1E).These morphological data indicated that Stac3 knockdownstimulated the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.We also assessed the differentiation status of C2C12 myoblastsby measuring the mRNA levels of 6 myogenic markers includingmyogenin (Myog), myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb),troponin T type 1 and 3 (Tnnt1 and Tnnt3), and creatine kinase,muscle (Ckm), and the protein levels of 2 myogenic markersincluding myogenin (MyoG) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) at 0,24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation. The cells transfected with Stac3siRNAs had greater expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1,Tnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those transfected with scrambledsiRNA at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation (P,0.05, Fig. 1F).The former cells also had greater expression of MyoG and MHCproteins than the latter at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation(Fig. 1G). These myogenic marker expression data furtherindicated that Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation ofC2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.To validate the specificity of the effect of siRNA-mediated Stac3knockdown on myoblast differentiation, the three Stac3 siRNAsused as a pool in the above experiments were transfectedindividually into C2C12 myoblasts. These transfections decreasedStac3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A) and increased the fusion index(Fig. 2B and 2C) and mRNA expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb,Tnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm (Fig. 2D) in a similar manner totransfection of the three siRNAs in combination. These data ruledout the possibility that off-target effects mediated Stac3 siRNAs-enhanced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts.Stac3 overexpression inhibited the differentiation ofC2C12 myoblasts into myotubesWe also determined the effect of Stac3 overexpression onproliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. We achievedStac3 overexpression by transfecting the cells with a Stac3-Flagfusion protein expression plasmid and confirmed Stac3 overex-pression at both the mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B) levels.Stac3 overexpression did not alter the proliferation rate of C2C12myoblasts (P.0.1, Fig. 3C). At 72 h of differentiation, approxi-mately 25% of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the Stac3-Flagexpression plasmid formed myotubes, whereas this percentage wasnearly 40% for those transfected with the empty vector (P,0.05,Fig. 3D and 3E). Myotubes formed from Stac3-overexpressingC2C12 myoblasts had 4 nuclei on average, whereas those formedfrom control cells had 7 nuclei (P,0.05, Fig. 3D and 3F). At 48and 72 h of differentiation, myotubes formed from Stac3-overexpressing C2C12 myoblasts had less expression of Myog,Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those formedfrom C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the empty vector (P,0.05, Fig. 3G). The former cells also expressed less myogeninprotein than the latter at 24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation, andless myosin heavy chain protein than the latter at 48 and 72 h ofdifferentiation (Fig. 2H). These changes caused by Stac3overexpression were opposite to those caused by Stac3 knockdownin C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1).Myoblasts from Stac3 mutant mouse embryos showedaccelerated differentiation in cultureWe isolated myoblasts from E17.5 Stac3 homozygous mutantmouse embryos and wild-type littermates and compared theirpotential to differentiate into myotubes in culture. QuantitativeRT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of Stac3 mRNA inmyoblasts from Stac3 homozygous mutant embryos (Fig. 4A). At72 h of differentiation, 53% of Stac3 mutant myoblasts fused intomyotubes, whereas this percentage was much lower (18%) forwild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and 4C). On average,myotubes formed from Stac3 mutant myoblasts contained 2 morenuclei than those from wild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and4D). These morphological differences indicated that Stac3 mutantmyoblasts differentiated more rapidly than wild-type myoblasts inculture. At 72 h of differentiation, Stac3 mutant myoblastsexpressed 50 to 150% more Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1, andTnnt3 mRNAs than wild-type myoblasts (P = 0.2 to 0.3; Fig. 4E).DiscussionIn this study we determined whether Stac3 plays a role inmyoblast proliferation and differentiation in two myogenic cellsystems: C2C12 myoblast line and primary murine myoblasts.While Stac3 knockdown had no effect on proliferation of C2C12myoblasts, it stimulated their differentiation into myotubes, asevidenced by increased fusion rate, increased average number ofnuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expressionof myogenic markers including myogenin, the myogenic regula-tory factor that controls the terminal differentiation of myoblastsinto myotubes [4,7]. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibitedthe differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, asevidenced by decreased fusion rate, decreased average numberof nuclei per myotube, and decreased mRNA and proteinRole of Stac3 in Myoblast DifferentiationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926expression of myogenic markers. Judged by the number and size ofmyotubes formed, myoblasts from Stac3-null mouse embryosdifferentiated more rapidly in culture than wild-type myoblasts.These results imply an inhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblastdifferentiation into myotubes.Our finding that Stac3 inhibits C2C12 t differentiation intomyotubes is seemingly at odds with an earlier report concludingthat Stac3 is essential for myotube formation from C2C12 cells[14]. The cause for this discrepancy is not clear. It could be due tothe different culture conditions or different passage numbers ofC2C12 cells, which are difficult to control, used between the twostudies. However, an essential role of Stac3 for myotubeformation, as concluded in the earlier study [14], is not supportedby the phenotypes of Stac3 knockout mice and Stac3 knockdownzebrafish, where myofibers clearly are formed [11\u201314]. Aninhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation into myotubesindeed can explain some of the phenotypes in Stac3 knockoutmice. Skeletal muscle of Stac3 knockout mice had fewer yet largermyofibers and had a disproportional number of myofibers withlarge cross-sectional areas [13]. In theory, the increased size inmyofibers can be caused either by hastened myoblast differenti-ation and fusion into myotubes or by hypertrophy of fusedmyotubes. However, it is unlikely that Stac3 mutant myotubeswere undergoing hypertrophy because they indeed had fewer andsmaller myofibrils than wild-type or Stac3 heterozygous mutantmyotubes [13]. The relative number of proliferating myoblastsversus differentiating myoblasts during muscle developmentdetermines the total number of myofibers formed in maturemuscle [19,20]. If myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle andbegin differentiation before an adequate number of foundermyoblasts have developed, this will decrease the overall number ofmyofibers formed. Therefore, hastened myoblast differentiationand fusion into myotubes could also explain why Stac3 knockoutskeletal muscle had fewer total myofibers than wild-type or Stac3heterozygous mutant skeletal muscle [13].Figure 1.

(n = 3 independentRole of Stac3 in Myoblast DifferentiationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926In summary, the present study suggests that, in myoblasts, Stac3plays a role in inhibiting the differentiation of these cells intomyotubes. Myogenesis is a tightly controlled program; prematuremyoblast differentiation would lead to the formation of dysfunc-tional myofibers [21,22]. Thus, Stac3 could be one of those factorsthat prevent precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletalmuscle development. Obviously, the mechanism by which Stac3inhibits myoblast differentiation into myotubes is an interestingfuture question to investigate. The SH3 domain contained in theStac3 protein is a classical protein-protein interaction domain[23,24]; therefore, Stac3 might inhibit myoblast differentiationthrough interaction with other proteins. It would be interesting toknow if Stac3 interacts with or affects the expression of proteinssuch as Delta-like protein 1, myogenin, MRF4 (Myf6), Stat1, andStat3 that are known to play a role in normal or prematuremyoblast differentiation [21,22,25].cell cultures).

Effect of Stac3 knockout on differentiation of embryonic mouse myoblasts. Myoblasts from limb muscles of E17.5 Stac3homozygous mutant (Stac3-/-) or wild-type (WT) mouse fetuses were isolated, expanded and enriched in growth medium, and induced todifferentiate into myotubes in differentiation medium. (A) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Stac3 mRNA in Stac3 mutant and wild-type myoblasts. (B)Representative images of Stac3 mutant and wild-type myoblasts at 72 h of differentiation. Myotubes were stained with anti-myosin heavy chain(MHC) antibody (green), and cell nuclei with DAPI (blue). (C) Fusion index at 72 h of differentiation. (D) Average number of nuclei per myotube at 72h of differentiation. (E) Relative expression levels of myogenin (Myog), myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb), troponin T type 1 (Tnnt1) and 3(Tnnt3), and creatine kinase, muscle (Ckm) mRNAs at 72 h of differentiation.
