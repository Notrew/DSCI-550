"Genome-wide incorporation dynamics reveal distinct categories of turnover for the histone variant H3.3Kraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121RESEARCH Open AccessGenome-wide incorporation dynamics revealdistinct categories of turnover for the histonevariant H3.3Daniel C Kraushaar1\u2020, Wenfei Jin1\u2020, Alika Maunakea1, Brian Abraham1, Misook Ha2 and Keji Zhao1*AbstractBackground: Nucleosomes are present throughout the genome and must be dynamically regulated toaccommodate binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase machineries by various mechanisms. Despitethe development of protocols and techniques that have enabled us to map nucleosome occupancy genome-wide,the dynamic properties of nucleosomes remain poorly understood, particularly in mammalian cells. The histonevariant H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication and requires displacement of existingnucleosomes for its deposition. Here, we measure H3.3 turnover at high resolution in the mammalian genome inorder to present a genome-wide characterization of replication-independent H3.3-nucleosome dynamics.Results: We developed a system to study the DNA replication-independent turnover of nucleosomes containing thehistone variant H3.3 in mammalian cells. By measuring the genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 at different time pointsfollowing epitope-tagged H3.3 expression, we find three categories of H3.3-nucleosome turnover in vivo: rapid turnover,intermediate turnover and, specifically at telomeres, slow turnover. Our data indicate that H3.3-containing nucleosomesat enhancers and promoters undergo rapid turnover that is associated with active histone modification marks includingH3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z. The rate of turnover is negatively correlated withH3K27me3 at regulatory regions and with H3K36me3 at gene bodies.Conclusions: We have established a reliable approach to measure turnover rates of H3.3-containing nucleosomes on agenome-wide level in mammalian cells. Our results suggest that distinct mechanisms control the dynamics of H3.3incorporation at functionally different genomic regions.BackgroundIncorporation of histone variants into chromatin critic-ally influences the properties of nucleosomes that playimportant roles in regulating transcription and epigeneticmemories [1-6]. The histone variant H3.3 differs fromcanonical H3 by a few amino acids and is ubiquitouslyexpressed in eukaryotes. Different from canonical histoneH3, which is expressed in S phase and is incorporated intochromatin during DNA replication, H3.3 can be incorpo-rated into chromatin independent of DNA replication[7,8]. The incorporation of histone variants is tightly regu-lated by histone chaperones. The H3.3-specific chaperones* Correspondence: zhaok@nhlbi.nih.gov\u2020Equal contributors1Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH,Bethesda, MD, 20892, USAFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\u00a9 2013 Kraushaar et al.; licensee BioMed CentCommons Attribution License (http://creativecreproduction in any medium, provided the orAtrx-Daxx and HIRA deposit H3.3 primarily at telomeresand non-heterochromatic regions, respectively [9-12]. Des-pite small differences in amino acid sequence betweenH3.1, H3.2 and H3.3, each is distributed differentially acrossthe genome and carries its own characteristic histone modi-fication signature, strongly suggesting distinct functionalroles for each H3 variant [9]. Histone marks that areassociated with gene activation, such as acetylation marksand H3K4me3, are typically found on H3.3 whereasH3K27me2 and H3K9me3 are found on H3.2 [13]. Marksassociated with gene silencing are predominantly foundon H3.1. However, the precise relationship between H3.3deposition and transcription are not well understood. InDrosophila, H3.3 replaces H3 during gene activation andbecomes deposited in active chromatin and especially veryhighly expressed ribosomal DNA [14,15].

Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 2 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121with gene activity and H3.3 is generally associated withthe transcription start site (TSS), transcription end site(TES) and gene bodies of active genes [16], although theunique chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) alsocarries H3.3 at promoters of certain inactive genes [1,9].In spite of their independent evolution, plant H3.3 andH3.1 display a broadly similar distribution to animal H3variants, which indicates a conserved function for H3variants [17]. Nucleosome occupancy and positioning arecritical to regulating gene transcription and epigenomemaintenance [18,19]. In mammalian cells, although nu-cleosomes are present at promoters and enhancers, theymust be dynamically regulated to accommodate bindingof transcription factors and RNA polymerase machineriesby various mechanisms [20-23].Intrinsic nucleosome characteristics such as inclusionof histone variants as well as extrinsic factors such asATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling, the transcriptionalmachinery and various other factors shape the dynamicprofile of nucleosomes [24,25]. Despite the developmentof protocols and techniques that have enabled us tomap the genome-wide nucleosome occupancy, their dy-namic properties are only poorly understood. Our currentunderstanding of the dynamics of nucleosomes comesfrom studies performed in yeast and Drosophila. Trans-genic epitope-tagged histones can be inducibly expressedto estimate nucleosome turnover and allow detection ofspecific histone incorporation [26-28]. Alternatively, newlysynthesized, native histones can be metabolically labeledwith an amino acid analogue that is coupled to an affinitytag (CATCH-IT), which allows for detection of H3/H4tetramers [29]. Using these strategies, it has been shownthat nucleosome exchange is rapid at promoters andcoding regions, and relatively slower at heterochromaticregions. Furthermore, differential turnover can be quitelocalized. For instance, faster nucleosome turnover hasbeen detected at Trithorax-group binding sites than atpolycomb group protein binding sites [26,30].Apart from the measurement of turnover, inducibleexpression systems with tagged histones have also con-tributed to our understanding of mechanistic aspects thatpertain to histone deposition. For instance, studies fromyeast have shown that Asf1 is required for the depositionof H3 and that the amino termini of both H2B and H3are not required for their incorporation into nucleo-somes [27,28].While these techniques measure average histonedeposition rates across cell populations, alternative tech-niques such as FRAP and SNAP-tag have allowed thedeposition of histones in individual cells to be visual-ized [31-33].The genome-wide turnover of the histone variant H3.3in mammals has not been studied up until now. GlobalFRAP studies in HeLa cells with green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged histones revealed only cycling of H2B.Canonical H3 and H4, in contrast, exhibited very slowcycling, and the majority of H3 remained permanentlybound outside S phase [33]. Slow turnover of core his-tones may be a feature of somatic cells since core histoneexchange is substantially more rapid in pluripotent ESCsthan in differentiated cell types [34]. Hence, fast turnovermay be inherently linked to cell plasticity.In this study, we developed a versatile technique tomap the dynamics of histone variant incorporation intochromatin in mammalian cells. Using this technique, wemapped the replication-independent incorporation of thehistone variant H3.3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(MEFs). We were able to track H3.3 incorporation acrossa relatively short time window of several hours afterinduction of H3.3 as well as over a longer time frameof up to 72 hours. By combining our chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-based technique with high-throughputsequencing, we measured the H3.3-nucleosome turnoverkinetics at the genome-wide level. Our results reveal threemajor categories of H3.3 nucleosome turnover: (1) rapidturnover at enhancers and promoters; (2) intermediateturnover at gene bodies; and (3) slow turnover at hetero-chromatic regions. We find faster H3.3 turnover at en-hancers and promoters is positively correlated with activehistone modifications, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3,H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z, whereasslower turnover is negatively correlated with H3K27me3and H3K36me3 modifications. These results show thatdistinct mechanisms of histone deposition and evictionpertain to the dynamics of nucleosomes at different func-tional chromatin regions. We also show that turnover isrelated to the presence of specific histone marks, stronglysuggesting that histone modifications are important deter-minants of nucleosome stability.ResultsAn ectopic expression system to measure turnover of H3.3In order to track histone incorporation and thereby assaythe genome-wide dynamics of the histone variant H3.3, wegenerated MEFs that carry a cytomegalovirus-controlledtetracycline (TET) transactivator and hemagglutinin (HA)/FLAG-tagged H3.3 expression cassette controlled by tetra-cycline response elements. This TET-ON expression systemallowed us to induce the expression of a HA/FLAG-taggedversion of H3.3 by addition of the tetracycline analog doxy-cycline (DOX) (Figure 1A). In our tetracycline inducible-HA/FLAG-H3.3 MEF cell line, we detected robust H3.3expression as early as 2 hours after DOX addition thatcontinued to increase until 48 hours after DOX addition.No tagged H3.3 expression was detected in the absence ofDOX (Figure 1B). Immunoblotting against H3.3 revealedthat transgenic H3.3 expression levels were only a smallfraction of those of endogenous H3.3. Furthermore weFigure 1 A versatile system to study replication-independent nucleosome dynamics in mammals. (A) Schematic of TET-inducible expressionsystem to study H3.3 turnover.

After 18 hoursof aphidicolin treatment (time point 0) and across thetime course of HA/FLAG-H3.3 induction, the MEF cellpopulation was essentially devoid of cells in S phaseand arrested at the G1/S phase boundary, as indicatedFigure 2 (See legend on next page.)Kraushaar et al.

Thus, to monitor the genome-wide dy-namics of replication-independent H3.3 incorporation,we induced HA/FLAG-H3.3 expression in cells arrestedby aphidicolin, followed by ChIP-Seq analysis using theHA antibody at various time points. We took a \u2018high-resolution\u2019 approach by tracking histone incorporationacross hourly time points of early protein expressionand across a longer time frame of up to 48 hours.Genome-wide characterization of H3.3 incorporationIn order to characterize the genome-wide deposition ofHA-H3.3, we sought to map the H3.3 distribution 72 hourspost-induction. Consistent with previous reports fromHeLa and mouse ESCs [1,9], we found that H3.3 isstrongly enriched in promoters, 5\u2019 UTRs, as well as the3\u2019 ends of genes (Figure 2A,B,F). In terms of read density,promoters and TES regions were overrepresented in theH3.3-enriched genomic regions (Figure 2A). The majorityof H3.3 peaks were detected at introns followed by peaksin intergenic regions (Figure 2B). In line with the idea thatH3.3 carries primarily active histone modifications [13],we found strong overlap of H3.3 with the distributionprofiles of histone modifications such as H3K4me1,H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac. In contrast we detectedsubstantially fewer regions of H3.3 incorporation at sitesenriched with H3K27me3 (Figure 2D, 2E). Since the vastmajority of sharp H3.3 peaks in introns and intergenicregions were associated with enhancer marks, includingH3K4me1, H3K27ac and H2A.Z, we considered them asputative enhancers in the following analyses.Although most of the repetitive elements showed obviousdepletion of H3.3, high levels of H3.3 were detected attelomeres, rRNA and tRNA repeats (Figure 2C). H3.3co-localizes with pericentromeres in several differentiatedcell types [10]. We, however, did not find significantdeposition of HA-H3.3 at pericentromeric regions. Thisstrongly suggests that H3.3 deposition in these regionsis a strictly replication-coupled process as we profiledthe distribution of HA-H3.3 from cell cycle arrested andnon-dividing cells.To test the relationship between H3.3 incorporationand gene expression, we plotted the average profiles ofH3.3 across several groups of genes sorted according totheir expression levels (Figure 2F). Unlike in mouse ESCs,we found that H3.3 is associated mostly with active genesand not inactive genes.Enrichment levels of H3.3 at TSSs, gene bodies andTESs were positively correlated with the transcriptionlevel of the associated genes (Figure 2F). Interestingly,we find that the relation between HA-H3.3 enrichmentand gene expression follows a bimodal distribution atpromoters. Only promoters of expressed genes carrysubstantial amounts of H3.3, and H3.3 enrichment levelsdo not increase further at even higher expression levels.In contrast, HA-H3.3 enrichment in gene body and TESregions was strongly positively correlated with gene ex-pression levels. This indicates that H3.3 in gene bodiesmay be directly transcription coupled, whereas othermechanisms of H3.3 deposition may exist upstream ofTSSs. As a control alongside H3.3, we generated a MEFcell line that expressed canonical HA-H3.1 instead ofHA-H3.3, which differs in five amino acids from H3.3,and mapped its replication-coupled deposition. ChangingH3.3 to H3.1 abolished the defined enrichment of H3.3to a homogenous distribution similar to reads mappedfrom input samples, confirming its universal depositionthroughout the mammalian genome (Figure 2E). Fur-thermore, the pronounced pattern of H3.3 enrichmentaround the TSS, gene body and TES was lost. Slightlyhigher levels of H3.1 were detected around the TSSsof inactive and low-expressed promoters, indicatingprevalence of H3.1 at inactive genes (Figure 2G). Simi-lar genome-wide ChIP-Seq profiles were obtained byGoldberg et al. [9] with zinc finger-targeted, heterozy-gously tagged H3.3B in ESCs: mutating HA-H3.3 toHA-H3.2 or to a HA-H3.1S31 hybrid altered the H3distribution to a genome-wide pattern similar to thatof input samples or ChIP-Seq profiles obtained withantibodies against general H3.H3.3 displays early and late chromatin incorporationThe above results indicated the steady-state enrichmentof H3.3 across the genome. In order to measure turn-over rates of H3.3, we profiled the dynamics of HA-H3.3incorporation after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24 and48 hours of DOX treatment (Figure 3A). Using a linearregression model, we calculated a turnover index forFigure 3 H3.3 nucleosomes display fast and slow turnover rates.

A substantial number of sharp peaksappeared within 2 to 3 hours of DOX induction andreached their maximum enrichment well before the endpoint of the induction (Figure 3A,C). The subsequentdecline in read numbers that was observed at peaks withrapid H3.3 deposition may be a result of \u2018read shifting\u2019.Kraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 7 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121As the total read coverage becomes saturated, morereads may shift to peaks, which appear at later stages ofinduction. Importantly, this way, sites of enrichmentmay be identified, which would otherwise go undetectedin a steady state. Meanwhile, we also observed manybroad peaks, mainly in transcribed gene body regions,which took 12 to 24 hours to be detected (Figure 3A,C).Plotting the distribution of turnover rates revealed theexistence of two populations of H3.3 peaks with slowturnover and fast turnover, respectively (Figure 3D).Figure 4 Promoters and enhancers are associated with fast H3.3 nuclregions are associated with slow H3.3 nucleosome turnover.

The analysis re-vealed that 5\u2019 UTR and promoter regions generally havethe highest turnover indices; enhancers have the secondhighest, and 3\u2019 UTR and TES regions have the lowestturnover indices (Figure 4A).

Notableincorporation of HA-H3.3 was detected at the promoterregion within 3 hours. Further increases in deposition ofHA-H3.3 were observed within 6 hours at the TSS andthe majority of genes reached their maximum by 12 hoursbefore starting to decline (Figure 4B,D). Remarkably,the onset of HA-H3.3 deposition at gene bodies wasnot detected any time before the 6-hour time point(Figure 4C,E). H3.3 deposition at gene bodies continuedto increase from 12 hours to 72 hours of induction,when it reached the steady-state level. It is interestingto note that the signal of HA-H3.3 at the TSS exhibiteddecreases from 12 hours to 72 hours.High turnover of H3.3 in promoter regions of activegenes suggests that nucleosome turnover may be corre-lated with transcriptional activation. Further examinationof turnover rates at promoters indeed showed a modestbut positive correlation with gene expression levels(Figure 4F). The relationship between promoter turnoverand gene transcription suggests additional mechanisms bywhich nucleosome exchange facilitates and/or is facilitatedby gene activation.To further examine variation of the H3.3 turnover rateswithin each genomic category, we plotted the distributionof turnover indices separated into these categories(Figure 4G). The analysis revealed a relatively narrowrange for the high turnover at promoters and 5\u2019 UTRsand slow turnover at gene bodies and 3\u2019 UTRs, respect-ively, suggesting that the H3.3 nucleosome exchange inthese regions are controlled by distinct mechanisms atthese respective sites (Figure 4G). Interestingly, enhancerregions exhibited broad variability with regards to theirturnover rates, indicating that not all regulatory regionsare marked by high nucleosome turnover. Instead add-itional factors such as histone variants or histone modi-fications may contribute to nucleosome stability andturnover.Rapid H3.3 nucleosome turnover is associated with activehistone marks at promoters and enhancersSeveral studies have shown that H3.3 is enriched in tran-scriptional regulatory regions such as promoters andenhancers [1,9,15]. Consistent with these observations,we found that many H3.3 peaks are co-localized withactive histone modification marks, including H3K4me1,H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variantH2A.Z, that are often associated with promoters andenhancers (Figure 2D,E) [1,35,36]. To elucidate therelationship between H3.3 nucleosome turnover andhistone modifications, we sorted all H3.3 peaks basedon their turnover rates and displayed histone modifi-cation signals using heatmaps. The analysis indicatedthat faster turnover rates are generally associated withhigher levels of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27acand H2A.Z, whereas slower turnover is associated withhigher levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5A). More quantitativeanalyses confirmed that indeed H3.3 peaks with higherlevels of active modifications are turned over faster. Incontrast, H3.3 peaks associated with heterochromaticmarks such as H3K9me2 and repressive marks such asH3K27me3 are turned over slower (Figure 5B).To understand the differences between the enhancerswith fast H3.3 turnover and those with slow H3.3 turn-over (Figure 4G, black line), we compared the histonemodifications associated with these two groups of enhancers(Additional file 1). The analysis revealed that enhancersthat displayed high turnover carried significantly highermedian levels of active chromatin marks whereas enhancersof low turnover carried higher levels of H3K27me3(Additional file 1). Unexpectedly, our data indicated anegative correlation between H3.3 turnover and H3K36me3levels (Figure 5A,B), in line with the idea that H3K36me3stabilizes nucleosomes in order to prevent cryptic tran-scription [37,38].To evaluate the relative contribution of individual histonemodifications to turnover rates, we compared the group ofenhancers associated with all five active modifications togroups missing single histone marks. The results indicatethat the turnover rates decreased significantly by missingany of the active modifications (Figure 5C). Consistent withthis observation, association with only one of thesemodifications increased the turnover rates compared tothe enhancers without these modifications (Figure 5D).In contrast to these active modifications, inclusion ofeither H3K27me3 or H3K36me3 substantially decreasedthe turnover index of H3.3 nucleosomes (Figure 5E).In summary, we find that H3.3 exchange rate is posi-tively correlated with active chromatin modifications(H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H2A.Z)and negatively correlated with repressive marks (H3K9me2and H3K27me3). While the steady-state level of H3.3 ispositively correlated with H3K36me3, its turnover rateis negatively correlated with H3K36me3.The kinetics of HA-H3.3 incorporation at tRNA andrRNAs genesWe found that HA-H3.3 is enriched in tRNAs and rRNAgenes (Figure 2C). The incorporation of HA-H3.3 wasapparent from 6 hours of induction and continued toincrease till 24 hours before it started to decline at48 hours (Figure 6A). The incorporation of HA-H3.3 atrRNA genes was apparent at 12 hours and reached itsmaximum at 48 hours (Figure 6B). Both tRNA and rRNAexist as tandem repeat regions, are highly expressed andare transcribed by Pol III and Pol I, respectively. Pol III-transcribed genes share many epigenetic characteristicsFigure 5 Fast turnover rates are associated with active histone modifications.

Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 9 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121with Pol II transcribed genes, such as presence ofH3K4me1/2/3 and absence of H3K27me3 [39]. Hence,high turnover at tRNA and rRNA repeats is consistentwith our previous result that demonstrated high H3.3-nucleosome turnover at sites marked with active histonemarks. High nucleosome exchange may directly facili-tate accessibility of Pol III-specific transcription factorsTFIIIB and TFIIIC to provide functional promoters andassist in transcriptional initiation.Slow H3.3 replacement in telomeresCompared to promoters, enhancers, gene body regions,tRNAs and rRNAs, the incorporation of HA-H3.3 attelomeres exhibited the slowest rate. It was detected atFigure 6 Different repetitive sequences display distinct H3.3turnover rates.

Heterochromatic regions are expected to havestable nucleosomes and most of their histone exchange isexpected to take place during S phase. Yet, we observedslow rates of HA-H3.3 replacement at telomeres outsideS phase, indicating slow replication-independent histoneexchange that may be necessary for maintenance oftelomeric stability. It is known that repetitive features oftelomeres and pericentromeres have a relatively lowaffinity for nucleosomes and this may contribute to his-tone displacement [40].DiscussionNucleosome dynamics and histone turnover are not wellunderstood in mammals. In this report, we have devel-oped a robust, TET-inducible system to study the kineticsof genome-wide deposition of the histone variant H3.3in MEF cells. Using this system, we were able to measureturnover rates of genome-wide H3.3 target sites and wereable to infer important differences between turnover ratesof various genomic regions. Several categories of H3.3deposition kinetics were observed: invariably high turn-over at promoters, a broad range of turnover rates atenhancers, and slow turnover at gene bodies. In addition,repeat elements displayed dramatically different turnoverrates with relatively high turnover at tRNA and rRNA ele-ments and very slow H3.3 exchange at telomeres. Theseresults provide novel insights into the genome-wide turn-over of H3.3-containing nucleosomes and suggest distinctmechanisms of nucleosome assembly, stability and evictionin order to fulfill their function in regulating transcriptionand maintaining chromatin stability and integrity.Genome-wide incorporation of H3.3Unlike canonical histones, the histone variant H3.3 canbe deposited onto chromatin in a replication-independentmanner [7,8]. It is enriched in transcriptionally active re-gions, such as gene bodies and promoters and enhancersof mammalian cells [1,9]. Incorporation of H3.3 intochromatin destabilizes the nucleosome structure andmay facilitate transcriptional activation by generating amore accessible chromatin configuration [1,2]. Its de-position at promoters as well as in gene bodies is asso-ciated with epigenetic inheritance and may contributeto epigenetic memories [3,16].Our analysis of H3.3 distribution at the steady staterevealed its presence at intergenic regions that overlapwith histone modifications that typically mark enhancers,such has H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H2A.Z, in addition tothe enrichment at TSS regions. In coding regions, wefind that H3.3 is broadly distributed within the genebody of actively transcribed genes as well as TESs andregions immediately after. This association is well corre-lated with gene expression levels as has been reportedfrom other cell lines [1,9]. At promoter regions we findstrong differences in H3.3 enrichment between inactiveKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 11 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121genes and active genes but relatively moderate differ-ences between different expression groups, which followsan almost bimodal distribution. Based on H3.3 incorpor-ation studies that followed H3.3 incorporation over timeit was suggested that H3.3 incorporation at promoterswas constitutive as only minor increases in H3.3 enrichmentwere observed upon interferon stimulation [16]. Ourdata argue against a direct transcription-coupled mech-anism of incorporation at promoters as expression levelsand enrichment levels are bimodal, which further suggeststhat the H3.3 incorporation may function upstream ofthe transcriptional activation. Enrichment of H3.3 withingene body regions and at the TES showed strong correla-tions with transcription levels, in line with the notion thatH3.3 incorporation in gene bodies is directly coupled toelongation. The ChIP-Seq profiles between gene bodyH3.3 and Pol II are highly similar. Furthermore, a physicalinteraction between HIRA and Pol II has been demon-strated and provides further testament for a direct linkbetween H3.3 deposition and transcriptional elong-ation [32]. The role of H3.3 deposition in gene bodiesremains unclear but may be implicated in conferringepigenetic inheritance in order to facilitate constitutivetranscription of genes after cell replication has takenplace.Dynamics of H3.3 incorporation and differential turnoverOur results on the dynamics of H3.3 incorporation revealedthree basic modes of H3.3 deposition kinetics. The mostdynamic exchange of H3.3 was observed at promotersand enhancers. Robust signals of induced H3.3 weredetected within 2 to 3 hours of induction at these regula-tory regions, which is consistent with the rapid nucleo-some turnover at chromatin boundaries observed in yeast[26]. The second category of intermediate-rate incorpor-ation of newly induced H3.3 was found at gene bodyregions of active genes. The incorporation of H3.3 togene bodies became apparent at 12 hours and reacheda maximum at 72 hours. The slowest incorporation ofH3.3 was detected at telomeres, with detectable H3.3deposition at around 24 to 48 hours post-induction. Suchdifferential turnover suggests that multiple mechanismsof H3.3 deposition and displacement occur, which nodoubt will become subject to further investigation.The fast turnover at enhancers and promoters may in-volve histone chaperones such as HIRA and Atrx-Daxxand other chromatin remodeling enzymes as well assequence-specific transcription factors. High turnoverat promoters suggests that high nucleosome turnover isa pre-requisite for binding of the transcriptional ma-chinery as well as transcription factors.The concept of nucleosome versus transcription fac-tor competition has been well established from thePho5 promoter in yeast [19,23,41]. Without stimulation,nucleosomes are bound to the binding sites of the trans-activator Pho4 and effectively repress expression of thegene. Only upon release of nucleosomes at the promotercan Pho4 bind to its target site and gene activation ef-fectively occur [23]. Unlike in yeast, active promoters ofmammalian cells are occupied by nucleosomes [20]. Sowhat is the role of their turnover? It is attractive tospeculate that nucleosomes sterically compete with DNAbinding factors and that accessibility can only be grantedwhen nucleosome turnover is high [26].Although simple nucleosome depletion could accom-plish accessibility, \u2018transient\u2019 nucleosome deposition maystabilize DNA integrity, which may be necessary foraccurate transcription factor binding. Several familiesof transcription factors, so-called \u2018pioneer factors\u2019 [42],require the presence and \u2018guidance\u2019 of nucleosomes forproper binding and subsequent nucleosome remodeling[43]. Secondly, nucleosomes and their histone modifica-tions provide docking stations for a variety of transcriptionfactors and chromatin remodeling factors, which mayrequire continuous recruitment for initiation of transcrip-tion. Continuous nucleosome turnover may allow foraccessibility and nucleosome binding for chromatin fac-tors at the same time, which could be facilitated by thepresence of multiple active modifications at enhancersor promoters. In contrast, repression of transcriptionand epigenetic inheritance may require greater stabilityof nucleosome organization and thus slower turnoverat these sites, which, in turn, could be facilitated by associ-ation with polycomb group proteins and H3K27me3modification [30].The modest rate of H3.3 incorporation in gene bodiesand TES regions is closely related to active transcription,and the accumulative signals of H3.3 in these regionsmay require multiple rounds of transcription of a geneunit. It is generally thought that RNA polymerase displacesnucleosomes during elongation, as it cannot pass by nucle-osomes ahead of it [44,45]. Nucleosomes must be replacedbehind passing RNA polymerase in order to maintain thefidelity of transcription and avoid cryptic transcription [46].Unlike other histone chaperones, HIRA possesses uniqueDNA binding properties that allow it to bind to nakedDNA. Due to its physical association with Pol II, a \u2018gapfilling\u2019 mechanism has been proposed by which HIRAunder the guidance of PolII will fill protective H3.3-nucleosomes into spaces of naked DNA [32]. Our studyreaffirms the continuous eviction and replacement ofH3.3-containing nucleosomes during transcription. Slowexchange of these nucleosomes likely enhances chromatinstability before nucleosomes are evicted during a newround of transcription. H3K36me3 is placed by SET2-related enzymes following active transcription and playsa role in facilitating nucleosome deacetylation [37,47].Histone deacetylation stabilizes nucleosomes and thusKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 12 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121may result in the observed negative correlation betweenH3K36me3 level and H3.3 turnover in gene body regions.Our analyses suggest that heterochromatic regions turnover more slowly than euchromatic regions. We observedvery slow turnover at telomeres and no turnover at allat pericentromeric regions, both of which are known tobe enriched in H3.3. This suggests that pericentromericnucleosomes are replaced only during replication, whereastelomeres undergo continuous exchange of their nucleo-somes. Continuous exchange of nucleosomes at telomeresmay be necessary for telomeric maintenance, althoughbulk telomeric nucleosomes may be exchanged duringreplication.In summary, we have provided the basis for our under-standing of nucleosome dynamics in mammals by pro-viding a detailed picture of genome-wide replacement ofthe histone variant H3.3. This study will provide theplatform for further studies into the determinants andmechanisms of nucleosome exchange.ConclusionIn this study, we mapped the genome-wide H3.3-specificnucleosome occupancy and the dynamic turnover of thishistone variant in mammalian cells. We found that H3.3turnover rates vary dramatically across functionally dis-tinct genomic regions: turnover was highest at promotersand enhancers, intermediate at gene bodies and slowestat telomeres. Furthermore, we delineated striking correla-tions between turnover rates, histone modifications andH2A.Z, suggesting that intrinsic nucleosome propertiessuch as histone modifications and histone variant inclu-sions are important properties of nucleosome stability.Materials and methodsCell line derivationcDNA of human H3.3B or mouse H3.1 (Hist1h3h) wassubcloned in-frame with a HA and FLAG tag at thecarboxyl terminus and cloned into the lentiviral plvx-Tight-Puro Vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).Lentiviral particles were packaged in 293 T cells with thepsPAX2 packaging plasmid. Subsequently, we transducedNIH/3 T3 Tet-On\u00ae 3G cells (Clontech) and drug-selectedwith puromycin for stable integration.Western blottingCells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and whole-cell lysateswere resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellu-lose membranes, and blotted with anti-HA (Roche, Basel,Switzerland), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,USA) antibodies at 1:1,000. For anti-H3.3 western blot-ting, histones were isolated by acid extraction as describedin [48] prior to immunoblotting with an anti-H3.3 anti-body (Abcam, ab62642, Cambridge, UK). The anti-H3.3antibody recognizes serine 31 of H3.3, which is notpresent on either H3.1 or H3.2, but cross-reactivity withother histone variants has not been tested experimen-tally (Abcam).Cell cycle analysisCells were examined for BrdU incorporation with theBrdU Labeling and Detection kit (Roche). For furthercell cycle and DNA content analysis, cells were fixed with70% ethanol, and subsequently stained with 50 \u03bcg/ml pro-pidium iodide in 0.1% PBS-Triton-X with 0.2 mg/mlRNase A before analysis by flow cytometry.Time course induction and preparation of ChIP-Seq/RNA-SeqlibrariesNIH/3 T3 MEFs were cultured in standard conditions withmedium containing TET-compatible fetal bovine serum.MEFs were grown to 100% confluence and treated with1 \u03bcg/ml aphidicolin for 18 hours. Adding 3 \u03bcg/ml doxy-cycline hyclate before crosslinking with formaldehydeat various time points induced HA/FLAG-H3.3 expres-sion. ChIP-Seq experiments were performed as describedpreviously [49] with an antibody against HA. In order tocorrelate HA/FLAG-H3.3 turnover with the presence ofhistone modifications and/or gene expression levels, weprepared ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq from cells that weretreated with aphidicolin for 18 hours prior to crosslinkingand cell lysis.Data analysisChIP-Seq read mapping and peak callingChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome(mm9, or NCBI 37) using Bowtie [50], only allowing\u2018one read per position\u2019 matching. Redundant reads wereremoved from each ChIP-Seq library. We identified ChIP-Seq tag-enriched peaks using SICER [51], which takesadvantage of the enrichment information from neigh-boring bins to identify spatial clusters of signals that areunlikely to appear by chance. In this way, we could iden-tify the dispersed epigenomic domains such as broadH3.3 domains on gene bodies. For calling of H3.3 peaks,we set the window size to 200 bp and gap size to 600 bp.Peaks with a false discovery rate higher than 0.01 wereexcluded from the analysis, compared with the inputcontrol libraries.Analysis of H3.3 enrichment in genic regions and repetitiveelementsThe RefSeq gene annotation (mm9 or NCBI37) was down-loaded from the UCSC browser. The mouse genomewas classified into 5\u2019 UTR, exon, intron, 3\u2019 UTR andintergenic based on the UCSC annotation. Then we de-fined another two categories: promoter (3 kb upstreamof the TSS) and TES (from TES to 5 kb downstream).The total mapped reads in each category were normalizedKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 13 of 15http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121to its total length. All mouse consensus repetitive elementsequences, including pericentromeric element, L1, SINE1and telomeric element, were obtained from Repbase Up-date (RU) [52]. The relative enrichment of H3.3 in eachcategory of repetitive element was calculated by the pro-portions of reads mapped to repetitive elements normal-ized over input.H3.3 peak annotation and distribution profilingWe used the position of the center of each peak for peakannotation. Two peaks from different libraries were con-sidered as overlapping if the overlapped region accountsfor 10% of the length of one peak. We classified geneswith RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per millionreads) <1 as lowest (inactive) genes and the other genesas active genes. We grouped genes into five categorieswith equal numbers of genes (highest, high, intermediate,low, lowest) based on their RPKM values. For each gene,reads falling in peaks were counted according to theirshifted positions in 50 bp windows for the regions from3 kb upstream of the TSS to the TSS and from the TESto 5 kb downstream of the TES. Within gene bodies,reads falling in peaks were counted according to theirshifted positions in windows equal to 1% length of eachgene. The number of reads in each window was normal-ized by the total number of bases within the window, andthe total number of peak-filtered reads in the correspond-ing sample to obtain a normalized read-tag density.RNA-Seq data analysisThe reads from RNA-Seq libraries were mapped to themouse genome (mm9, or NCBI37) using TopHat [53], afast splice junction mapper. The gene expression levelwas measured by RPKM.Quantifying peak dynamicsThe total number of H3.3 peaks was identified by peak-calling at the 72-hour time point when both early appear-ing and late appearing peaks were readily detected. Thenumber of reads in each of these peak regions was re-corded and normalized over the total mapped reads foreach ChIP-Seq library. The relative H3.3 enrichment ofeach peak was calculated by normalizing the normalizedreads in the peak over the normalized reads in input. Alinear regression model was used to calculate turnoverindices (TI) for each individual peak. Assuming that en-richment of H3.3 at 0 hour is E0, then Et = TI \u00d7 t + E0,where Et equals H3.3 enrichment at each time point (E1,E2, E3,\u2026En), t = time point (1, 2, 3,\u2026n). For peaks thatreached their maximum enrichment before the end timepoint of analysis (t = 72 h), multiple linear regression co-efficients were calculated by fitting the end time pointsfrom time point of maximum enrichment to 72 h andt was adjusted correspondingly. We adopted the regressioncoefficient with the best fit (smallest P-value) as theturnover index of the peaks. The turnover index wasscaled from 0 and 1 in order to compare the reproduci-bility between duplicate experiments.Accession numbersOur ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data sets have been depositedin the Gene Expression Omnibus data base with accessionnumber GSE51505.Additional fileAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
