Our aim was to determine the distribution of IL-19 expression and to delineate the cell types thatexpress IL-19 in healthy and neoplastic tissue, because this information will significantly facilitate theexploration of its pathophysiological functions. We used tissue microarray technology and an immuno-histochemical survey with an anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibody to examine the expression of IL-19 in 28healthy and 15 neoplastic tissues. IL-19 protein was positively stained in 15 healthy tissue types andthree major cell types: epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. We also found that severaltypes of tumor cells were positively stained for IL-19, especially in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ofthe skin, tongue, esophagus, and lung. SCC of the oral cavity expressed IL-19 mRNA and its receptors.In two cell lines derived from SCC of oral cavity tumor tissue, IL-19 specifically activated an intracellularsignal and induced proliferation of the cells, which indicated that IL-19 may act in an autocrine manner inSCC tumors. This study provides important references for further investigation of the biological functionsand clinical implications of IL-19 in humans.\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionInterleukin (IL)-19, a recently discovered interleukin [1], be-longs to the IL-10 family: IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 (MDA-7), and -26 (AK155). Despite a partial homology in their amino acid se-quences, they are dissimilar in their biological functions [1\u20135]. Atpresent, only a few biological functions and clinical implicationsof IL-19 are known. One important cellular source of IL-19 aremonocytes, in which lipopolysaccharide (LPS), granulocyte\u2013macro-phage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, and tumor necro-sis factor (TNF)-a upregulate IL-19 expression [6,7]. Although thefunctions of IL-19 are not well understood, we do know that it in-ll rights reserved.5 from the Chi-Mei MedicalNational Science Council,Biochemistry and Molecularof Medicine, Tainan 70428,Chang).duces monocytes to produce IL-6 and TNF-a [8] and CD4-positive(+) T cells to produce Th2 cytokines, which are associated withasthma [9]. IL-19 also induces apoptosis in lung epithelial cells,stimulates liver cells to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS),and promotes neutrophil chemotaxis [10]. Clinically, IL-19 is in-duced in post-cardiopulmonary bypass inflammatory responseand severe sepsis, which indicates that IL-19 may be involved inthe pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory diseases [7,10]. Fur-thermore, IL-19 dose-dependently upregulated IL-4 and downreg-ulated interferon (IFN)-c [11], which suggested that IL-19 alteredthe balance of Th1 and Th2 cells in favor of Th2 cells. The expres-sion of IL-19 is also correlated with Th2 cytokine production in pa-tients with uremia [12].IL-19 has been found in the local tissue of inflammatory lesions.Human psoriatic epidermis tissue samples showed prominentIL-19 immunostaining in their hyperproliferative keratinocytes[13]. In addition, IL-19 upregulated keratinocyte growth factor(KGF) expression in CD8+ T cells [13], which suggested that IL-19is involved in modulating keratinocyte proliferation. Moreover,the difference in IL-19 expression between healthy and diseasedmailto:mschang@mail.ncku.edu.twhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666Table 2Tumor cells stained for IL-19 in neoplastic tissueTumor type IL-19 immunostaining1.

Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228tissue may help to clarify the function of IL-19 in clinical patho-physiology. There are currently no published comprehensive sur-veys of IL-19 expression in healthy or diseased human tissue orcell types.A recently developed tissue microarray (TMA) technology\u2014aminiaturized pathology archive for high-throughput in situ studies[14,15]\u2014allows a massive acceleration of correlating molecular insitu findings with clinicopathological information. Sections fromTMA blocks can be used for different types of in situ tissue analysis,including immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization [14\u201316]. The tissue microarray approach is useful in surveys of tumorpopulations and can be used to comprehensively analyze the func-tions of newly identified genes in both healthy and neoplastic hu-man tissue [15\u201317]. To explore the relation between IL-19 andbiological functions in human, we developed monoclonal antibod-ies against human IL-19. Using TMA and immunohistochemicalstaining with these antibodies, we surveyed IL-19 expression inhealthy and neoplastic human tissues.2. Materials and methods2.1. Human tissue microarraysCommercialized tissue microarrays (TMAs) (Pantomics, Inc, SanFrancisco, CA) with 28 types of healthy human tissue (Table 1)were used for immunohistochemical staining. The TMAs were de-signed following the FDA-recommended healthy tissue panel forantibody cross-reactivity testing described in the manufacturer\u2019sTable 1Immunostaining of IL-19 in healthy tissueEpithelialcellsEndothelialcellsMacrophagesa Others1.

Tumor TMAs were obtained from the PathologyDepartment of the National Cheng Kung University Medical Col-lege. Fifteen neoplastic (Table 2) tissue samples, formalin-fixedand paraffin-embedded, were retrieved from the archive. Therewere three samples of each healthy and neoplastic tissue type,one each from different donors. The TMAs were constructed usinga custom-made arrayer described elsewhere [14].2.2. Malignant tumor samplesFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded malignant tumor sampleswere retrieved from the archive: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)of the skin, oral cavity, esophagus, and lung; renal cell carcinoma(RCC); infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) of the breast; hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC); and adenocarcinoma of stomach and colon. Eightor nine cases of each tumor were retrieved. Whole sections of eachtissue block were prepared for the immunohistochemistry study.2.3. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)Human tissue samples obtained from the Tumor and SerumBank of Chimei Medical Center were used to analyze the tran-scripts of IL-19 and its receptors, IL-20R1 and IL-20R2. Each typeof tissue included three samples from different donors. The totalRNA of the selected tissue was extracted using RNA-Bee isolationreagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Oligo(dT)21-primedfirst-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase.We used PCR to amplify IL-19 and its receptors\u2019 transcripts fromcDNA. The sense primer (50-gct gcg tga cca aga acc tcc tgg-30)and antisense primer (50-tag act ctg gtg gca ttg gt-30) were usedfor IL-19. The sense primer (50-agc tgg aca gcg aag gaa ta-30) andantisense primer (50-agt gtg tga cca acc aca cg-30) were used forIL-20R1. The sense primer (50-gaa gtg gcc att ctg cct gcc-30) andantisense primer (50-ggg aat ggc ctc tcc ttg cac-30) were used forIL-20R2. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels con-taining ethidium bromide.2.4. Expressing and purifying IL-19 recombinant proteinA cDNA clone coded for the human IL-19 sequence from leucineto leucine (amino acids 25\u2013176) was inserted into the expressionvector of Pichia pastoris (pPICZ-a; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Weused affinity chromatography to express and purify human IL-19from the culture medium of the yeast cells. This protein was usedto generate monoclonal antibodies as described below.C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228 2232.5. Generating mouse monoclonal antibodies against human IL-19Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against human IL-19(1BB1) were generated as previously described [9]. Selecting andcharacterizing mAb against human IL-19 followed the standardprotocols [18]. We determined the epitope specificity of a panelof mAb by testing the ability of pairs of mAb to bind simulta-neously to the antigen in ELISA. In brief, the capture antibodywas attached to a solid substrate; the antigen (IL-19) was then at-tached to the substrate, and the ability of the biotin-labeled detec-tion antibody to bind with the antigen was monitored.2.6. ImmunohistochemistryParaffin-embedded-tissue slides with microarray samples wereused for immunohistochemical staining with human IL-19 mAband anti-CD68 antibody (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA),respectively. The immunostaining of IL-19 was done as previouslydescribed [13]. The paraffin on a series of 5-mm sections was re-moved using xylene. The sections were then rehydrated using agraded ethanol series. The sections were immersed in a 10-mM so-dium citrate solution at 93 \ufffdC for 20 min to retrieve the antigen;next, the sections were washed with tap water. The slides werethen soaked in 90 ml of methanol/10 ml 30% H2O2 for 10\u201315 minat room temperature to block endogenous peroxidases, and thenwashed with PBS. The slides were blocked by immersing them inantibody diluent with background-reducing components (DakoCy-tomation) for 10 min to suppress non-specific immunoglobulinstaining. They were then incubated with purified mAb (diluted1:50) against human IL-19 or anti-CD68 antibody (diluted 1:100)in blocking reagent at 4 \ufffdC overnight. The pre-absorption testwas done before the paraffin tissue sections had been incubatedwith recombinant IL-19 protein and 1BB1 (ratio, 10:1). Incubatingparaffin tissue sections with mouse IgG1 isotype (clone 11711;R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) instead of primary antibody wasthe negative control. The slides were then treated consecutivelywith HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Biolegend, San Diego,CA) (diluted 1:200) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.Next, the slides were incubated using an AEC or DAB substratekit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the color reactionwas allowed to develop for 5\u201310 min. After the staining reaction,the slides were washed thoroughly in tap water, counterstainedwith Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, PA), andmounted with cover slides.2.7. Real-time PCR analysis of the IL-19 transcriptTo amplify the IL-19 transcript, real-time PCR was performedusing the LightCycler-Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I kit(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. The sense primer (50-gct gcg tga cca aga acc tcc tgg-30) andantisense primer (50-tag act ctg gtg gca ttg gt-30) were used inreal-time PCR following the standard protocol. Individual PCRproducts were analyzed using melting-point analysis. b-Actinwas used as an internal control gene to normalize for RNAamounts. Real-time PCR product was analyzed using the compara-tive Ct method according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Inbrief, sample variation was corrected by subtracting b-actin Ctvalues from the Ct values (=DCt) of the IL-19.2.8. Western blot analysisFor Western blot analysis, cells (1 \ufffd 106) were plated in 60-mmdishes and starved for 24 h before stimulation. The cells were thenstimulated with human IL-19 (8 nM) for the indicated time. Wes-tern blot analysis was done using antibody specific for phosphor-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) or a-tubulin(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) following the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions.2.9. Cell proliferation assayOEC-M1 and OC3 cells, two cell lines derived from SCC of theoral cavity [19,20] were cultured in growth medium without fetalcalf serum for 16 h, and then exposed to various concentrations ofIL-19 for 48 h. Cells were then incubated with a 1 mg/ml solutionof 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 h. DMSO (dimethyl sulf-oxide) (Sigma) was added to the culture, and absorbance wasdetermined to be 550 nm. Fetal bovine serum (10%) (Sigma) wasused as the positive control. To demonstrate the specific activityof human IL-19, monoclonal antibody 1BB1 against human IL-19at a concentration of 10:1 (1BB1:IL-19) was added alone or to-gether with human IL-19 into cells, and the proliferation of cellswas monitored.2.10. Data analysisStaining results were read by two pathologists (CLH and SSC)blinded to each other\u2019s scoring. The stained TMA slides were visu-ally scored as strongly stained, moderately stained, weakly stained,and not stained. Both pathologists arrived at similar results. Differ-ences of proliferation between groups of cells were evaluated usingthe Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA test and then Dunn test. Statisticalsignificance was set at P < 0.05. Analysis was performed usingcommercial software (SigmaPlot 9.0; Systat Software Inc., PointRichmond, CA).3. Results3.1. IL-19 was expressed in specific tissue typesIL-19 protein was stained in 15 of 28 healthy tissue types(Table 1). Selected immunohistochemical micrographs from thetissue microarrays immunostained with monoclonal antibodiesraised against human IL-19 are shown in Fig. 1. The major celltypes stained specifically positive for IL-19 were epithelial cells,endothelial cells, and macrophages. Non-specific immunostainingdid not occur when the mouse IgG1 isotype was used as thenegative control or when a pre-absorption test was done inthe immunohistochemical protocol (data not shown). To confirmthe expression of IL-19, RNA was extracted and analyzed usingRT-PCR in nine non-pathological human tissue samples (Fig. 2).IL-19 transcripts were expressed in heart, lung, spleen, and pla-centa tissue; these results were consistent with the immunohis-tochemical staining.3.2. Epithelial and myoepithelial cells were stained positive for IL-19Several types of tissue were stained positive for IL-19 in epithe-lial cells: skin, lung, liver, kidney, prostate, adrenal gland, and uter-ine cervix tissue (Table 1). In skin tissue, IL-19 was strongly stainedin the squamous epithelial cells of the basal epidermis (Fig. 1A) andsweat glands. These IL-19-positive squamous epithelial cells wereaccentuated in the stratum basale of skin tissue. In contrast, IL-19 was not stained in the squamous epithelial cells of esophagustissue (Fig. 1B) and only weakly stained in uterine cervix tissue (Ta-ble 1). In lung tissue, alveolar epithelial cells were stained for IL-19(Fig. 1C). In liver tissue, IL-19 was moderately stained in hepato-cytes (Fig. 1D). In kidney tissue, renal tubular cells were stainedpositive for IL-19 (Fig. 1E). In prostate tissue, glandular epithelialFig. 1. Immunohistochemical staining of IL-19 in selected healthy human tissue types on the TMA. IL-19 was strongly stained in squamous epithelial cells (arrow) in skin (A)but not in esophagus tissue (B). In lung tissue, IL-19 was strongly stained in macrophages (arrow) and epithelial cells (arrowhead) (C). In liver tissue, IL-19 was moderatelystained in hepatocytes (D). In kidney tissue, renal tubular cells (arrow) and capillary endothelial cells (arrowhead) were stained positive for IL-19 (E). In prostate tissue, IL-19was moderately stained in glandular epithelial cells (arrow) and strongly stained in myoepithelial cells (arrowhead) (F). None of the cells in breast (G) or ureter tissue (H)were positively stained for IL-19.224 C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228cells and myoepithelial cells surrounding the prostate glands werestained positive for IL-19 (Fig. 1F). In adrenal gland tissue, glandu-lar epithelial cells were strongly stained for IL-19 (Table 1). Theglandular epithelial cells of breast tissue (Fig. 1G) were not stainedfor IL-19. Most epithelial cells in gastrointestinal and urinary tracttissue were not stained for IL-19 (Table 1 and Fig. 1H).3.3. Endothelial cells were stained positive for IL-19The endothelial cells of small vessels in skin, lung, kidney, heart,and placenta tissue were stained positive for IL-19 (Table 1). In kid-ney tissue, anti-IL-19 antibody highlighted most of the capillaryendothelial cells between the renal tubules (Fig. 1E, arrowhead).Fig. 2. IL-19 transcripts were expressed in non-pathological tissue. Total RNAextracted from non-pathological human tissue and IL-19 transcripts were amplifiedusing RT-PCR. 1: heart, 2: lung, 3: pancreas, 4: spleen, 5: thyroid, 6: skeletal muscle,7: stomach, 8: placenta, 9: ureter. b-Actin was an internal control. Similar resultswere found in tissue samples from three different donors.C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228 2253.4. Macrophages were stained positive for IL-19We found IL-19 protein in macrophages in lung (Fig. 1C), smallintestine, colon, rectum, and spleen tissue (Table 1). To colocalizeIL-19 with CD68 positive cells, we used separate stainings for IL-19 and CD68 from neighboring sections on the same tissue slide.These macrophages were stained positive for CD68 (data notshown).Fig. 3. Different types of tumor cells expressed various patterns of IL-19 in neoplastic ticells (arrows) were strongly stained for IL-19. Tumor cells in infiltrating duct carcinoma (Icells in hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver (D) and renal cell carcinoma of the kidney (Etumor cells (arrow) were not stained for IL-19.3.5. Tumor cells in different neoplastic tissue samples were stainedpositive for IL-19Tumor cells in 13 of 15 neoplastic tissue samples were stainedpositive for IL-19 at various levels (Table 2). In tissue from SCC ofthe tongue (Fig. 3A) and esophagus (Fig. 3B), most tumor cells werestrongly stained for IL-19. Infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) of thebreast tumor cells showed strongly positive immunostaining (Fig.3C). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Fig. 3D), renal cell carcinoma(RCC) (Fig. 3E), and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary tumor cellswere moderately stained for IL-19. Transitional cell carcinoma(TCC) tumor cells of the bladder, thymic carcinoma, and lymphomawere weakly stained for IL-19 (Table 2). However, most adenocar-cinoma (AC) of the stomach and colon (Fig. 3F) tumor cells werenot stained for IL-19. To further determine if immunostaining in-deed reflected IL-19 gene expression in the neoplastic tissues, weperformed real-time PCR analysis on the neoplastic tissues withdifferent levels of immunostaining. SCC of oral cavity and IDC ofbreast (strongly stained), SCC of lung (moderately stained), TCCof bladder (weakly stained), and AC of colon (non-stained) wereanalyzed for IL-19 transcripts (n = 3 in each tumor).

Transcripts of IL-19 and its receptors IL-20R1/IL-20R2 in three tissuesamples of SCC of the oral cavity (case-1, case-2, and case-3) were amplified usingRT-PCR.226 C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228tissues expressed the least levels of IL-19 transcripts than other tu-mor tissues. In comparison with AC of colon tissues, the SCC of oralcavity, IDC of breast, SCC of lung, and TCC of bladder tissues ex-pressed higher levels of IL-19 transcripts (5.2-, 4.7-, 5.0-, and 2.8-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4).3.6. A high percentage of carcinoma cells were stained positive for IL-19Many carcinoma tissue samples in the TMA were positivelystained for IL-19. To determine whether IL-19 was indeed stainedin the whole section of carcinoma tissue, we stained, with anti-IL-19 mAb, archived tissue samples from 34 cases of SCC, 8 casesof RCC, 9 cases of IDC, 9 cases of HCC, and 18 cases of adenocarci-noma. A high percentage of SCC, RCC, IDC, and HCC samples, butnot adenocarcinoma samples, showed strong-to-moderate positiveIL-19 immunostaining (Table 3).3.7. IL-19 activated intracellular signal in oral cancer cell linesMany SCC tissue samples were strongly stained for IL-19. RT-PCR analysis of 3 SCC tumor samples of the oral cavity also showedFig. 4. IL-19 transcripts in neoplastic tissues. Transcripts of IL-19 in SCC of oralcavity, IDC of breast, SCC of lung, TCC of bladder, and AC of colon were determinedusing reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR.

We hypothesized that IL-19may act on tumor cells in an autocrine manner. Thus, we chose oralcancer cell lines as a model to study the effect of IL-19 on oral can-cer cells. OEC-M1 and OC3 cells expressed the mRNA of both IL-19and its receptors IL-20R1/IL-20R2 (data not shown). We treatedOEC-M1 and OC3 cells with IL-19 and analyzed the effect of IL-19 on intracellular signaling. After the cells were treated with IL-19, the intracellular AKT signal was activated (Fig. 6 A and B), whileERK and p38 were not significantly activated (data not shown). TheFig. 6. IL-19 activated intracellular signals in oral cancer cell lines. We analyzed,using Western blotting, the intracellular AKT signal of OEC-M1 (A) and OC3 (B) cellsafter they were treated with IL-19 (8 nM) at the indicated times. (C) IL-19 (4 and8 nM/ml) activated AKT signal in OEC-M1 cells after 30 min treatment, which wasattenuated by anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (1BB1, 20 nM). Similar results wereobtained in three independent experiments.C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228 227phospho-AKT in OEC-M1 cells was activated by IL-19 and attenu-ated by anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6C) which indicatedthat the activity of IL-19 on OEC-M1 cells is specific.3.8. IL-19 induced proliferation of oral cancer cell linesWe next determined the effect of IL-19 on proliferation of oralcancer cell lines. We treated OEC-M1 cells with IL-19 (2, 4, and8 nM) for 48 h and determined the cells proliferation using MTT as-say. IL-19 induced proliferation of OEC-M1 cells (Fig. 7A) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IL-19 (8 nM) also induced prolifer-ation of OC3 cells (Fig. 7B). These proliferation responses wereattenuated by anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 7 A and B).4. DiscussionKnowledge about the influence of IL-19 on tissue is still incom-plete. So far, IL-19 has been found in LPS-treated monocytes, skinkeratinocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells [6,21\u201324]. Furtherexploring the expression and distribution of IL-19 in all tissuesand cell types may help us to investigate the impact of IL-19 inthe pathophysiology of human diseases.In the present study, using a tissue microarray and immunohis-tochemical staining, we presented a survey of the distribution ofFig. 7. IL-19 induced proliferation of oral cancer cell lines. OEC-M1 (A) and OC3 (B)cells were treated with various concentration of IL-19 for 48 h. The proliferation ofOEC-M1 and OC3 cells were determined by MTT assay (*P < 0.05 versus control).Anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (1BB1, 20 nM) was used to specifically neutralizethe proliferative activity of IL-19 (#P < 0.05 versus IL-19 (8 nM)). Fetal bovine serum(FBS) was used as a positive control. Values are means \u00b1 SEM of triplicateexperiments.IL-19 protein in 28 types of healthy human tissue and 15 typesof neoplastic tissue. We found that 15 of 28 types of healthy tissuewere stained positive for IL-19. We also verified the TMA resultswith a semi-quantitative analysis and clarified the IL-19-positive-staining cell types in healthy tissue. The major cell types thatstained positive for IL-19 were epithelial cells, endothelial cells,and macrophages the finding was not previously reported. In addi-tion, we also showed that 13 of 15 malignant tumor cells, espe-cially SCC, RCC, IDC, and HCC, were stained positive for IL-19.We previously reported [25] the tissue distribution of IL-20using TMAs. Both IL-19 and IL-20 were stained in the cell types:epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macro-phages. However, they are expressed in different tissue types. Epi-thelial cells in liver, kidney, and uterine cervix tissue werepositively stained for IL-19 but not for IL-20. In contrast, epithelialcells in breast, fallopian tube, and ureter tissue were positivelystained for IL-20 but not for IL-19. Tissue macrophages stainedfor IL-19 were less widely distributed than those stained for IL-20. Skeletal muscle cells were stained positive for IL-20 [25] butnot for IL-19, which was consistent with the mRNA expression con-firmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 2).IL-19 shares a receptor complex with IL-20, indicating thatsome of the biological activities of these two cytokines might over-lap. For example, both IL-19 and IL-20 were strongly stained in skinepidermis and induced KGF production in CD8+ T cells, which sug-gested that both cytokines might be involved in keratinocyte pro-liferation [13,26] and skin diseases. However, the disparateexpression of these two cytokines in the tissues suggests they alsohave dissimilar biological roles.It is interesting that most of malignant tumors in this studywere positively stained for IL-19. We found that all of SCC of theskin, oral cavity, esophagus, and lung were stained positive forIL-19, but adenocarcinoma tissue from the gastrointestinal tractwas not. Notably, squamous epithelial cells of healthy esophaguswere not stained positive for IL-19, while tumor cells of SCC ofesophagus were strongly stained for IL-19. We also demonstratedthat the intensity of IL-19 immunostaining was correlated withthe transcript level of IL-19 in SCC of oral cavity, IDC of breast,TCC of bladder, and AC of colon. However, tumor cells of SCC oflung were moderately stained for IL-19, while their IL-19 transcriptwas shown to be as high as those of SCC of oral cavity and IDC ofbreast tissues. The discrepancy may be due to the variation be-tween patients or different stages of lung cancer. Further investiga-tion will be required to explore if IL-19 expression level correlateswith progression of lung cancer. In our previous report [13], immu-nostaining of IL-19 on psoriasis tissue showed upregulation of IL-19 in psoriasis patients. IL-19 may upregulate KGF productionand be involved in modulating keratinocyte proliferation and thepathogenesis of psoriasis [13]. In this study, IL-19 was stronglystained in SCC of buccal mucosa, tongue, and esophagus with thestaining intensity similar to that of psoriasis (data not shown).Moreover, IL-19 induced intracellular AKT phosphorylation andcell proliferation in oral cancer cell lines. Thus, IL-19 might playan important role in the pathogenesis of SCC.We also found that healthy breast tissue was not positivelystained for IL-19, but breast IDC tissue was strongly stained forIL-19. This finding is compatible with a previous report [27] ofabundant IL-19 mRNA expression in breast-cancer cell lines. Thus,the detailed mechanism how IL-19 is involved in the malignanttransformation of epithelial cells requires further investigation.Among immune cells, monocytes are the major source of IL-19[21]. One study [20] reported that neither resting nor stimulated Tcell or natural killer (NK) cells expressed IL-19, and another study[21] reported that healthy and Epstein Barr virus-transformed hu-man B cells expressed IL-19 only in small amounts. In the presentstudy, we found that B cell lymphoma was stained positive for228 C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228IL-19, suggesting that IL-19 may be involved in B cell-lineageneoplasm.We recently [10] confirmed that IL-19 induced apoptosis andchemoattractant production in a lung carcinoma cell line, andthat it also induced neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, which indi-cated that IL-19 is a chemoattractive factor. The present studyshowed IL-19 activated intracellular AKT, a signal relating to tu-mor cell proliferation, in oral cancer cell lines, which indicatedthat IL-19 might act in an autocrine manner and be involvedin tumor growth. We also showed that IL-19 induced prolifera-tion of oral cancer cell lines. We therefore hypothesize that IL-19 is involved in tumor biology. It will be worthwhile to furtherexplore its molecular mechanism.Myoepithelial cells in prostate gland tissue stained positive forIL-19 is a distinctive finding. IL-19 may be useful as a myoepithelialmarker. It also points to a potential clinical use for IL-19 in theevaluation of prostate biopsies: the presence or absence of myoep-ithelial cells may be one of the key elements in distinguishing be-nign from malignant glands. Markers such as cytokeratin 34 b-E12and p63 are currently used to highlight myoepithelial cells in theprostate [28]. It may be worthwhile to examine whether IL-19 addsadditional value to the test.In summary, this is the first study to use a tissue microarray andimmunohistochemical staining to investigate the distribution, bytissue type and specific cell type, of IL-19 expression. Epithelialcells, endothelial cells, and macrophages were the major cell typesstained positive for IL-19. We also found several types of tumorcells that were positively stained for IL-19, especially SCC cells,which were widely distributed in several types of tumor tissue.We also showed that IL-19 acted on SCC in an autocrine manner.Our data will provide valuable references for further investigationof the biological functions and clinical implications of IL-19 inhumans.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Mr. Tun-Yi Mou, Department of Physics, NationalCheng Kung University, for building our arrayer.
