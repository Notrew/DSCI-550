A recent studyof coexisting melanoma and RCC in the same patients supports agenetic predisposition underlying the association between thesetwo cancers3. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor(MITF) has been proposed to act as a melanoma oncogene4; it alsostimulates the transcription of hypoxia inducible factor5 (HIF1A),the pathway of which is targeted by kidney cancer susceptibilitygenes6. We therefore proposed that MITF might have a role inconferring a genetic predisposition to co-occurring melanomaand RCC. Here we identify a germline missense substitution inMITF (Mi-E318K) that occurred at a significantly higher frequencyin genetically enriched patients affected with melanoma, RCC orboth cancers, when compared with controls. Overall, Mi-E318Kcarriers had a higher than fivefold increased risk of developingmelanoma, RCC or both cancers. Codon 318 is located in asmall-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus site (YKXE)and Mi-E318K severely impaired SUMOylation of MITF. Mi-E318K enhanced MITF protein binding to the HIF1A promoterand increased its transcriptional activity compared to wild-typeMITF. Further, we observed a global increase in Mi-E318K-occupied loci. In an RCC cell line, gene expression profilingidentified a Mi-E318K signature related to cell growth, prolifera-tion and inflammation. Lastly, the mutant protein enhancedmelanocytic and renal cell clonogenicity, migration and invasion,consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Our dataprovide insights into the link between SUMOylation, transcriptionand cancer.MITF encodes a member of the Myc supergene family of basichelix\u2013loop\u2013helix zipper transcription factors. It has a complexintron\u2013exon structure, yielding protein products with different aminotermini7. The M-isoform (expressed in the melanocyte lineage) ofMITF regulates expression of a large set of genes promoting prolifera-tion and invasion. For instance, it controls the expression of MET5 andCDKN2A/p16INK4A5, which have key roles in melanoma develop-ment. The role of the A-isoform of MITF (expressed in kidney) inrenal cell transformation has yet to be elucidated. However, MITFbelongs to the same family of transcription factors (the MiT family)as the TFEC, TFE3 and TFEB genes; the two latter were identified astargets of somatic recurrent translocations in a RCC subtype foundpredominantly in children and young adults8.We sequenced the MITF gene in 62 patients with melanoma andRCC. Five patients exhibited a germline heterozygous missense sub-stitution, p.E318K (c.952G.A, in MITF isoform 4, NCBI accessionNM_000248.3) (Fig. 1a). The frequency of this variant was signifi-cantly higher in patients with both melanoma and RCC (melanoma1 RCC) than in 1,659 population-based cancer-free controls(P 5 1.3 3 1024). Carriers of the p.E318K variant (Mi-E318K) exhibiteda 14-fold higher risk than controls for developing melanoma 1 RCC(Table 1). To investigate the effect of Mi-E318K on susceptibilityto melanoma alone, we genotyped 603 affected patients that had under-gone oncogenetic testing for melanoma susceptibility genes1 andwere negative for CDKN2A and CDK4 mutations (Table 1).

The carriers of Mi-E318K in this group exhibited.4-fold higher melanoma risk than controls (Table 1). In addition, Mi-E318K co-segregated with melanoma in three melanoma-prone familiesthat had DNA available in relatives of index cases carrying Mi-E318K(SupplementaryFig.1a).WealsofoundthatMi-E318Kwasmorestronglyassociated with multiple occurrences of primary melanomas than withsingle occurrence, irrespective of family history (P 5 0.02, SupplementaryTable 1). To investigate the effect of Mi-E318K in RCC susceptibility, wegenotyped 164 patients with RCC referred to oncogenetic clinics, whowereenrichedforrarehistological subtypesandwhowerewild type for theknown RCC-predisposing genes6. These patients also exhibited a higherfrequency of Mi-E318K than controls (P 5 0.008) (Table 1). After cor-recting for multiple testing, the association between Mi-E318K and mel-anoma 1 RCC, melanoma only or RCC only remained significant,although marginally so for the RCC-only group (P 5 0.02). The threegroups showed similar Mi-E318K allele frequencies (P 5 0.10). Whenall 829 patients with melanoma and/or RCC were pooled, Mi-E318Kfrequency was significantly different from controls (P 5 1.2 3 1026).The pooled group of Mi-E318K carriers had a greater than fivefold riskof developing melanoma, RCC or both cancers, as compared to controls(Table 1). The clinical and pathological features of the 27 Mi-E318Kcarriers are described in Supplementary Table 2. Principal componentanalysis (PCA) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data across thegenome in more than 75% of cases and controls showed appropriateclustering of cases and controls after exclusion of a few subjects ofnon-European ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Association analysisof melanoma and/or RCC with Mi-E318K provided similar results whenperformed with or without adjusting for principal components(Supplementary Table 3). To assess whether Mi-E318K predisposed tothe coexistence of melanoma and a second primary neoplasm other thanRCC, we gathered data from European countries, but these data wereinsufficient for separate analyses of each type of cancer. Overall, we con-cluded from our findings that Mi-E318K is a rare substitution that confersan increased risk for developing melanoma and/or RCC. However, giventhe selection of patients who were part of case series undergoing genetictesting, further investigation of Mi-E318K in large series of unselectedsporadic renal cancer and melanoma cases is merited.Previous studies have shown that MITF is expressed in a majority ofmelanomas and in a subset of kidney tumours9. Accordingly, ourimmunohistochemical analyses showed that MITF was expressed inboth melanomas from patients carrying the germline mutation Mi-E318K (n 5 8) and in melanomas from wild-type patients (n 5 8)(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In addition, two out of seven RCCs fromMi-E318K carriers were positive for MITF (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d),suggesting that Mi-E318K might have a role in renal transformation.None of the six wild-type MITF RCC samples analysed in this studyshowed MITF labelling.Mi-E318K occurs at a conserved position in MITF within a consensusmotif (IKQE) that matches perfectly with the consensus sequenceYKXE for covalent binding of SUMO10 (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).Because SUMOylation is critically dependent on the acidic residue at12 (E) of the acceptor lysine (K), we tested whether Mi-E318K affectsMITF SUMOylation. Co-expression of histidine-tagged (His)\u2013SUMO1with wild-type MITF and western blot analysis revealed a 120-kDa bandand a doublet above 95 kDa, in addition to the 55\u201365 kDa native doublet(Fig. 1b). The p.K182R mutation introduced within the second MITFSUMOylation site led to complete disappearance of the 120-kDa MITFform, but had little effect on the 95-kDa doublet. When glutamic acidresidue 318 was replaced by a lysine, mimicking the germline mutation,we observed a strong decrease in the levels of all the SUMO-modified forms of MITF. Lastly, no SUMOylated forms were seen withthe double-mutant [p.K182R;p.E318K]. Similar observations weremade with co-expression of haemagglutinin-tagged (HA)\u2013SUMO2(Supplementary Fig. 4a), demonstrating that Mi-E318K affected bothSUMO1 and SUMO2 modifications. Western blot analysis with anti-MITF antibody, after affinity purification of His\u2013SUMO1-containingproteins on Ni-NTA columns, confirmed that the high molecularweight bands were indeed SUMO-modified MITF proteins and thatMi-E318K markedly reduced all the MITF SUMOylated forms(Fig. 1c). Altogether, these results demonstrated that codon 316 wasthe major SUMO acceptor site in MITF and that Mi-E318K severelyimpaired SUMO conjugation to MITF.SUMOylation has been shown to orchestrate a variety of cellularprocesses, in part through the control of nucleo-cytoplasmic signaltransduction.

Indeed, on a synthetic reporter gene com-prising three E-boxes, Mi-E318K showed two- to threefold greatertranscriptional activity than that of wild type (Fig. 2a). The doubleMITF mutant, [p.E318K;p.K182R], was more effective than Mi-E318K, and the single p.K182R mutant exhibited activity comparableto that of wild type. We next tested whether Mi-E318K affected MITFactivity on physiological target promoters, such as MET and HIF1A,two MITF-regulated genes involved in cell survival and in melanocyteand kidney tumorigenesis. We also tested CDKN2A and TYR promoters,which are involved in melanocyte proliferation and differentiationprocesses, respectively. Wild type and mutant Mi-E318K showedsimilar activity on the MET (Fig. 2b), TYR and CDKN2A promoters(Supplementary Fig. 5), but Mi-E318K more efficiently activated theHIF1A promoter than wild type (Fig. 2c). This observation suggeststhat Mi-E318K alters MITF transcriptional activity on a subset of itstarget genes. To determine the global transcriptional effects of Mi-E318K, we performed pan-genomic expression profiling of A375 mel-anoma and RCC4 cells infected with adenoviruses that encoded eitherwild-type MITF or Mi-E318K (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b, c, d). Analysisof the genes regulated differentially by wild type and Mi-E318K inA375 cells failed to identify a specific Mi-E318K signature. However,in RCC4 cells, we identified a Mi-E318K signature composed of 32genes (Supplementary Table 4). On the basis of the bioinformaticanalysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software, these geneswere associated with cell growth, proliferation and inflammation(Supplementary Fig. 7). Among the genes downregulated by Mi-E318K compared to wild type, IRAK2 (ref. 11), EGR1 (ref. 12) andIL6 (ref. 13) have tumour suppressor functions. The upregulated genesincluded CCR7, a HIF-1a target gene14 and activator of the NFkBpathway15; ABCB5, one of the most well-documented markers formelanoma initiating cells16; GADD45G, a member of the GADD45family of stress sensors, which connects NFkB to the MAP kinasepathway17; and TRIM63, which was one of the top five upregulatedgenes and was the major gene found to be differentially expressed inpatients with TFE3/TFEB translocation RCC as compared to othersubtypes of RCC8. These experiments confirmed the different tran-scriptional potentials of wild type and Mi-E318K, particularly on genesinvolved in proliferation and inflammation.To investigate whether SUMOylation influenced genome-wideMITF occupancy of its target sites, we performed chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)experiments in 501mel human melanoma cell lines expressing wildtype or Mi-E318K. Data analysis shows that 22,157 sites are occupiedby Mi-E318K, whereas only 9,107 were detected for wild type, thedifference being the presence of a large number of weakly occupiedsites in the Mi-E318K data set. Comparative analysis of the ChIP-seqdata sets using read density matrix clustering identified sites that areoccupied by both wild type and Mi-E318K (Fig. 2d, sets B and E),whereas some promoter sites are uniquely or preferentially occupiedby Mi-E318K (Fig. 2d, sets A and D; Supplementary Table 5). Forexample, a higher occupancy of the HIF1A promoter by Mi-E318Kcompared to wild type is observed (Fig. 2e). Mi-E318K also showedincreased binding to the ABCB5 locus (Fig. 2e), the expression ofwhich is increased in RCC4-expressing Mi-E318K. Of note, Mi-E318K binds more efficiently than wild type to the HMOX1 promoter(Supplementary Table 5), a gene involved in both kidney cancer18 andmelanoma cell growth19. Although the HIF1A promoter was betteroccupied and activated (in a gene promoter assay) by Mi-E318Kthan by wild type, we observed equal amounts of HIF1A messengerRNA in Mi-E318K- or wild-type-infected A375 and RCC4 cells.HIF1A transcripts are subjected to post-transcriptional regulation thatcontrols their stability20; this may mask the transcriptional effect of Mi-E318K. Alternatively, the cellular context or the chromatin landscapein RCC4 or A375 cells may not permit increased transcription. Indeed,this was observed for MITF target genes such as TYR, TYRP1 and DCT,which were not upregulated by MITF overexpression in A375 cells.Taken together, our data indicate that the naturally occurring Mi-E318K severely impaired MITF SUMOylation and showed higherglobal transcriptional activity, in agreement with the currently acceptedmodel of SUMO-mediated transcriptional repression21. The globalincrease in Mi-E318K-occupied loci coupled with the existence of sitesexclusively bound by the mutant protein indicate that SUMOylationregulates the repertoire of MITF target genes. SUMOylation-deficientMi-E318K protein may therefore result in the regulation of distinct setsof genes, hence leading to gain-of-function properties.To evaluate the tumorigenic potential of Mi-E318K, we tested itseffect on migration, invasion and colony formation of stable melanomacells (501mel) expressing wild-type MITF or Mi-E318K (Fig. 3a). Weobserved increased migration (Fig. 3b) and invasion (Fig. 3c) in twodifferent Mi-E318K clones compared to wild-type clones. Similarresults were obtained in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells (Fig. 3d, e) infectedwith adenoviruses encoding wild type or Mi-E318K. In contrast, Mi-E318K caused barely significant effects in A375 cells (used also forexpression profiling) (Supplementary Fig. 8).

All rights reserved\u00a92011Mi-E318K was enhanced compared to wild-type-transfected or controlcells. Overall, these data indicated that Mi-E318K was more potent thanwild type for promoting invasive and tumorigenic behaviours in mel-anoma and RCC cells. However, Mi-E318K did not significantly stimu-late melanoma or RCC cell growth (data not shown). These features arereminiscent of melanoma cell populations with increased invasive anddivision potential but with a slow growth rate, which are considered tobe melanoma-initiating cells22. Thus, Mi-E318K might favour a pheno-typic switch of melanoma cells towards a tumour-initiating cell pheno-type, possibly in synergy with hypoxia23.Indeed, both the epidermis (where melanocytes are located) and theinner renal medulla are physiologically hypoxic tissues24,25. Hypoxia iscapable of rapidly inducing HIF1A to initiate a cell-survival response26.Of note, several genes identified by expression profiling or ChIP-seq(HIF1A, CCR7, HMOX1) function in the hypoxia pathway. Both ultra-violet exposure and hypoxia generate radical oxygen species (ROS). Inturn, oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways that can lead tocellular transformation, proliferation and stem cell survival, amongother features27. Our IPA analysis associated the Mi-E318K signaturewith inflammation, cell proliferation and cancer. Various environ-mental stresses, including hypoxia and ROS, were previously shownto induce global protein SUMOylation28. In this context, Mi-E318K,which prevents MITF SUMOylation, could impair the adaptation ofcells to stress and initiate tumour formation. Our study has wide impli-cations for understanding the role of MITF and its SUMOylation in thephysiology and tumorigenesis of melanocytes and kidney cells.We have identified a rare oncogenic germline substitution, Mi-E318K, that predisposes to both melanoma and RCC. Interestingly,MITF loss-of-function mutations are responsible for an inherited dis-order in neural crest cell development, the type 2a Waardenburg syn-drome7. This is reminiscent of the RET oncogene, in which activatinggermline mutations predispose to medullary thyroid carcinoma, butloss-of-function germline mutations predispose to Hirschsprung\u2019s dis-ease, a congenital absence of enteric neurons in the gastrointestinaltract29. Our data indicate that mutation screening in geneticallyenriched patients is a powerful strategy to identify rare genetic vari-ation that confers a moderate risk of cancer30. Lastly, it highlights therelevance of hereditary tumour models for shedding light on cell-growth-related signals and identifying cancer driver genes.METHODS SUMMARYParticipants were included with the approval of an institutional review board.Sanger sequencing of MITF isoforms was performed in 62 melanoma 1 RCCcases. Mutations numbering referred to NCBI accession NM_000248.3. Wild-typeor Mi-E318K genotyping was performed in 1,659 controls and 829 cases byTaqMan; positive samples were checked by Sanger sequencing. Genome-wideSNP data were genotyped by the Centre National de Ge\u0301notypage (CNG, CEA)using Illumina technology. PCA was applied to the SNP data using EIGENSTRATsoftware. Immunohistochemistry was performed on melanoma and kidney fixedsamples with anti-MITF antibody (Abcam, clone D5). Mutations in the twoSUMO1 fixation sites, p.K182R and p.E318K, were generated with theQuickChange method in wild-type MITF-M and MITF-A isoforms and verifiedby sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293, 501mel, Melan-a andRCC4 cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Western blottingand immunofluorescence were performed with antibodies to MITF (Abcam, cloneC5), HA-tag, SUMO1 or ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reporter assays wereperformed by transient transfection in triplicate with lipofectamine (Invitrogen),and pCMVbGal was included to control transfection efficiency. Gene expressionmicroarray assays were performed with Agilent technology by the Institut deCance\u0301rologie Gustave Roussy (IGR) genomics platform. ChIP-seq experimentswere performed by the Institut de Ge\u0301ne\u0301tique et de Biologie Mole\u0301culaire etCellulaire (IGBMC) microarray and sequencing platforms. Colony forming assayswere performed after 14 days of culture; cells were fixed, stained with 0.4% crystalviolet, and photographed. Statistical analyses for comparison of allele frequenciesbetween cases and controls were performed with Fisher\u2019s exact test. All computa-tions were performed with Stata software, version 11. For functional assays, stat-istical significance was evaluated with the Student\u2019s t-test. Results were consideredsignificant when the Student\u2019s t-test, *P value # 0.05, **P # 0.01, ***P # 0.001.Full Methods and any associated references are available in the online version ofthe paper at www.nature.com/nature.Received 1 February; accepted 2 September 2011.Published online 19 October 2011.1.

Patients with melanoma and RCC. Sixty-two patients thathad developed both melanoma and RCC were included in the MELARISK col-lection at the Institut de Cance\u0301rologie Gustave Roussy (IGR) and other Frenchhospitals, 71% were males. None of these patients carried a germline CDKN2A,CDK4 or VHL pathogenic mutation.Patients with melanoma only. The patients with melanoma were enrolledthrough a nationwide network of French dermatology and oncogenetic clinics thatconstituted the Familial Melanoma Project and the MELARISK collection. Thepresent study investigated a total of 371 index cases from independent pedigreeswith a family history of melanoma (at least two melanoma cases) and/or pancreaticcancer, and 232 sporadic cases diagnosed with multiple primary malignant mel-anomas. A subset of the families (N 5 34) included a melanoma patient andrelatives with pancreatic cancer. These were part of the CDKN2A mutation testingprocedure; carriers of the CDKN2A mutation have high risk of developing pan-creatic cancer31. All cases had confirmed diagnoses of malignant melanomathrough medical records, review of pathological material, and/or pathologicalreports. For all these patients, mutation screening for CDKN2A (exon 1b, 1a, 2and 3) and CDK4 (exon 2) had been undertaken for molecular diagnosis purposes.None of these patients carried a known CDKN2A or CDK4 pathogenic mutation.Patients with RCC only. Overall, 164 patients included in this study haddeveloped RCC only. Those patients had been recruited through French urologyand oncogenetic clinics, within the French National Cancer Institute\u2019s \u2018InheritedPredisposition to Kidney Cancer\u2019 network. They were considered \u2018geneticallyenriched\u2019 based on the following criteria: familial aggregation, young age of onsetand rare histological subtypes. Out of the total of 164 patients, 79 had sporadicccRCC, 54 had papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC; with 6 type I PRCC, 19 typeII PRCC, 1 mixed type PRCC and 28 unknown histological subtypes of PRCC), 1had a mixed RCC phenotypes (that is, papillary and ccRCC), 5 had juvenile RCCand 25 had RCC of unknown histological subtype. None of the 79 patients withccRCC carried a VHL pathogenic germline mutation; none of the 19 patients withPRCCII carried a FH germline mutation; and none of the 6 patients with PRCCIcarried a MET germline mutation.Control subjects. Controls were supplemented by a population-based sample of1,659 French subjects that had participated in the Supplementation in Vitaminsand Mineral Antioxidants (SU.VI.MAX) study32. We confirmed that these sub-jects had not developed any cancer at the time of the present study.The study was approved by an institutional review board (CCPPRB no. 01-09-05, Paris Necker) for the MELARISK collection and by the Ethical Committee ofLe Kremlin-Bice\u0302tre University Hospital, for the kidney cancer collection. It wasconducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. All participatingsubjects signed informed consent and provided blood samples. After informedconsent had been obtained from the subjects, DNA was extracted from peripheralblood lymphocytes with the QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit (QIAGEN), accordingto manufacturer guidelines.MITF gene sequencing. Sanger sequencing of MITF coding sequence, the intron\u2013exon boundaries and the 8 alternative promoters was performed in DNA extractedfrom the blood of 62 patients affected with melanoma 1 RCC (primers availableupon request) on a 3730 DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems; ABI). Nucleotidenumber refers to the wild-type cDNA sequence of MITF (NM_000248.3) asreported in GenBank.Genotyping of Mi-E318K. Genotyping was carried out with Taqman accordingto the manufacturer recommendations. Primers and probes were supplied in theAssay-by-Design by Applied Biosystems (ABI). PCR reactions were performedwith 10 ng genomic DNA and 0.2mmol l21 TaqMan MGB probes. Probe 59-VIC-ATCAAGCAAGAACCCG-39 was designed to match the wild-type allele, andprobe 59-6-FAM-CAAGCAAAAACCCG-39 was designed to match the mutantallele (underlined bold indicates the nucleotide at the mutation site). PCR thermo-cycling was performed on ABI thermocyclers, as follows: 95 uC for 15 min; 30cycles of 95 uC for 15 s and 60 uC for 1 min. Assays were carried out in 96-wellplates that included a negative control (with no DNA) and positive controls (DNAfrom subjects with Mi-E318K). Plates were read on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCRSystem (ABI) with Sequence Detection Software (ABI). Carriers of Mi-E318Kwere confirmed by Sanger sequencing with the above protocol and primers forMITF exon 9.PCA of genome-wide SNP data. To verify that the association of Mi-E318K withmelanoma and/or RCC was not influenced by population stratification, we carriedout PCA of SNP data across the genome in cases and controls that had beengenome-wide genotyped and satisfied stringent quality control criteria. A totalof 1,628 controls and 569 cases affected with melanoma, RCC or both cancers weregenotyped by the Centre National de Ge\u0301notypage (CNG) using IlluminaHumanHap300 Beadchip version 2 duo array for controls and IlluminaHumancnv370k and Human660W-Quad arrays for cases. Samples were excludedfor any of the following reasons: (1) a call rate of less than 97% of the total numberof SNPs on the chip (222 samples); (2) sex as ascertained by genotyping notmatching reported sex (10 samples); (3) heterozygosity on autosomes departingfrom the estimated expected value (7 samples); (4) relatedness with another sam-ple (4 samples). This resulted in exclusion of 243 samples. PCA was then applied to1,954 subjects that passed quality control using EIGENSTRAT software33. Toidentify individuals of non-European ethnicity, SNPs were thinned to reducelinkage disequilibrium and combined with the HapMap data of wide-rangingethnicity. The first two principal components (PCs) clearly separated theHapMap data into distinct clusters according to ethnicity and identified 29 studysamples of non-European ancestry who were excluded. The remaining 1,925European ethnicity samples (1,389 controls, 536 cases) were analysed similarlywithout the Hapmap data. Plotting the first two principal components showedappropriate clustering of cases and controls (Supplementary Fig. 1).MITF immunohistochemistry. Briefly, 4-mm tissue sections were cut from par-affin-embedded blocks, deparaffinized and rehydrated. RCC (patient ID numbers10276, 24976, 11473, 21309, 21939, 25220, 26534; all in Supplementary Table 2)immunohistochemistry was performed with a three-step, avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidasemethod. Staining was performed in an automated Dako Autostainer. Heat-mediatedantigen retrieval was performed in 0.1 mol l21 pH 6.0 citrate, and samples wereheated in a water bath for 30 min in a Dakolink processor (Dako). Monoclonalmouse anti-human MITF (Clone D5, Dako, 1/100) was incubated with the samplesfor 30 min at room temperature (22 uC). SSM immunohistochemistry (patient IDnumbers 19525, 24976, 10254, 15168, 15012, 21000, 22112, 27708 all inSupplementary Table 2 except number 27708 in Supplementary Fig. 1) was per-formed with a three-step avidin\u2013biotin\u2013alkaline-phosphatase method. Staining wasperformed in a Roche Diagnostics Benchmark XT automated stainer. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed in the automat in cell conditioning solu-tion 1 (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h (Dako). Monoclonal mouse anti-Human MITF(Clone D5, Roche Diagnostics, pre-diluted) was incubated with samples for 16 minat room temperature. All slides were then counterstained with haematoxylin.Appropriate negative and positive controls were prepared in parallel.Functional assays. Plasmids. The pcDNA3-Mi construct, which carried theM-MITF isoform and the 3M vector have been described previously34. TheA-MITF isoform was a gift from H. Arnheiter (NIH). The MITF mutations,p.K182R and/or Mi-E318K, were generated with the QuickChange method(Stratagene) with the following sense primers and their reverse complements:Mi-K182R 59-CTTCCCAACATAAGAAGGGAGCTCACAGC-39; MI-E318K59-GGATCATCAAGCAAAAACCAGTTCTTGAG-39. Mutations were con-firmed by DNA sequencing. His\u2013SUMO1 and HA\u2013SUMO2 were a gift from A.Dejean and have been described elsewhere35.Cell cultures, transfections, and immunoblots. Human 501mel and A375 mel-anoma cells, human RCC4 cells and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supple-mented with 7% FBS. Melan-a cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 7% FCS, 200 nMTPA and 200 pM cholera toxin. All the cells were maintained at 37 uC in a humidi-fied atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes(104 cells per well) and transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids (2mg oftotal DNA per well) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hourslater, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed at 95 uC in 13 loading buffer(41.6 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 1.5% SDS, 6.7% glycerol). Proteins were resolved by elec-trophoresis in 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF mem-branes. Proteins were detected with ECL (Amersham) and antibodies to MITF(Abcam), HA-tag (Abcam), SUMO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or ERK2 (SantaCruz Biotechnology).Reporter assays. Human 501mel melanoma cells and HEK293 cells were seededin 24-well dishes (25 3 103 cells per well). Subsequently, cells were transientlytransfected with 0.3mg reporter plasmid (3M, pHIF1A, pMET), 0.05mg ofMITF-encoding plasmids or empty, control pcDNA3 (EV), 2ml of lipofectaminereagent (Invitrogen) and 0.05mg of pCMVbGal for controlling the variability intransfection efficiency. Cells were lysed 48 h later and assayed for luciferase andb-galactosidase activities. Transfections were repeated at least three times.Immunofluorescence. HEK293 cells were seeded on glass coverslips (100 3 103cells) in 6-well dishes, and transfected with 3mg of the different MITF mutants and10ml lipofectamine. Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed for 10 min with 4%paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% Triton X-100/1% bovineserum albumin (BSA), and treated for 2 min with NH4Cl 50 mM . Then, sampleswere washed three times in PBS and stained for 1 h with monoclonal anti-MITFantibody (Abcam, clone D5) in 1% BSA/PBS. Next, samples were washed threetimes in PBS for 5 min each and then stained secondarily for 1 h with Alexa-594-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Molecular probes) in 1% BSA. Cells werecounterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), mounted withFluoromount-G (Southern Biotech), and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot micro-scope equipped with epifluorescent illumination.LETTER RESEARCHMacmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved\u00a92011Colony forming assay. Immortalized Melan-a mouse melanocytes, A375human melanoma cells and RCC4 human cells (8 3 104 cells per well) weretransfected with wild type or Mi-E318K (3mg total DNA per well and 10%pBABE-puro) with the FuGENE 6 Transfection reagent (Roche AppliedScience). Puromycin (1mg ml21) was added to media at 48 h post-transfection.Fourteen days later, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.4% crystal violet, andthe plates were photographed.Establishing stable 501mel cells that expressed tagged MITF. 501mel cells weretransfected with FuGENE 6 reagent, a vector encoding puromycin resistance, anda pCMV vector that was either an empty, control vector or a vector encoding33HA-tagged MITF (wild type or Mi-E318K). Transfected cells were selectedwith puromycin; the expression of MITF was verified by western blot analysiswith anti-MITF (Abcam, C5) or anti-HA (Roche, 12CA5) antibodies.Migration and invasion assays. Migration (on uncoated filters) and invasion (oncoated filters with matrigel) were investigated in a Boyden chamber system thatcomprised 24-well plates and 8-mm pore filter inserts (BD Bioscience). Stable501mel melanoma cells (2 3 105 cells), A375 melanoma cells (1.5 3 105 cells)and RCC4 renal cancer cells (5 3 104 cells) were infected with control vector oradenovirus that encoded wild type or Mi-E318K at a multiplicity of infection(MOI) of 20 for 24 h, were then resuspended in serum-free DMEM and seededon the upper chamber inserts. DMEM with 7% FCS was placed into the lowerchamber. Twenty-four hours (501mel and RCC4) or 6 h (A375 cells) later, cellsadherent to the underside of the filters were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with0.4% crystal violet. Adherent cells were counted in five random fields at 3200magnification. Results represented the average of duplicate samples from threeindependent experiments.Gene expression arrays. Three replicates were performed for both RCC4 andA375 cells. mRNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) from A375 melanomacells and from RCC4 cells infected with either control, wild type or Mi-E318K,according to standard procedures. Briefly, probes were synthesized from 500 ng oftotal RNA in two steps, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The twosamples to be compared were labelled separately with different fluorescent dyes,cyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5). For each sample, 1mg of purified cRNAlabelled in cy5 was mixed with the same amount of cRNA labelled in cy3. Labelincorporation was checked on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Hybridizationswere performed with a dye-swap strategy on whole-human-genome dual colour8 3 60K oligonucleotide microarrays (design 028004; Agilent Technologies).Feature extraction software provided by Agilent (version 10.7.3.1) was used toquantify the intensity of fluorescent images and to apply a linear/lowess normal-ization to correct for artefacts caused by nonlinear rates of dye incorporation andinconsistent relative fluorescence intensities between some green and red dyes. Alldata were imported into Resolver software (Rosetta Biosoftware) for databasemanagement, quality control, computational re-combination of dye-swaps and statistical analysis. Mi-E318K specific signaturewas generated using the following parameters: intensity .50; fold change .1.5; Pvalue ,0.05. Functional analysis was carried out with the Ingenuity PathwayAnalysis (Ingenuity System, http://www.ingenuity.com).ChIP-seq. ChIP-seq was performed as previously described36. Briefly, chro-matin was prepared from native 501mel cells or cells that stably expressedHA-tagged wild type or Mi-E318K. The isolated chromatin was HA-immu-noprecipitated and sequenced with an Illumina GAIIx sequencer. The rawdata were analysed with the Illumina Eland pipeline V1.6 programme.Peak detection was performed with MACS software (http://liulab.dfci.har-vard.edu/MACS/), and the peaks were annotated with GPAT software (http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/GPAT/Gpat_home.html). Peak annotations were performedwith a window that included 620 kb from the coordinates at the beginning andend of RefSeq transcripts. The total number of reads for the wild-type data set was1.7 fold higher than for the Mi-E318K data set. To facilitate quantitative compar-isons, an appropriate number of reads was randomly removed from the wild-typedata set to match the number present in the Mi-E318K data set. Subsequently,a quantitative comparison of the ChIP-seq data sets was performed withseqMINER37. Clustering was performed by counting the number of tags in a 36-bp sliding window for each ChIP-seq data set based on the coordinates of wild-typeor Mi-E318K binding sites or on a reference sequence (RefSeq TSS). Only peakswith $10 reads were used for comparison. A matrix of binding sites and densitieswas generated and subjected to K-means clustering with the seqMINER pro-gramme.Statistical analysis. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare Mi-E318K allelefrequencies between cases and controls and among different groups of cases.The odds ratios and confidence intervals associated with Mi-E318K carrier statuswere estimated by exact logistic regression. Logistic regression was also used to testfor the effect of Mi-E318K on melanoma and/or RCC with and without adjustingfor the first ten principal components estimated from genome-wide SNP data inpatients and controls who were genome-wide genotyped and passed quality con-trol. All computations were performed with Stata software, version 11 (StataCorpLP). For functional assays, results were considered significant when the Student\u2019st-test, *P value was #0.05, **P # 0.01, ***P # 0.001.31. Goldstein, A. M. et al.
