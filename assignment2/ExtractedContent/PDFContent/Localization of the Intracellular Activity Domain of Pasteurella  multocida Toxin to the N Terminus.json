VALLANCE,AND MENGFEI HODepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State UniversitySchool of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435Received 12 May 1998/Returned for modification 29 July 1998/Accepted 19 October 1998We have shown that Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) directly causes transient activation of Gqa proteinthat is coupled to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cb1 in Xenopus oocytes (B. A. Wilson, X. Zhu,M. Ho, and L. Lu, J. Biol. Chem. 272:1268\u20131275, 1997). We found that antibodies directed against anN-terminal peptide of PMT inhibited the toxin-induced response in Xenopus oocytes, but antibodies against aC-terminal peptide did not. To test whether the intracellular activity domain of PMT is localized to the Nterminus, we conducted a deletion mutational analysis of the PMT protein, using the Xenopus oocyte system asa means of screening for toxin activity. Using PCR and conventional cloning techniques, we cloned from atoxinogenic strain of P. multocida the entire toxA gene, encoding the 1,285-amino-acid PMT protein, andexpressed the recombinant toxin as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli. We subsequently generateda series of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants and expressed the His-tagged PMT fragments in E. coli.These proteins were screened for cytotoxic activity on cultured Vero cells and for intracellular activity in theXenopus oocyte system. Only the full-length protein without the His tag exhibited activity on Vero cells. Thefull-length PMT and N-terminal fragments containing the first 500 residues elicited responses in oocytes, butthe C-terminal 780 amino acid fragment did not. Our results confirm that the intracellular activity domain ofPMT is localized to the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the protein and that the C terminus is required for entryinto cells.Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a major virulence factorassociated with progressive atrophic rhinitis in domestic andwild animals (1, 12), respiratory disease in cattle and labora-tory rabbits (3\u20136, 8, 14), and dermonecrosis and bacteremiaresulting from bite wounds or animal exposure in humans (15,16, 20, 23, 28, 35, 41). PMT is a 1,285-amino-acid protein (7,22, 26, 32) that appears to bind to and enter mammalian cellsvia receptor-mediated endocytosis (34, 36) and acts intracellu-larly to initiate DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal rearrange-ments (9, 17, 18, 21, 24, 29, 36). Some of the intracellularevents that have been observed upon exposure to PMT incultured fibroblasts and osteoblasts include enhanced hydroly-sis of inositolphospholipids to increase intracellular inositolphosphates and diacylglycerol (29, 30, 38); mobilization ofintracellular Ca21 pools (29, 30, 38, 40); decreased ADP-ribo-sylation of GRP78/BiP (39); increased protein phosphorylation(40); and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin, aswell as actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly(9, 24). Recently, we used voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes todemonstrate direct PMT-mediated stimulation of the b1 iso-form of phospholipase C (PLCb1) and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway and to identify the im-mediate intracellular target of PMT as the free, monomeric asubunit of the Gq protein (43).During our earlier studies, we observed that specific anti-bodies against an N-terminal peptide of PMT, anti-toxA28\u201342,were able to block the PMT-mediated response in Xenopusoocytes (43). On the other hand, specific antibodies to a C-terminal peptide of PMT, anti-toxA1239\u20131253, did not block theactivity, strongly implying that the N terminus of PMT is crit-ical for its intracellular activity. The N-terminal half of therelated cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1) and CNF2from pathogenic Escherichia coli show homology to the Nterminus of PMT (10, 31). Comparisons of the amino acidsequence of PMT with those of other bacterial dermonecrotictoxins has been reported elsewhere (10, 27, 31, 42). Whilethere is homology in the C termini of the CNFs and the der-monecrotic toxin from Bordetella bronchiseptica (DNT), theC-terminal region of PMT does not have this similarity withthose of the CNFs and DNT (10, 27, 31, 42). As has beenshown for PMT, both DNT and the CNFs induce DNA syn-thesis, as well as actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesionassembly (19, 25, 31). For the CNFs and DNT, this activity hasbeen shown to occur through constitutive activation of thesmall G protein RhoA by deamidation of Gln-63 (11, 19, 31,37). The RhoA deamidase activity was reported to be localizedto the C terminus of CNF1 (27), and the receptor-bindingactivity was postulated to be in the N terminus. While all ofthese toxins have been shown to induce stress fiber formationand focal adhesion assembly, the molecular and functionalorganization of this group of toxins remains unclear. It is alsonot clear how the modification of RhoA by the CNFs and DNTand the modification of Gqa by PMT lead to each of theobserved intracellular changes.To define the functional domain of PMT responsible forintracellular activity, we cloned the entire toxA gene from P.multocida and expressed the corresponding recombinant PMT(rPMT) as a hexahistidine (His)-tagged fusion protein in E.coli. We confirmed that the full-length rPMT protein is asactive as native PMT in both oocyte and cell culture assays. Wethen constructed a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mu-* Corresponding author.

To screen for the functional domain ofPMT responsible for activation of the intracellular Gq-PLCb1-IP3 signaling pathway, the recombinant toxin proteins weremicroinjected into voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes to ob-serve the toxin-induced Ca21-dependent Cl2 current. Our re-sults localize the functional domain of PMT responsible forintracellular activity to the N terminus. To determine if thisfunctional domain alone possessed cytotoxic activity on intactcells, we also tested each of the recombinant proteins foreffects on cultured Vero cells and found that only the full-length rPMT protein is able to cause the morphological effectsinduced by native PMT.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against two synthetic peptides, compris-ing residues 28 to 42 of PMT (NSDFTVKGKSADEIF) and residues 1239 to1253 of PMT (PVDDWALEIAQRNRA), were obtained from Bio-Synthesis,Inc., using multiple antigen peptide conjugation methodology. The anti-peptideimmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (anti-toxA28\u201342 and anti-toxA1239\u20131253) werepurified by using a protein A-agarose column (PURE-1; Sigma). Goat anti-rabbitIgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and tetramethylrhodamine Bisothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Sigma. E.coli BL21(DE3) and the plasmid vectors pET-15b, pET-21b, and pET-33b wereobtained from Novagen. E. coli XL-1 Blue was obtained from Stratagene. TA-cloning kits, E. coli TOP10 and competent TOP10F9 One-Shot cells, and plasmidvectors pTrcHisC and pCR3-Uni were obtained from Invitrogen. Lipo-fectAMINE, the plasmid vector pROEX-1, and tissue culture media, sera, andreagents were obtained from Gibco/BRL. The plasmid vector pEGFP-N1 wasobtained from Clontech. Ni21-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose and Qiaex IIDNA purification kits were obtained from Qiagen. PCR primers were obtainedfrom Bio-Synthesis and Gibco/BRL. Restriction enzymes were obtained fromGibco/BRL or New England Biolabs. Centricon, Ultra-Free, and CentriconPlus-20 concentrators were obtained from Amicon/Millipore. Xenopus laevisfrogs were obtained from Xenopus I, Dexter, Mich. African green monkeykidney (Vero) cells (CCL-81) and murine Swiss 3T3 (CCL-92) and NIH 3T3(CRL-1658) fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type CultureCollection. P. multocida subsp. multocida 45/78 (NCTC 12178) was obtainedfrom the National Collection of Type Cultures and grown at 37\u00b0C on Trypticasesoy agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (BBL 11043). NativePMT was purchased from Sigma as a lyophilized powder with bovine serumalbumin and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerolprior to use. Native PMT, purified to homogeneity, quantified, and titered byVero cell cytotoxicity assays as described elsewhere (8), was a generous gift fromClarence Chrisp. All other reagents were of the highest quality commerciallyavailable.Construction of plasmids containing deletion mutants of PMT. All recombi-nant proteins were engineered to have either an N- or a C-terminal fusionpeptide containing a His tag, with all N-terminal fusion peptides also containinga thrombin proteolytic recognition site (Fig. 1). All cloning was carried out witheither E. coli XL-1 Blue or E. coli TOP10F9 One-Shot cells.Genomic DNA from P. multocida (NCTC 12178) was isolated as describedelsewhere (2) and used as a template for PCR. Primers 1 (coding, 59-CGCGGCAGCCATATGAAAACAAAACATTTTTTTAAC-39) and 2 (noncoding, 59-TATGCGAATTCATCATGCAATCCATTGTTTCAGATC-39) were used to cloneby PCR the region of the toxA gene, encoding the N-terminal 293 amino acids.The forward primer 1 incorporated an NdeI site (underscored) at the start of thegene (bold), and the reverse primer 2 incorporated an EcoRI site (underscored)and a stop codon (bold) after the codon for amino acid 293. The resulting PCRproduct was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and the NdeI/EcoRI fragment wasinserted into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET-15b, to yieldpET15b-toxAN1, which was sequence confirmed and used to express theToxAN1 protein. Plasmid pET15b-toxAN1 was used to generate the beginningregion of the toxA gene in all subsequent constructs encoding the N-terminalregion of PMT due to the lack of unique and practical restriction sites in the toxAgene.To clone the remaining portion of the toxA gene, genomic DNA from P.multocida (NCTC 12178) was exhaustively digested with HpaII. A 15-kb HpaIIfragment, shown by Southern blotting (2) to hybridize to a DNA probe generatedfrom the NdeI/EcoRI insert from pET15b-toxAN1 (data not shown), was used asa template to obtain the entire toxA gene by a three-step process using PCR. Inthe first step, two plasmids containing two overlapping fragments of the toxAgene were generated by TA cloning. Primers 1 and 3 (noncoding, 59-AAGACGTACCAGACGAATTTTATGT-39) were used to clone the region of the toxAgene encoding the N-terminal 521 amino acids into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-Uni to yield pCR3-Uni(1&3). Primers 4 (coding, 59-GTAGGAGAAGAATTACATTCTATCTCA-39) and 5 (noncoding, 59-GAATTGGGTACCTTATAGTGCTCTTGTTAAGCGAGG-39), with a KpnI site (underscored) and a stop codon(bold) incorporated into primer 5, were used to clone the region of toxA encod-ing the C-terminal 793 amino acids into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-Uni to yieldpCR3-Uni(4&5). In the second step, pCR3-Uni(1&3) was digested with StuI andXhoI, and the resulting StuI/XhoI fragment was inserted into the StuI/XhoI sitesof pET15b-toxAN1. Then an NcoI/XhoI toxA gene fragment from the resultingplasmid was subcloned into the expression vector pTrcHisC to yield pTHC-toxAN2, which was used to express the ToxAN2 protein. In the third step,pCR3-Uni(4&5) was digested with XhoI and KpnI, and the resulting XhoI/KpnItoxA gene fragment was inserted into the XhoI/KpnI sites of pTHC-toxAN2 toyield pTHC-toxA, which was used to express the full-length rPMT protein.A BamHI linker was inserted into the StuI site of pET15b-toxAN1, and aBamHI/EcoRI vector fragment from pET-15b was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pET15b-toxAN1, to yield pET15b-toxAN3, which was used toexpress the ToxAN3 protein. The NdeI/EcoRI insert from pET15b-toxAN1 wasfragment exchanged into pET-21b to yield pET21b-toxAN1. A NotI linker wasinserted into the SnaBI site of pTHC-toxA, and a StuI/NotI insert from pTHC-toxA was subcloned into the StuI/NotI sites of pET21b-toxAN1 to generatepET21b-toxAN4, which was used to express the ToxAN4 protein. The XhoI/KpnIinsert from pCR3-Uni(4&5) was subcloned into the XhoI/KpnI sites of theexpression vector pTrcHisC to yield pTHC-toxAC1, which was used to expressthe ToxAC1 protein. The SpeI/KpnI insert from pCR3-Uni(4&5) was subclonedinto the SpeI/KpnI sites of the expression vector pROEX-1 to generatepROEX1-toxAC2, which was used to express the ToxAC2 protein. With thepTHC-toxA plasmid serving as a DNA template for PCR, primers 6 (coding,59-CGCCGCGCCATGGCAACAAAACATTTTTTTAAC-39) and 7 (noncod-ing, 59-TGCTGCGGCCGCGCTGAATAATGCAGATTG-39), primers 6 and 8(noncoding, 59-GCGGCCGCTATTGCAGATAACTGTG-39), and primers6 and 9 (noncoding, 59-GCGGCCGCTTTGTTATCTTTTAAATGCCAT-39),with an NcoI site (underscored) incorporated at the start (bold) of the gene inprimer 6 and an NotI site (underscored) incorporated at the end of the genefragment in primers 7, 8, and 9, were used to generate by PCR three toxA-containing fragments that were ligated into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-Uni toyield pCR3-Uni(6&7), pCR3-Uni(6&8), and pCR3-Uni(6&9), respectively.NcoI/NotI inserts from each of the three plasmids were then subcloned into theexpression vector pET33b to yield pET33b-toxAN5, pET33b-toxAN6, andpET33b-toxAN7, respectively, which in turn were used to express the corre-sponding ToxAN5, ToxAN6, and ToxAN7 proteins.Expression of recombinant toxin proteins in E. coli. Recombinant proteinswere expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) for constructs generated in expressionvector pET15b, pET21b, pET33b, or pROEX-1 or in E. coli TOP10 for con-structs generated in expression vector pTrcHisC. Seed flasks containing 50 ml ofLB with the appropriate antibiotic, ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (25mg/ml), were inoculated with the desired bacterial colonies and incubated withvigorous shaking overnight at 37\u00b0C. Fermentation flasks containing 500 ml of LBwith ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (25 mg/ml) were inoculated with 8 to10 ml of the overnight seed culture and incubated with vigorous shaking at 37\u00b0Cuntil an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8 was reached. Expression of therecombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyr-anoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM, and growth was continued for3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 10 min in a SorvallRC-5C Plus centrifuge. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (100 ml per2.5-liter starting culture volume; 50 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.5] contain-ing 100 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 5 mg each of pepstatin, leupeptin,and aprotinin per ml, 2 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,FIG. 1.

MULTOCIDA TOXIN DELETION MUTATION ANALYSIS 810.2 mg of lysozyme per ml, 200 U of RNase A, and 1,500 U of DNase I). The cellsuspension was sonicated for four rounds of 1-min pulses at a duty cycle of 0.7in a Brau-Sonic-U cell disruptor, with 1-min cooling intervals on ice. Thecellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 3 g for 90 min, andthe supernatants were immediately used as cell extracts for further purifica-tion.Purification of recombinant toxin proteins. The His tag affinity handle allowedfor essentially one-step purification of the full-length and deletion mutant toxinsby nickel chelate affinity chromatography. Cell extracts were passed twicethrough a 5-ml/Ni21-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washedtwice with 50 ml of Ni column buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.5], 100mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole), followed by stepwiseelution with 50 ml each of Ni column buffer containing 20, 30, 60, 110, 160, and500 mM imidazole. Column fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting, and frac-tions containing the toxin proteins were pooled and concentrated in Centricon/Millipore concentrators to remove the imidazole and to exchange the buffer with50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol. To further desalt the samples,the concentrated solutions were passed through a PD-10 desalting column (Phar-macia).SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. To analyze dilute protein fractions or frac-tions containing high salt concentrations, samples were precipitated with anequal volume of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and microcentrifuged at 15,000 3g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min, washed twice with cold acetone, and then air dried. Proteinpellets were redissolved in a mixture of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), SDS-PAGEsample buffer, and tracking dye. Alternatively, SDS-PAGE sample buffer andtracking dye were added directly to protein samples. The protein samples werethen separated by SDS-PAGE on 8, 10, 11, or 16% gels. Protein bands werevisualized by Coomassie or silver staining and by Western blotting. For Westernblot analysis, proteins were first transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane andimmunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PMT, followed by secondarygoat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The imagesof gels and Western blots shown in Fig. 2 and 3 were obtained by using a ScanJet3C (Hewlett-Packard) with DeskScan II (Hewlett-Packard) image acquisitionsoftware, and the graphics were produced by using Adobe Photoshop on anApple Macintosh G3 computer.Removal of the His tag by thrombin treatment. The His tag peptide wasremoved from recombinant toxin proteins possessing N-terminal His tags(rPMT, ToxAN2, and ToxAN3) by thrombin treatment. The His-tagged protein(4 to 5 mg) and biotinylated thrombin (5 U; Novagen) in thrombin cleavagebuffer (500 ml; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.4], 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) wereincubated at room temperature for 16 to 20 h. Completion of reaction wasassessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. To terminate the reaction, streptavidin-agarosebeads (20 ml; Novagen) were added and the suspension was incubated for anadditional hour with gentle shaking. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at400 3 g for 30 s, and the supernatant was diluted with Ni column buffer (1 to 2ml) and passed twice through a 2- to 3-ml Ni21-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen)to remove the His tag peptide. Samples were desalted on PD-10 columns (Phar-macia) against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol and concen-trated in Centricon concentrators.Quantitation of recombinant toxin proteins. The concentration of His-taggedrPMT was determined by Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce), with bovineserum albumin as a standard. The concentration of the commercial native PMTsample was determined by image quantitation analysis of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, using His-tagged rPMT as a standard. The concentrations ofrPMT without the His tag, ToxAN2 without the His tag, ToxAN4, ToxAN5, andToxAC1 were determined by image quantitation analysis of the appropriatebands on Western blots with either anti-toxA28\u201342 or anti-toxA1239\u20131253 as theprimary antibody, using His-tagged rPMT as a standard. The concentrations ofToxAN3 without the His tag, ToxAN6, ToxAN7, and ToxAC2 were determinedby image quantitation analysis of the appropriate bands on Western blots witheither anti-toxA28\u201342 or anti-toxA1239\u20131253 as the primary antibody, usingToxAN4 as a standard. Western blots were imaged as described above, andimages were quantitated by using NIH Image (National Institutes of Health)image analysis software and Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft) data analysissoftware.Cell culture assays. Cultured cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 10% carbondioxide in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco/BRL), pH 7.4,supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL) forVero cells and NIH 3T3 cells) or 15% heat-inactivated calf serum (Gibco/BRL)for Swiss 3T3 cells, containing penicillin G (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100mg/ml) (Gibco/BRL). After trypsinization, cells were plated onto 12-well plates(Falcon) at a density of 4 3 104 (Vero cells) or 2 3 104 (Swiss 3T3 cells) per well,and incubation was continued with a change of medium after 24 h. Vero cells andSwiss 3T3 cells were allowed to reach confluency 5 days after plating, and thenthe medium was changed to DMEM\u20131% fetal bovine or calf serum (pH 7.4)containing antibiotics. Two days after quiescence with low-serum media, themedium was replaced with filter-sterilized, low-serum medium containing 200 ngof the native PMT, rPMT, and ToxAN4 proteins per ml, as well as controlscontaining the corresponding heat-inactivated proteins and no protein. The cellswere visualized after 1, 4, and 6 days of toxin exposure for morphological changesby phase-contrast microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope.Heat-inactivated controls of the protein samples were prepared by heating thesamples at 70\u00b0C for 45 min.Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with mammalian expression plasmids contain-ing an N-terminal fragment of PMT or green fluorescent protein (GEP). Cellswere cotransfected with a 1:1 ratio of pCR3-Uni(1&3) and pEGFP-N1 or withpEGFP-N1 alone, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Gibco/BRL) according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, NIH 3T3 cells wereplated at a density of 2 3 105 cells/well on six-well plates in antibiotic-freemedium. DNA plasmids (1 mg of each) in 100 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco/BRL) and4 ml of LipofectAMINE reagent in 100 ml of Opti-MEM were combined, incu-bated at room temperature for 15 min, and then added to each well containing800 ml of Opti-MEM. After 3 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, 1 ml of antibiotic-free,low-serum medium was added, and cells were further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hprior to staining and visualization.Fluorescence staining of transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing an N-terminalfragment of PMT. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline(PBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS,permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed twice withPBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin(2 mM; Sigma) in PBS, washed twice with PBS, and visualized by fluorescencemicroscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, equipped with U-MWB and U-MWIG fluorescence cubes for observing GFP and TRITC, respec-tively. Images were captured by using NIH Image 1.61, and micrographs weregenerated by using Adobe Photoshop 4.0.Oocyte preparation. Adult female X. laevis frogs (Xenopus I) were anesthe-tized by immersion in a 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate (Sigma), adjusted to pH7.4 with NaHCO3. A small incision was made on one side of the abdomen toremove several ovarian lobes. The lobes were gently torn apart and immersed ina Ca21-free OR-2 solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mMHEPES-Tris [pH 7.5]). Oocytes were defolliculated by incubation with collage-nase (2 mg/ml; Sigma type 1A) at room temperature (22 to 24\u00b0C) for 1 to 2 h. Theoocytes were then washed five times with OR-2 solution and five times with amodified Barth\u2019s solution [88 mM NaCl\u20131 mM KCl\u20132.4 mM NaHCO3\u20130.3 mMCa(NO3)2\u20130.4 mM CaCl2\u20130.8 mM MgSO4\u201315 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containingpenicillin G (100 mg/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)]. Stage 5\u20136 oocytes wereselected and stored at 18\u00b0C in modified Barth\u2019s solution.Two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Two microelectrodes, made by a verticalpuller (model PP-83, Narishige) and filled with 3 M KCl to give a resistance of1.5 to 2.0 megaohms, were used for voltage clamping. Voltage clamp experimentswere performed in a continuously perfused bath (10 ml/min) at room tempera-ture (22 to 24\u00b0C). The bath was connected through an Ag-AgCl-agar-3 M KClbridge to the two-electrode voltage clamp system (TEV-200 voltage clamp;Dagan). Membrane currents were measured in normal Ringer\u2019s solution (96 mMNaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 11.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4]).Data acquisition was performed by using MacLab/8s (ADInstruments) linked toa Macintosh Quadra 800 computer with Chart and Scope application software(ADInstruments). Graphics were obtained by using Cricket Graph III (Comput-er Associates).Oocyte microinjections. Microinjections of toxins, toxin fragments, and anti-bodies were performed under voltage-clamped conditions at 280-mV holdingpotential, using a pulse-controlled microinjector (Dagan model PMI-200). Tox-ins and other reagents were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5%glycerol prior to injection. For experiments involving anti-toxA28\u201342 inhibition ofToxAN4, protein A-purified antibodies were passed through a PD10 column in50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5% glycerol and concentrated such that an equalvolume could neutralize the rPMT response in oocytes. This antibody prepara-tion was then incubated in a 1:1 ratio with ToxAN4 on ice for 1 h prior toinjection.Data analysis and determination of EC50s. In all experiments reported here,each group of oocytes was tested for positive responses elicited by rPMT. Allresults are expressed as the mean 6 standard error of the maximal inwardcurrent assayed in oocytes from the same donor group. For the titration exper-iments, the same group of oocytes from a given donor was used for all dosestested. The number of oocytes used for data analysis at each dose is given inparentheses in Fig. 5. Fifty percent effective concentrations (EC50s) were calcu-lated with SigmaPlot (Jandell Scientific) by fitting data points to a logistic func-tion f(x) 5 a/{1 1 exp[b*(x 2 c)]}, where a is the maximum response observed,b is the slope, and c is the EC50. The EC50 curves shown in Fig. 5 were plottedby using Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates).Protein sequence and structure comparison between PMT and the CNFs andDNT. Primary sequence comparison between PMT, CNF1, CNF2, and DNT wasperformed by using the BestFit sequence analysis program from the GeneticsComputer Group Wisconsin Package with BLOSUM30 and BLOSUM62 aminoacid alignment scoring matrices. The secondary structure prediction for PMTand CNF1 was performed with the GOR-IV program available at http://absalpha.dcrt.nih.gov:8008/gor.html. The area plot shown in Fig. 7 was generated fromthe GOR-IV analysis results, with an additional smoothing window of 11 aminoacid residues for the helical probability, 5 amino acid residues for the extendedstrand probability, and the remainder for the coil probability.82 WILSON ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.RESULTSConstruction of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mu-tants of PMT. To define the specific region of PMT responsiblefor activation of the intracellular Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signalingpathway, we cloned the toxA gene, encoding the full-lengthPMT protein, and designed a series of N- and C-terminaldeletion mutants (Fig. 1). Expression plasmids containing theentire toxA gene or various deletion fragments thereof wereconstructed by using PCR and conventional cloning tech-niques. A plasmid containing the full-length toxA gene, pTHC-toxA, was generated by splicing three overlapping toxA frag-ments from cloning vectors containing the corresponding PCRproducts, pET15b-toxAN1, pCR3-Uni(1&3), and pCR3-Uni(4&5). The N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were obtainedfrom regions of the toxA gene encoding the N- and C-terminalportions of the PMT protein. The deletion mutants were de-signed such that all regions of the entire protein would beincluded in at least one of the deletion fragments. TheToxAN4 fragment containing the N-terminal 568 amino acidsof PMT included the region showing homology with the CNFs.Sequentially shorter N-terminal fragments, which could beused to further define the activity domain, were also designed;these included the N-terminal 505, 450, 400, 300, 293, and 93amino acids of PMT (ToxAN2, ToxAN5, ToxAN6, ToxAN7,ToxAN1, and ToxAN3, respectively). The two C-terminal frag-ments included the C-terminal 780 amino acids of PMT(ToxAC1) and the C-terminal 226 amino acids (ToxAC2). Thevarious toxA deletion fragments were subcloned into E. coliexpression vectors which incorporated a His tag affinity handleat either the N- or C terminus of the protein, as indicated inFig. 1.Expression, purification, and quantitation of rPMT andPMT deletion mutant proteins. We expressed the recombinanttoxin proteins under IPTG-inducible promoters in E. coli asHis-tagged fusion peptides for ease in purification. The His tagallowed for essentially one-step purification of the proteins,thereby reducing the amount of sample handling and decreas-ing the likelihood of protein denaturation or inactivation. Dur-ing the course of our initial studies, we observed that the Histag placed at the N terminus of rPMT interfered with theactivity of the protein in the Xenopus oocyte assay system, aswell as in tissue culture assays (data not shown). Hence, fol-lowing Ni21 chelate chromatography, we opted to remove theHis tag by thrombin cleavage from all of the N-terminal frag-ments having His tag at their N-termini, including rPMT,ToxAN1, ToxAN2, and ToxAN3. The ToxAN1 protein with aHis tag at the N terminus was difficult to purify (Fig. 2) and wasnot stable to subsequent thrombin treatment, and we could notobtain quantities adequate to assay for activity. ToxAN7 wassimilar in length to ToxAN1. The His tag was placed at the Ctermini of ToxAN4, ToxAN5, ToxAN6, and ToxAN7. TheC-terminal His tag was not removed from these recombinantproteins. For ToxAC1 and ToxAC2, the N-terminal His tagwas placed at the N terminus but was not removed.The degree of purification achieved by use of the His tagaffinity handle varied somewhat among the proteins. Repre-sentative Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels andWestern blots of each of the toxin samples used in this studyare shown in Fig. 2. Because of the differences in samplepurity, we chose to quantitate the protein concentration ofeach toxin sample by Western blot analysis, comparing thesample against a standard curve generated from purified His-tagged rPMT or ToxAN4 of known concentration.Comparison of rPMT with native PMT.

MULTOCIDA TOXIN DELETION MUTATION ANALYSIS 83in oocyte experiments (Fig. 4A and B), although the highlypurified PMT and rPMT samples were at least 20-fold moreactive than the commercial native PMT sample. However, af-ter determining the concentrations of the impure native PMTsamples by analyzing silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels,using purified rPMT as a standard, we found that the commer-cial native PMT was as active as rPMT. When the EC50s wereadjusted accordingly, the native and recombinant toxins exhib-ited similar responses in oocytes, with EC50s of 5.2 and 3.6fmol/oocyte, respectively (Fig. 5A and B). Anti-toxA28\u201342, butnot anti-toxA1239\u20131253, specifically inhibited the activities ofboth native and recombinant toxin samples in oocyte experi-ments (reference 43 and data not shown). As depicted in Fig.6, rPMT caused dramatic morphological effects on confluent,quiescent Vero cells, showing focus formation surrounded byenlarged cells, as well as proliferative effects on confluent,quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. Native PMT caused similar effects(data not shown), although the rPMT sample consistently ap-peared to be more potent than the commercial native PMT sam-ple. The results from these studies are summarized in Table 1.Activities of N- and C-terminal deletion fragments of PMT.The C-terminal PMT fragments, ToxAC1 and ToxAC2, andthe smaller N-terminal fragments, ToxAN3, ToxAN6, andToxAN7, exhibited no detectable responses in the oocyte assayat concentrations as high as 1 pmol/oocyte. In contrast, ToxAN4,consisting of the N-terminal 568 amino acids, gave reproduc-ible responses in oocytes (Fig. 4C) with an EC50 of 22 fmol/oocyte (Fig. 5C), compared to 3.6 fmol/oocyte for the full-length rPMT. ToxAN2, consisting of the N-terminal 505 aminoacids, also showed a reproducible activity (Fig. 4D), with anEC50 of 140 fmol/oocyte (Fig. 5D), about 40-fold lower thanthat for full-length rPMT. ToxAN5, consisting of the N-termi-nal 450 amino acids, gave detectable responses in oocytes (Fig.4E), but the responses were so weak that it was not possible toaccurately determine an EC50 for this mutant protein withinjection of as much as 3 pmol. Unlike the full-length rPMT,none of the N- or C-terminal deletion mutants exhibited aneffect on cultured Vero cells (data not shown). The resultsfrom these studies are summarized in Table 1.To determine whether the N terminus of PMT could alsotrigger downstream signaling events in mammalian fibroblasts,leading to changes in cellular morphology, a mammalian ex-pression plasmid containing the N-terminal 521 amino acids ofPMT under the cytomegalovirus promoter was cotransfectedinto NIH 3T3 cells along with a reporter plasmid containingGFP under the same promoter. In vitro translation assaysusing pCR3-Uni(1&3) were also performed to ensure that theconstruct was indeed capable of expressing truncated toxinprotein (data not shown). We found that cells cotransfectedwith both plasmids underwent significant morphological re-sponses compared to control cells transfected with reporterplasmid alone. As shown in Fig. 7, control cells expressing onlythe GFP protein have a characteristic spread-out fibroblastmorphology, whereas cells expressing the N-terminal fragmentof PMT and GFP have a more retracted and spindly appearance,with evidence of more intense TRITC-phalloidin staining.DISCUSSIONEvidence from previous studies suggests that the mode ofaction of PMT involves binding to cell surface receptors andinternalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis (34, 36), fol-FIG. 4.

Sincethe average maximal response observed varied from donor group to donorgroup, all data points for each EC50 curve were obtained with the same batch ofoocytes from a single donor. EC50s were determined from the data by usingSigmaPlot (see Materials and Methods) and are summarized in Table 1.84 WILSON ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.lowed by activation of various signaling pathways (29, 30, 38\u201340, 43), leading eventually to morphological and proliferativeevents (9, 17, 18, 21, 24, 29, 36). In our earlier studies, wedemonstrated that intact PMT protein could directly activatethe Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signaling pathway in Xenopus oocytes(43). Using this system, we bypassed the cell-binding and in-ternalization process by direct microinjection of the toxin,apparently without the requirement for further intracellularprocessing or activation. In the present work, we report thecloning, expression, and purification of fully active recombi-nant PMT from E. coli. This full-length recombinant proteinhas an activity in oocytes similar to that of the native toxinisolated from P. multocida. We have also shown that rPMT hasan effect on cultured Vero cells similar to that of the nativetoxin.We have demonstrated that a recombinant deletion mutantconsisting of the N-terminal 568 amino acids of PMT couldelicit a PMT-like response in oocytes, while two mutants con-sisting of the C-terminal 780 and 226 amino acids gave nodetectable response at higher doses. Weaker responses werealso observed with mutants consisting of the N-terminal 505and 450 amino acids but not with shorter N-terminal frag-ments. We thus conclude that the functional domain respon-sible for activating the intracellular Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signalingpathway in Xenopus oocytes is localized to the N terminus ofPMT.The N-terminal 500 residues of PMT have 24 to 27% ho-mology to the N-terminal 500 residues of CNF1 and CNF2 (10,31). As can be seen from the area plot shown in Fig. 8, thepredicted secondary structures of PMT and CNF1 also havelimited similarity in this region, particularly in the region withFIG. 6. Effects of recombinant PMT on confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3 and Vero cells. Shown are representative phase-contrast micrographs of confluent, quiescentSwiss 3T3 (left-hand pairs of panels) and Vero cells (right-hand pairs of panels) treated as described in Materials and Methods without (A to C and G to I) or with(D to F and J to L) rPMT (200 ng/well) for 18 h (A, D, G, and J), 96 h (B, E, H, and K), or 144 h (C, F, I, and L).TABLE 1.

MULTOCIDA TOXIN DELETION MUTATION ANALYSIS 8530% homology between residues 200 and 450 of PMT. Wehave shown that deletion mutations made within this con-served region resulted in loss of intracellular activity. Withlocalization of the intracellular activity domain to the N-ter-minal 500 amino acid residues of PMT, the sequence andstructural similarity in the N-terminal region between the twotoxins suggests that CNF1 and CNF2 may have an intracellularactivity similar to that of PMT. However, there are sufficientdifferences between the toxins within this region, as indicatedin the secondary structure prediction profiles (Fig. 8), for it tobe feasible that they have different intracellular activities andtarget preferences. CNF1 and CNF2 possess deamidase activ-ity on RhoA (11, 19, 31, 37). The deamidase activity domain ofCNF1 has been reported to be located in the C-terminal 300residues (27), which shares about 20% homology with theC-terminal 300 residues of DNT but has no discernible se-quence similarity with PMT. It is possible that the N-terminalregion of CNF1 with homology to the N-terminal region ofPMT possesses an intracellular activity different from the ac-tivity associated with the C-terminal 300 residues of CNF1.In our previous study (43), we showed that antibodies spe-cific for the N terminus of PMT blocked the PMT-inducedresponse in oocytes, but antibodies against the C terminus didnot. The N-terminal toxin fragments ToxAN4 and ToxAN2 areable to elicit responses in oocytes similar to those elicited byfull-length rPMT. Antibodies to the N terminus of PMT alsoblocked the ToxAN4-induced response in oocytes, yet ToxAN4had no effect on cultured Vero cells. Moreover, none of thedeletion mutants exhibited an effect on Vero cells. This isconsistent with earlier findings that deletion mutants lackingN-terminal (D28-149 and D175-247) or C-terminal (D1130-1285) portions of the PMT protein had no toxic activity inassays for cytopathicity on embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells,dermonecrosis in guinea pigs, or mouse lethality (33). Previousstudies also showed that monoclonal antibodies recognizing anepitope in the C-terminal 155 amino acids of PMT blocked thecytopathic effect of PMT on EBL cells (13, 33). The C-terminalfragments ToxAC1 and ToxAC2 were inactive in the oocyteassay and had no effect on cultured Vero cells, thus supportingthe notion that only the N terminus of PMT has intracellularactivity and the C terminus of PMT is required for toxin entryinto cells. Further study is required to determine the precisebiochemical activity of PMT that induces the Gqa-PLCb1-IP3signaling pathway and to understand how this PMT-associatedactivity and the CNF-associated deamidase activity could resultin the observed changes in cells caused by these toxins.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by grant AI38396 from the National Insti-tutes of Health/NIAID (to B.A.W.).We thank Xinjun Zhu, Brooke Murphy, Tina Caserta, AprilBuehler, James Burgett, and Jennifer Williams for technical assistance.We especially thank Adrian Corbett for helpful discussions and gen-erous assistance in setting up the electrophysiological equipment,Hangjun Zhan for helpful discussions and assistance in the initialcloning stages of this project, and Steven Berberich for assistance within vitro translation assays.
