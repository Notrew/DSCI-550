However, the global regulation of RIG-Isignaling is only partially understood. Using a human genome-wide RNAi-screen, we identified 226 novel regulatoryproteins of RIG-I mediated interferon-b production. Furthermore, the screen identified a metabolic pathway that synthesizesthe inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as a previously unrecognized positive regulator of interferon production. Detailed geneticand biochemical experiments demonstrated that the kinase activities of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (which convert IP5 to1-IP7) were critical for both interferon induction, and the control of cellular infection by Sendai and influenza A viruses.Conversely, ectopically expressed inositol pyrophosphate-hydrolases DIPPs attenuated interferon transcription. Mechanisticexperiments in intact cells revealed that the expression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 was needed for the phosphorylationand activation of IRF3, a transcription factor for interferon. The addition of purified individual inositol pyrophosphates to acell free reconstituted RIG-I signaling assay further identified 1-IP7 as an essential component required for IRF3 activation.The inositol pyrophosphate may act by b-phosphoryl transfer, since its action was not recapitulated by a syntheticphosphonoacetate analogue of 1-IP7. This study thus identified several novel regulators of RIG-I, and a new role for inositolpyrophosphates in augmenting innate immune responses to viral infection that may have therapeutic applications.Citation: Pulloor NK, Nair S, Kostic AD, Bist P, Weaver JD, et al.

The first step in the innate immune responseinvolves recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns byseveral host encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRR). A keymediator of antiviral immunity is the type-I interferon family ofcytokines, which are transcribed upon detection of RNA viruses bythe pattern recognition receptors [1\u20133]. Cells have developedPRRs that are specialized for detecting pathogens in the cytosol,the site where many RNA viruses replicate. One such PRR is theretinoic acid inducible gene - I (RIG-I) [1\u20133]. RIG-I recruits theadaptor protein MAVS to activate a signaling pathway that causesTBK1 to phosphorylate the latent transcription factor IRF3 [4\u20137].Signaling cascades triggered by multiple PRRs indeed converge toactivate IRF3. Once phosphorylated, IRF3 dimerizes andtranslocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with thetranscriptional coactivators CBP/p300, which together stimulatethe expression of type-I interferon [1]. This initiates the antiviralimmune responses [8\u201310].An optimal interferon response is essential to control viralinfections; however, excessive interferon exposure is detrimental tothe human body [11]. Significant research effort has been investedin determining the nature of the positive and negative signalingpathways which regulate the responses that RIG-1 elicits followingPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981viral infection [1,2,5,6,12\u201318]. Yet, there are significant gaps inour understanding of how an appropriate interferon response isregulated. For example, the regulation of the coupling of RIG-Istimulation to the activation of IRF3 is not completely understood.In particular, it has not previously been well determined if anydiffusible second messenger molecules have signaling roles in thispathway. In addition, a comparative understanding of theregulation of the unique RIG-I specific upstream and theconserved (across PRRs) downstream steps of interferon produc-tion is still lacking. In any case, the innate immune system is acomplex, multifactorial network of interconnected pathways thatexhibit combinatorial effects and emergent properties [19]; this isan entity that is much more than the sum of its individualcomponents. Systems-level analysis therefore offers the mostpromising approach to a comprehensive understanding of theregulation of innate immune pathways such as the interferonresponse; this information can also be exploited for the develop-ment of novel therapeutic targets [20]. Some previous studies usedproteomics and gene expression profiling approaches to under-stand the global regulation of innate immune response duringseveral RNA viral infections [21,22]. However, a systematicinterrogation of the role of all of the annotated genes of humangenome in the RIG-I signaling and interferon production is yet tobe reported.In this study, through a systems level approach using humangenome wide RNA-interference (RNAi) screen, bioinformaticsanalysis and mechanistic validations, we generated an expandedunderstanding of the regulation of RIG-I mediated interferonresponse. We have identified 226 novel components of the RIG-1pathway. In particular, the approach we took in the current studyled us to identify that a class of kinases that synthesizes inositolpyrophosphates are important positive regulators of the type-Iinterferon response. The inositol pyrophosphates (also known asdiphosphoinositol polyphosphates) are a specialized subgroup ofthe inositol phosphate signaling family that is distinguished by thepresence of high-energy diphosphate groups [23\u201325]. The inositolpyrophosphates are known to regulate DNA damage repair [26],apoptosis [27,28], insulin exocytosis [29], and insulin signaling[30]. Although a role for inositol pyrophosphates in regulatingneutrophil function has also recently emerged [31], it has notpreviously been reported whether they play any role in antiviralimmunity. Now, we demonstrate for the first time that thesynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates is critical for type-I interferontranscription and antiviral immunity.ResultsGenome-Wide Screening Identifies Regulators ofRIG-I-Mediated IFNb ProductionTo discover novel genes regulating the RIG-I mediatedinterferon response, we performed a human genome wide RNA-interference (RNAi) screen. A quantitative fluorescence microsco-py based assay was adopted for the screen using human interferon-b (IFNb) promoter- driven green fluorescent protein reporter(IFNb-GFP) (Figure 1A). The assay used human embryonic kidney(HEK) 293 cell line, a widely used model system to dissect RIG-Isignaling [15,32,33]. As HEK293 cells do not have a robust TLR3expression, the use of this cell line would minimize the effects fromnon-RIG-I pathways [34]. As reported earlier [33], becauseHEK293 cells express only moderate levels of RIG-I, transfectionof IFNb-GFP reporter along with the RIG-I ligand Polyinosinic:-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) into these cells leads to only a modestincrease in the GFP signal (Figure S1A). However, transfection ofRIG-I expression plasmid into these cells leads to a very robustactivation of GFP signal, both with and without poly (I:C)stimulation (Figure S1A). In control experiments, silencing of RIG-I, MAVS and IRF3, drastically reduced the RIG-I transfectionmediated IFNb-GFP signal, but there was no effect upon silencingeither TRIF (TLR3 adaptor) or MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR ofviruses) (Figure S1B). These experiments prove that the observedreporter activity was originating specifically through RIG-I.For the RNAi screen, we selected a condition where, 24 hr afterthe transfection of a RIG-I expression plasmid (with poly (I:C)stimulation), IFNb-GFP transcription was observed in approxi-mately 25% of the cells. In comparison, only 1\u20132% of the totalcells were GFP-positive after silencing of the positive control genesMAVS and IRF3, representing a 26.5- and 14.3-fold decrease inIFNb-GFP reporter activity respectively (Figure S1B). Highcontent microscopy based imaging was used to detect and quantifythe degree of activation of the IFNb reporter. For every image, wecalculated the GFP intensity per cell (defined as a DAPI stainednucleus), after setting an intensity threshold to identify the GFPexpressing cells. The final readout of the assay was the percent ofGFP-positive cells per well.The screen was conducted in two stages (Figure 1A). Theprimary screen involved silencing 18,120 human genes using apool of four unique siRNAs (from Dharmacon) targeting eachgene. Later, the \u2018\u2018hit genes\u2019\u2019 from the primary screen were furthervalidated for on-target specificity by testing each of the fourindividual siRNAs of the pool separately, and only those for whichat least two independent siRNAs impacted on reporter signal wereselected. A Z-score of (2/+) 2.5 was taken as cut-off for putativepositive or negative regulators, respectively. The analytic param-eters for the siRNA screen including the signal intensity andZ-score distributions are given in the Figures S2A\u2013D. We re-identified several previously known regulators of RIG-I pathwaysuch as RIG-I, IRF3, TRIM21, PRKR and MAVS as hits,validating the ability of the screen to discover proteins thatregulate the interferon response [35,36]. More importantly, theRNAi screen led to the identification of a total of 226 additionalAuthor SummaryThe innate immune system is critical for viral infectioncontrol by host organisms. The type I interferons are afamily of major antiviral cytokines produced upon theactivation of innate immune pattern recognition receptors(PRRs) by viruses. The RIG-I is a major PRR that uniquelydetects RNA viruses within the cytoplasm. In this study, weaimed to discover cellular genes and pathways that playregulatory roles in the transcriptional induction of type Iinterferon-b (IFNb). Using a human genome wide RNAinterference (RNAi) screening, we identified 226 geneswhose expression is important for proper IFNb production.Through bioinformatics-based mining of the RNAi screenresults, we identified that the cellular pathway synthesiz-ing inositol pyrophosphates, a class of inositol phosphateswith high-energy diphosphates, is a key positive regulatorof RIG-I mediated IFNb production. The kinases IPPK,PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, that synthesize inositol pyrophos-phate 1-IP7, regulated IFNb response in a catalyticallydependent manner. Mechanistic studies identified that 1-IP7 synthesis pathway was needed for efficient phosphor-ylation of IRF3. The DIPP family of inositol pyrophosphatehydrolases negatively regulated the IFNb response, uponectopic expression. In summary, this study generated aglobal view of the regulation of RIG-I signaling, andidentified inositol pyrophosphates as important regulatorsof antiviral response.Interferon Response and Inositol PyrophosphatesPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981novel regulators of RIG-I mediated IFNb response (Table S1). Outof these, 220 and 6 genes respectively were positive and negativeregulators of RIG-I signaling.We subsequently performed detailed bioinformatics analysis tomine the information contained within the RNAi screen results. Ameta-analysis using the Gene Expression Omnibus databaserevealed that 33 of the identified RNAi hits were previouslyobserved as host genes upregulated upon exposure to various RNAviruses, interferon or poly (I:C) [21,37\u201340] (Table S1). Networkanalysis of the obtained hit genes revealed that several proteinspreviously implicated to interact with components of interferonresponse, but not determined yet to serve a regulatory role ininterferon response, (e.g, ADAP2 [41]) are indeed needed foroptimal interferon induction (Figure 1B). In addition, genesserving different functions such as those regulating nucleartransport (RAN, XPO1), ubiquitin like proteins (UBQLN2, UBL5)and transcription (e.g., DLX3) were also among the identified hits(Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified severalstatistically significant cellular functional categories of genesregulating interferon production (Figure 1C). Most of the top-ranked GO categories identified were those related to antiviralinnate immune signaling. Remarkably, gene ontology analysis alsoidentified the pathway involving biosynthesis of inositol pyrophos-phates as a novel cellular process associated with interferonresponse regulation (Figure 1C). Overall, our functional genomicsinterrogation revealed that genes and pathways from diversefunctional categories are regulators of RIG-I mediated interferonproduction.RIG-I Regulators Act at Multiple Steps of the PRRSignaling CascadeIn order to begin to generate a global mechanistic understand-ing of the newly discovered regulators of IFNb response, weattempted to place these genes in the known framework of RIG-Isignaling. It is known that ectopic expression of MAVS, TBK1and a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (termed IRF3-5D) canstimulate IFNb transcription, independent of RIG-I [9,17,42]. Bycoupling the ectopic expression of these genes with individualsilencing of the newly identified regulators, we generated a detailedmap of the functional localization of their action within the RIG-IFigure 1.

The results of the \u2018\u2018stage determination assays\u2019\u2019 areshown in Figure 1A (displayed inside the brown box) and TableS1. Among the 226 hit genes, the greatest number (55%) wasidentified to serve a regulatory role upstream of MAVS. Amongthe rest, 5.5%, 11.3% and 25% of the total hit genes were found tofunction between MAVS and TBK1, between TBK1 and IRF3,and downstream of IRF3, respectively. In summary, this forwardgenetics study revealed a global picture of the stage wisedistribution of 226 novel regulators of RIG-I signaling cascade.The Inositol Pyrophosphate Biosynthesis Pathway IsEssential for RIG-I Dependent Interferon ProductionBioinformatics analysis of the RNAi screening results identifiedthe kinase PPIP5K2 as a positive regulator of RIG-1 signaling(Figure 1A, and 1B). PPIP5K2 is one of the enzymes that directlysynthesizes inositol pyrophosphates (Figure 1D). In relation to this,IPPK is another kinase that was also identified in the screen as apositive regulator of RIG-1 signaling; IPPK synthesizes IP6, whichserves as the common precursor material for inositol pyrophos-phate synthesis. The key steps and enzymes involved in inositolpyrophosphate biosynthesis are shown in Figure 1D. The beststudied inositol pyrophosphates in mammals are the two IP7isomers (1-IP7 and 5-IP7) and IP8 [43]. These are synthesized bytwo classes of enzymes, the IP6Ks and the PPIP5Ks [44\u201349].The inositol pyrophosphate pathway has not previously beenimplicated as participating in antiviral responses, so we set out tofurther characterize its role in innate immunity. We first validatedthat the siRNAs against IPPK efficiently knocked down geneexpression (Figure 2A). Moreover, Following stimulation of thesecells by transfection with RIG-I ligand poly (I:C), the knock-downof IPPK expression was confirmed to cause a major reduction ofIFNb-promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2A). We also usedq-RTPCR based quantification of IFNb transcripts to verify therole of IPPK in influencing IFNb transcript synthesis (Figure 2B).Finally, transfection of siRNA resistant IPPK cDNA expressingplasmid into endogenous IPPK silenced cells using 39-UTRtargeting siRNA led to the recovery of the IFNb response to a levelcomparable to that in normal cells, indicating the on-targetspecificity of gene silencing (Fig. S3A).The silencing of IPPK will not only reduce the formation of IP6but also the synthesis of the inositol pyrophosphates 1-IP7, 5-IP7and IP8 (Figure 1D). The kinases PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 catalyzethe synthesis of 1-IP7 and IP8, but not 5-IP7 (Figure 1D). Indeed,the RNAi screen also identified PPIP5K2, but not PPIP5K1, as aRIG-1 regulator (see above). So we next investigated if the inositolpyrophosphates play roles in innate immunity. Silencing of thePPIP5K2 gene strongly reduced RIG-I driven IFNb transcriptionand IFNb promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2B,C). Wealso retested PPIP5K1 since it was possible that the latter wasmissed in the primary screen. Notably, PPIP5K1 gene silencingalso reduced the IFNb reporter activity. Gene silencing wasverified by both Western blot (Figure 2C) and q-RTPCR (FigureS3B). The q-RTPCR based quantification also showed a notabledecrease in the IFNb transcript production in PPIP5K2 silencedcells (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure S3A, ectopic expression ofsiRNA resistant PPIP5K2 rescued the loss of IFNb responsecaused by ablation of endogenous PPIP5K2 using 39-UTRtargeting siRNA, confirming the on-target specificity of theknockdown. The knockdown of IPPK and PPIP5Ks did notsignificantly affect basal-level IFNb or IFNa production whenHEK293 cells were not stimulated by either RIG-I ectopicexpression or transfection with poly (I:C) or infection with virus(Figure S3C, S3D). Using JAK1 silenced cells, it was furtherdetermined that the observed effects of IPPK, PPIP5K1 andPPIP5K2 silencing on interferon response are independent of theautocrine amplification of the pathway (Figure S3E).We next investigated the possible roles of the IP6Ks (IP6K1,IP6K2 and IP6K3) which participate in the synthesis of 5-IP7 andIP8, but not 1-IP7 Figure 1D). Although none of these genes wereidentified from our genome-wide RNAi screen, we re-investigatedtheir role in RIG-I signaling with validation of gene silencing. Itwas observed that both individual and simultaneous silencing ofIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 genes did not affect the interferontranscription (Figure 2D). Furthermore, consistent with the geneknockdown data, fibroblasts from IP6K1 gene deficient mouse didnot show any defect in the IFNb response (Figure S3F) [50]. Thefact that the IFNb response is inhibited by knock-down of PPIP5Ksbut not IP6Ks (Figure 2) suggests that 1-IP7, but not 5-IP7(Figure 1D), has functional significance in the innate immuneresponse. Complete loss of expression of murine IP6K1 (or theKcs1 homologue in yeast) was previously shown to adversely affectthe functioning of mitochondria, and alters ATP levels [51].However, no significant general cytotoxicity, mitochondrialtoxicity or change in the levels of cellular ATP was found in cellstransiently silenced for IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (FigureS4A).The experiments described above used poly (I:C) in order tomimic a cellular viral infection. It is therefore significant that wealso found silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 dampenedIFNb transcription during infection of HEK293 cells by Sendaivirus (SeV), a known stimulator of RIG-I [52] (Figure 2E). Tofurther validate the physiological relevance of IPPK, PPIP5K1 andPPIP5K2 in IFNb production, we also silenced the expression ofthese kinases in human primary monocyte derived macrophages,and then challenged them with Sendai virus. We found asignificant decrease in IFNb transcription in these RNAi-targetedhuman primary macrophages (Figure 2F). No notable difference inSeV induced IFNb response was observed when IP6K1-3 geneswere silenced (not shown). These experiments further indicate thatthe expression of the kinases involved in the synthesis of 1-IP7 isimportant for an effective interferon response.The Inositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis PathwaySpecifically Regulates the Interferon Axis from MultiplePRRsIn addition to the transcriptional induction of IFNb, signalingfrom several of the PRRs that sense RNA viruses also result in theproduction of another class of type-I interferons, the IFNa, as wellas activation of the transcription factor NFkB [5]. Therefore it wasimportant to determine whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases are also required for the IFNa and NFkB responsefrom RIG-I. We observed that silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 andPPIP5K2 in HEK293 cells led to a reduction in RIG-I mediatedtranscription of IFNa, determined using a luciferase reporterdriven by the IFNa4 promoter (Figure 2G). However, inositolpyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases were not required forRIG-I triggered NFkB activation (Figure 2H). This data indicatedthat these kinases regulate a step of RIG-I signaling that happensafter the bifurcation of interferon and NFkB branches.In addition to RIG-I, there are several other PRRs such asTLR3 (an endosomal PRR) and MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR),which also induce IFNb transcription [1]. Therefore we investi-gated the specificity of the inositol pyrophosphates-synthesis-pathway kinases with regards to signaling by other PRRs. Wefound that repression of the expression of either IPPK, PPIP5K1or PPIP5K2 attenuated the IFNb response elicited by both TLR3and MDA5, to a level comparable to that observed in the case ofRIG-I (Figure 2I).

Indeed, theIFNb induction arising from ectopic expression of MAVS andTBK1, two key downstream components of RIG-I pathway, wasdiminished when IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 were silenced(Figure 3A). These data further indicate that the inositolpyrophosphates most likely regulate a step at the level orimmediately downstream of TBK1. Because activation of IRF3happens immediately downstream of TBK1, we next investigatedthe effect of interference with inositol pyrophosphate synthesispathway gene expression on IRF3 functioning. The IRF3 exists asa monomer in its unstimulated state in the cytosol. When PRRsare stimulated, the phosphorylation of monomeric IRF3 leads toits homo-dimerization, followed by nuclear migration. We firstinvestigated whether inositol pyrophosphate synthesis was neededfor the nuclear translocation of activated endogenous IRF3. Incontrol experiments, the negative control siRNA treated HEK293cells were stimulated with poly (I:C), which led to a prominentnuclear accumulation of phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3; Figure 3B).In additional control experiments, silencing of MAVS, the keyadaptor of RIG-I, reduced the nuclear levels of pIRF3 (Figure 3B).Notably, there was also a major reduction in the intra-nuclearlevels of endogenous pIRF3 following silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1and PPIP5K2 (Figure 3B, 3C).Next, we investigated whether the depletion of IPPK, PPIP5K1and PPIP5K2 altered endogenous IRF3 dimerization. Theknockdown of all three of these genes strongly reduced the degreeof IRF3 dimerization that was induced by poly (I:C)(Figure 3D,E),compared to that observed in negative control siRNA treated cells.The levels of GAPDH and Tubulin proteins were unaffected bythe knockdown of these kinases, indicating there was not a globalperturbation of protein expression (Figures 3B, 3F).We finally determined whether poly (I:C) induced phosphory-lation of endogenous IRF3 was affected by silencing of inositolpyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases. Notably, it was foundthat knock-down of the expression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 andPPIP5K2 caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of endoge-nous IRF3 (Figure 3F, 3G). In summary, the experimentsdescribed above argue that the expression of inositol pyrophos-phate-synthesis pathway kinases is required for the TBK1-IRF3axis to function; the absence of inositol pyrophosphate synthesiscompromised IRF3 phosphorylation and dimer formation.Inositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis Pathway RegulatesInterferon Response in a Catalytically Dependent MannerHaving established the involvement of the inositol pyrophos-phate-synthesis-pathway as a regulator of antiviral response, wefurther sought to identify the mechanism by which this pathwaymodulates interferon signaling. We first investigated whetherenhancing the cellular expression of these kinases has any effect onthe interferon response. Indeed it was determined that the ectopicexpression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 induced a significantdose dependent enhancement of RIG-I driven IFNb promoterreporter activity, in both the cells that were either stimulated orunstimulated with poly (I:C) (Figure 4A). However, the enhancingeffect of ectopic expression of these genes on the IFNb reporteractivity in cells pre-transfected with RIG-I and poly (I:C) wasgreater than that in the unstimulated cells (Figure 4A). BothPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 ectopic expression caused a greaterenhancement of the IFNb response than did by IPPK. Eventhough silencing of IP6Ks did not affect IFNb response, we alsoinvestigated whether the ectopic expression of IP6K1-3 has anyeffect on IFNb response. Interestingly, the ectopic expression ofIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb responsesignificantly, although to a lesser degree than that promoted byoverexpression of either PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figure 4B). Thesedata revealed that the interferon response could be augmented byover-expression of any of the tested kinases in the inositolpyrophosphate synthesis pathway.In order to determine whether the kinase activity of theseproteins is important for the interferon transcription, we nexttransfected cells with catalytically-inactive mutants. These mutantproteins were found to express at levels comparable to thecorresponding wild type kinases. Remarkably, the kinase deficientmutants of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 all exhibited adecreased ability to facilitate the interferon response upon overexpression, when compared with the corresponding wild typeproteins (Figure 4C). In addition, we noted an earlier report thatthe kinase domain of PPIP5K1 (PPIP5K1-KD) and PPIP5K2(PPIP5K2-KD) was able to catalyze the formation of 1-IP7, withgreater efficiency than the full-length protein [47]. As shown inFigure 4D, indeed we found that over expression of bothPPIP5K1-KD and PPIP5K2-KD enhanced the IFNb reporteractivity to an extent greater than that induced by full lengthPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2. We also found that inactivation of thecatalytic activity of IP6K1 significantly diminished its ability toenhance IFNb response upon ectopic expression (Figure 4C).However, consistent with the gene knockdown data showing norole for endogenous IP6Ks in RIG-I signaling, HEK293 cellstreated with IP6K kinase inhibitor TNP (N2-[m-Trifluorobenzyl],N6-[p-nitrobenzyl] purine) did not show any defect in IFNbresponse (Figure S3G) [53]. These experiments demonstrated thatthe inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases regulatedIFNb transcription through their catalytic activities. That is, one ormore of the soluble inositol pyrophosphates products are requiredfor IFNb production.The ability of ectopically expressed PPIP5K1/2 to stimulateinterferon transcription (Figure 4A) could result from increasedsynthesis of either 1-IP7 and/or IP8 (Figure 1D). For IP8 to beinvolved, IP6K activity would also be required. However, thestimulatory effects of over-expressed PPIP5K1/2 were not affectedby either individual or simultaneous silencing of IP6K1-3(Figure 3E). Moreover, in control experiments, silencing of IPPKnearly completely abolished the ability of ectopically expressedPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 to enhance interferon transcription(Figure 4F). That result is consistent with the requirement forIP6 as the precursor molecule for phosphorylation by PPIP5K1/2to synthesize 1-IP7 (Figure 1D). It was also observed that thediminished interferon response caused by PPIP5K1 silencingcould be compensated by over expressed PPIP5K2, or vice versa(Figure 4G). These data indicate that 1-IP7 mediates the interferontranscriptional effects of the PPIP5K1/2.Nevertheless, even though the aforementioned experimentsidentify 1-IP7 as being more important for enhancing interferontranscription than IP8, the ectopic expression of IP6K1, IP6K2and IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb response significantly(Figure 4B). These results raise the possibility that, at elevatedIP6K1-3 expression levels, IP8 (and/or possibly even 5-IP7) mightInterferon Response and Inositol PyrophosphatesPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981Figure 3. Inositol pyrophosphate synthesis pathway is needed for IRF3 activation.

However,enhanced IFNb reporter activity induced by ectopic expression ofIP6K1-3 was mostly lost in the absence of expression of PPIP5K1and PPIP5K2 (Figure 4H). Thus, it is more likely that, at highlevels of expression of IP6K1-3, it is IP8 rather than 5-IP7 thatsubstitutes for the actions of 1-IP7. In this respect, it is notable thatone of the diphosphate groups on IP8 is also attached to the 1-position.To further establish the role of inositol pyrophosphates in theimmune response, we also studied a class of enzymes thatdephosphorylates inositol pyrophosphates. In humans, the hydro-lysis of short-lived inositol pyrophosphates has been attributed tothree classes of diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate phosphohydro-lase proteins (DIPPs) encoded by four genes belonging to theNudix hydrolase family [44,54,55]. These hydrolases remove theterminal phosphate from inositol pyrophosphates. If inositolpyrophosphates regulate RIG-I signaling, then removal of theirdiphosphate would inhibit the interferon response. To test thisprediction, we determined the effect of over expression of DIPP1,DIPP2a and DIPP3a on RIG-I induced IFNb promoter drivenreporter activity. In agreement with our hypothesis, cellsectopically expressing either DIPP1, DIPP2a or DIPP3a indeedshowed a significantly attenuated interferon response (Figure 4I;the rank order of efficacy of the DIPPs followed their reportedrank order of catalytic activity (DIPP1.DIPP3a.DIPP2a [54].These data also further argued that the synthesis of inositolpyrophosphates is critical for the induction of IFNb. In summary,the experiments described in this section argue that inositolpyrophosphates \u2013particularly 1-IP7 - are important for theinterferon response.1-IP7 Directly Mediates IRF3 ActivationThe data described above, obtained from experiments usinggene silencing and catalytically inactive mutants of IPPK,PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, provided strong yet indirect evidencefor the involvement of inositol pyrophosphates themselves in theinterferon response. To further test this hypothesis, we employed acell-free, virus-dependent assay for IRF3 activation. This wasdeveloped in an earlier study which reported that a purifiedmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells couldinduce IRF3 phosphorylation in a cytoplasmic fraction preparedfrom uninfected cells [56]. We reproduced these results (Figure 5A)using similar subcellular fractions (Figure S4B). It was significantthat the degree of IRF3 phosphorylation was strongly reducedwhen the cytoplasmic fraction was prepared from PPIP5K2-silenced cells (Figure 5A). Next, we reasoned that if inositolpyrophosphates were directly involved in IRF3 phosphorylation,their addition to the in vitro assay system would rescue the loss ofIRF3 activation caused by the silencing of PPIP5K2. For theseexperiments we added samples of either 1-IP7, 5-IP7 or IP8 thatwere prepared enzymatically and purified electrophoretically [57],to the cell free IRF3 phosphorylation assays. Remarkably, 5 minafter the addition of 1-IP7 in the range of its projectedphysiological concentration (0.5 uM [54]) the loss of IRF3phosphorylation that resulted from PPIP5K2 silencing was rescuedto a level that was equivalent to that in wild type cells (Figure 5B).At this time point, IP8 had no significant effect (Figure 5C).,However, IP8 was found to substitute for 1-IP7 in promoting IRF3phosphorylation, at the 10 min time point (Figure 5C,E). Theeffect of 1-IP7 on IRF3 phosphorylation is consistent with theconclusions drawn from the above described kinase silencing andectopic expression experiments. Next, we tested 5-IP7 which fromgenetic experiments (see above) was predicted not to regulate theinterferon response. Indeed, we found that 5-IP7 did not promoteIRF3 phosphorylation (Figure 5D). The observation that IP8 actedless efficiently than 1-IP7 in supporting IRF3 phosphorylation invitro, is consistent with that activity in intact cells only emerging inan over-expression paradigm (Figure 4). In the latter case, IRF3phosphorylation was stimulated upon ectopic expression of IP6Ksin a manner that was also dependent upon endogenous PPIP5Ks(Figure 4H), and hence the synthesis of IP8 (Figure 1D). Inconclusion, these cell free system based experiments considerablystrengthened our hypothesis (see above) that among the inositolpyrophosphates, it is 1-IP7 that is the more physiologically-relevant mediator of IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.Earlier studies had indicated that one mechanism by which theinositol pyrophosphates regulates signaling pathways involves thetransfer of the b-phosphoryl of their diphosphate group tophosphorylated serine residues on target proteins (termed proteinpyrophosphorylation) [58,59]. We therefore investigated whetherthe mechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in theinterferon response could be dependent on the transfer of their b-phosphate. For these experiments we used synthetic analogues of1-IP7 and IP8, in which the diphosphate was replaced with aphosphonoacetic acid (PA) ester [60]. Although the PA esterresembles a diphosphate group in several respects, its terminalphosphonate group (equivalent to the b-phosphate of a diphos-phate) cannot be transferred, due to the stability of the P-C bondit contains. Interestingly, we found that addition of the PAanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the actions ofthe natural 1-IP7 and IP8 molecules (Figure 5F, 5G). These dataare consistent with potential phosphoryl transfer underlying themechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in regulatinginterferon signaling.Inositol Pyrophosphates Synthesis Pathway is Requiredfor Cellular Antiviral ResistanceWe also investigated whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases contribute to the immune resistance of humancells to viral infection. For this, we used Sendai virus to infectHEK293 cells in which either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 wasknocked-down. In each case, the kinase knock-down led to anincreased viral load, as determined by q-RTPCR (Figure 6A).Furthermore, we also found that HEK293 cells were moreresistant to infection with influenza A virus upon over expressionof either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figures 6B and 6C).Interestingly, ectopic expression of IP6K1 also enhanced thecellular immunity to influenza A virus infection, in agreement withtheir ability to increase the interferon response upon ectopicPPIP5K2 on p(I:C) induced phosphorylation of IRF3, shown by Western blot and densitometry, respectively. A representative Western blot for eachexperiment is shown. The IFNb-luciferase values were normalized with Renilla luciferase reporter values, and expressed as fold change fromuninduced NT-si samples. Densitometry values represent measured intensities of the indicated bands from three different Western blots, shown asmean 6 SD. The significance of densitometry data was calculated by comparing the values obtained from gene silenced conditions with that ofstimulated NT-si controls. For panel A, the significance was determined by comparing the values of IFNb-luciferase activity obtained upon overexpression of RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1 in IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 gene silenced samples with that of corresponding NT-si samples. The values are mean6 SD of one representative experiment performed in triplicates. si, siRNA; NT-si, non-targeting negative control siRNA.

We further investigated whetherinterference with inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinas-es can affect viral infection dependent induction of ISG15 (a majorinterferon stimulated antiviral gene) in Sendai virus challengedHEK293 cells. As shown in Figure 6D, knock-down of eitherIPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 attenuated the induction of ISG15.This was specifically due to a defect in interferon production orindirect induction of ISG15 by IRF3, because the inositolpyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway did not show any role inexogenous IFNb induced, JAK/STAT signaling mediated ISREactivation (not shown). Furthermore, we also found that bothp(I:C) stimulation and Sendai virus infection moderately enhancedthe transcription of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 in HEK293cells (Figure 6E). In summary, these results further confirmed thatinositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases are required forinterferon mediated antiviral innate immunity.DiscussionOur manuscript provides important new information concern-ing the regulation of the interferon-mediated innate immuneresponse to infection by RNA viruses. For example, our humangenome-wide RNAi screen identified 226 novel regulators of RIG-1 mediated IFNb transcription. A particularly significant finding ofthis genomic study was the identification of the pathwaysynthesizing inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as being essential forthe interferon response. Moreover, this is the first time that aspecific function for 1-IP7 has been identified in mammalian cells,thereby opening up a new area of research in the inositolpyrophosphate field.The importance of a genome-wide, systems-biology approach tounderstanding the innate immune response was outlined in theIntroduction. Among these newly identified genes, several may be\u2018\u2018pan-regulators\u2019\u2019 of interferon induction. Indeed, our secondaryassays revealed that 36.3% of the identified genes act downstreamof TBK1, a common component of several antiviral PRRpathways. It is interesting to note that more than half (60.5%) ofthe hit genes regulated a segment of the signaling chain that islikely unique to RIG-I pathway (upstream of TBK1), and notcommon with other interferon inducing PRR pathways. Thisindicates that the regulation of the proximal steps of PRR signalingleading to interferon induction is more complex than thecommonly shared steps. Given their distinct compartmentalizedcellular localizations, it is not surprising that the PRRs undergomore intricate regulation at their proximal signaling steps, than thedownstream conserved steps.The meta-analysis demonstrated that at least 33 of the obtainedhit genes were previously reported to show transcriptional up-regulation during challenge with various immune stimuli thatactivates interferon response. However the functional relevance ofthe differential expression of these 33 genes during interferonresponse was not known previously. Our identification of thesegenes as important regulators of the interferon response demon-strates that the current systems biology based approach to studyRIG-I signaling also helps to functionally interpret genomicsstudies of host responses to infection. We further anticipate thatour data-set will facilitate future studies in this field. Given thatPRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patternsproduced by endogenous stress signals [61], it is intriguing thatinositol pyrophosphates have also been implicated in mediatingresponses to a variety of stress responses, including osmotic stress,thermal challenges and metabolic stress [43]. Our study opens uppossible new directions for identifying the mechanisms of action ofinositol pyrophosphates in combating these stresses.Our study characterized an essential regulatory role for inositolpyrophosphates in the interferon production. Although an earlierstudy had identified PPIP5K2 as an interferon inducible gene [39],inositol pyrophosphates themselves have not been shown before toplay any direct role in antiviral innate immune response.Structural analysis of PPIP5K2 [62] has revealed that it has anexquisitely specific active site that can only phosphorylate IP6 and5-IP7, to yield 1-IP7 and IP8 respectively. The in vitro reconstitutedRIG-I signaling assay using purified inositol pyrophosphatesidentified that both 1-IP7 and IP8 are capable of regulating theinterferon response. However, based on the comparative analysisof the results of experiments involving silencing of the key enzymesin this pathway along with effects of over-expression of wild-typekinases, we propose that 1-IP7 would most likely be thephysiologically-relevant regulator of IFNb transcription (amonginositol pyrophosphates).The results of the virus-dependent cell free reconstitutionassays (Figure 5) provided additional direct evidence that 1-IP7 isneeded for the functioning of TBK1-IRF3 axis leading to thephosphorylation of IRF3, a precondition for its competence tostimulate IFNb transcription. Currently it is proposed thatinositol pyrophosphates may regulate cellular pathways eitherby b-phosphoryl transfer to host proteins (protein pyropho-sphorylation), or as cofactors that may bind to target proteins[43,58,59,63\u201365]. We found that synthetic, metabolically stableanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the effects of thephysiological isomers (Figure 5), consistent with a mechanism ofaction involving phosphoryl transfer. Nevertheless, given that inearlier studies [59] all of the inositol pyrophosphates were equallycompetent at b-phosphoryl transfer to proteins, it is intriguingthat 5-IP7 did not support IRF3 phosphorylation, suggesting thatthe potential target protein may also exhibit stereo-selectivebars) or without (black bars) p(I:C)stimulation.

It is also interesting that the phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, a member of the separate inositol-lipid signalingfamily, was recently reported to stimulate IRF3 phosphorylation[66]. Thus, the distinct regulatory properties of both membrane-restricted signals (inositol lipids) and soluble, diffusible signals(inositol pyrophosphates), may converge upon the innate immuneresponse to viral invasion.Lastly, our study may seed the discovery of novel drug targetsand drugs that can be used to manipulate the interferon response,thereby improving therapy for viral infection. For example, itmight be possible to develop cell permeable small molecules thatare capable of imitating the role of 1-IP7. Conversely, inhibitors ofPPIP5Ks may find useful application to control excessiveinterferon response observed during various medical conditionsmean 6 SD.

In summary, this study providedvaluable insights into the global regulation of interferon response,and identified a novel role for inositol pyrophosphates in antiviralimmunity.Materials and MethodsRNA Interference Screen and Bioinformatics AnalysisThe RNAi screening employed a siRNA library fromDharmacon/ThermoFischer scientific (human whole genomesiGENOME siRNA Library, Cat#GU-005005-02) targeting18,164 annotated human genes was used the RNAi screening.The screen was performed in 384 well imaging compatible plates(Corning cat#3712). Briefly, 2500 HEK293 cells (in 20 ml ofDMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) were seeded in each wellhaving 50 nM siRNA complexed with 0.05 ml lipid Dharmafect1(in 20 ml of serum free DMEM) (ThermoFischer scientific). At46 hr, 40 ng RIG-I and 50 ng human IFNb-GFP reporterplasmids (in 5 ml of serum free DMEM) were transfected withFugene (Roche). At 52 hr, 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml stock of poly (I:C)complexed with the lipid Fugene (Roche) in serum free DMEMwas added to each well. At 72 hr, the cells were fixed with 3%paraformaldehyde, followed by washing with phosphate bufferedsaline and nuclear staining with DAPI. Using high contentfluorescence microscopy (ImageXpress Micro, Molecular DevicesCorporation), images of each well was captured at 46 magnifi-cation. The number of cells, and number of GFP positive cellswere determined by algorithm-driven data analysis using theMetaXpress software (Version 3, Molecular Devices Corporation).Any gene silencing that reduced cell number by greater thanapproximately 50% was eliminated for potential toxicity. siRNAstargeting IRF3 and MAVS were used as positive controls, and anon-targeting (NT) siRNA served as the negative control.The bioinformatics analysis of the siRNA screen was facilitatedby the RNAither package of Bioconductor in R [67]. The screenwas performed in duplicate. The mean percent GFP-positive cellswas calculated for each gene (the screen was performed induplicate), and then a Z-score normalization was performed bysubtracting the median of the plate and dividing by the medianabsolute deviation per plate.Gene ontology enrichment analysis and network analysis wasconducted on the 226 novel regulators that were identified in thesecondary siRNA screen using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)software.Gene Expression Meta-AnalysisGene expression datasets were accessed from the NCBI GeneExpression Omnibus in series matrix file format from five previousstudies [21,37\u201340]. Raw expression values were log2-transformed.Two-group comparisons were made between sample sets usingStudent\u2019s t-test followed by the false-discovery rate (FDR) methodto correct for multiple hypothesis testing, setting the cut-off atFDR,0.05. Significantly differentially expressed genes from eachstudy were then queried against the list of 226 genes identifiedfrom the RNAi screen.Reporter AssaysThe reporter assays were performed as previously reported[9,42]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with expressionplasmids of human PRRs (RIG-I or TLR3 or MDA5), humanIFNa4 promoter, or human IFNb promoter or NFkB-targetpromoter driven luciferase reporters (pGL2 vector, Promega) anda constitutively transcribed Renilla luciferase reporter (p-RL-TK,Promega) for 24 hr. Cells were then either directly assayed forluciferase activity, or were stimulated with poly (I:C) by eithertransfecting (500 ng/ml for RIG-I assay) or by adding to themedium (20 mg/ml for TLR3) for additional 18 hr, and luciferasereading was performed using Dual-Glo assay kit (Promega). Forectopic expression assays, HEK293 cells grown overnight weretransfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 hr with or withoutRIG-I and poly (I:C), and luciferase assays were performed.Values were normalized to that of Renilla luciferase internalcontrol.Viral Infection and Viral Load DeterminationHEK293 cells or primary macrophages were infected withSendai virus (Cantell strain, Charles River Laboratories) at 30\u201380HA units for 18 hr, and processed for q-RTPCR. A geneticallymodified Influenza A virus (IAV) (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) withgreen fluorescent protein insertion was propagated in MDCK cellsand used for the studies [68]. The HEK293 cells were infectedwith IAV at an MOI of 2 for 12 hr, fixed and microscopy wasperformed.IRF3 Phosphorylation, Dimerization and NuclearMigration AssaysThe IRF3 activity was determined using previously reportedprotocols [42,69,70]. Detection of IRF3 phosphorylation: Over-night grown 56105 HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfectedwith 500 ng of RIG-I for 24 hr, and stimulated with 4 mg of poly(I:C) for 4 hr. The clarified cell lysate in RIPA buffer (50 mMTrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1%SDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) (pooled from three wells,for each condition) were separated by Sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and probed withanti-pIRF3 (Serine 396) and anti-IRF3 antibodies. For the detectionof IRF3 dimers, after 4 hr stimulation, the cells were lysed in mildcold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTAand 1% NP-40), and the protein was separated on native acrylamidegel, with 1% sodium deoxycholate in the cathode buffer. The IRF3dimer was visualized by Western blot. For the detection of IRF3nuclear migration by Western blot, after 4 hr stimulation, nucleiwere isolated using Nuclear extraction Kit (Activemotif), andcytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGEand detected by Western blot. For the Western blot, the proteinswere transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes using Transblot(Biorad), and detected by immuno-detection with appropriateprimary antibodies. The transferred proteins of interest werevisualized using Licor infrared imaging system, with IRDye800CW and 680RD as secondary antibodies (Licor).In Vitro Reconstituted IRF3 Phosphorylation AssayThis assay was performed as reported earlier [56]. Briefly,cytoplasm from uninfected cells was incubated with isolatedmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells at 30uC,and pIRF3/IRF3 were detected by Western blot (visualized usingHRP conjugated secondary antibody) at different time points. Theassay buffer was 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 2 mM ATP,5 mM MgCl2, and 0.25 M D-mannitol.Synthesis and Purification of 1-IP7, 5-IP7 and IP8The methodology was reported previously [57]. The inositolpyrophosphates were prepared enzymatically, using 1.2 mMInsP6 as starting substrate. The synthesis of 1-InsP7, 5-InsP7and InsP8 were carried out by incubating (at 37uC) IP6 withrespectively 0.12 mg/ml PPIP5K2KD for 22.5 h, 0.17 mg/mlIP6K1 for 3 h or 0.17 mg/ml IP6K1 and 0.11 mg/mlInterferon Response and Inositol PyrophosphatesPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981PPIP5K2KD together for 3 h. The reaction buffer compositionwas 20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgSO4, 1 mMDTT, 6 mM phosphocreatine, 24 unit/ml creatine kinase and5 mM ATP disodium salt. The reactions were quenched andneutralized with, respectively, 0.2 volumes 2 M HClO4 and 0.34volumes 1 M K2CO3, 40 mM EDTA or placed at 100uC for 3\u20135 min. The synthesized inositol pyrophosphates were purifiedusing a previously reporter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based method that was modified for scale up [71]. The inositolpyrophosphates were detected by staining with Toluidine Blue[71], and quantified through mass assay of the releasedorthophosphate upon complete hydrolysis by wet-ashing at120uC for 48 h [72]. The phosphonoacetic acid (PA) analoguesof 1-IP7 and IP8 were chemically synthesized using a similarstrategy to that previously reported for 5-IP7 [60]. The IP8analogue was used as a racemic mixture, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of 1,5-[PA]2-IP4 and 3,5-[PA]2-IP4.Gene Accession Numbers (NCBI)IPPK, NM_022755, PPIP5K2, NM_015216; PPIP5K1,NM_014659; IP6K1, NM_001006115; IP6K2, NM_001005911;IP6K3, NM_054111.StatisticsData are expressed as mean 6 SD of one representativeexperiment performed in triplicates. Statistical significance ofdifferences in mean values was analyzed using unpaired two-tailedStudent\u2019s t-tests; and p-values,0.05 were be considered statisti-cally significant. *p,0.05; **p,0.01.Additional descriptions of the general reagents, experimentalprocedures, siRNA and DNA primer sequences that were used inthe study are provided in Supplementary Methods S1.Supporting InformationFigure S1 IFNb promoter driven GFP-based reporterassay validation. (A) HEK293 cells were transfected withindicated combinations of poly (I:C), IFNb promoter-GFPreporter plasmid or RIG-I, and the percentage of GFP positivecell were quantified at 24 h, using microscopy. Significance isexpressed by comparing to the values obtained from NO RIG-I,NO p(I:C) samples. (B) The IFNb promoter-GFP reporter assayspecifically represents RIG-I mediated signaling. The reporterassay was performed after silencing the indicated genes. Signifi-cance is expressed by comparing to the values obtained from NT-si samples. The percentage GFP positive cell values shown valuesare mean 6 SD of one representative experiment performed intriplicates.(PDF)Figure S2 Statistical and bioinformatics analysis of thesiRNA screen. (A) The distribution of percent GFP-positive cellsis plotted for the experimental data (grey), negative controls (red),and positive controls (green). (B and 2C) Q-Q plots on percentGFP-positive cells (B) and Z-score normalized values (C) support anormal distribution. Red dots indicate negative controls and greendots indicate positive controls. (D) The Z-score distribution isshown with a green line indicating the cut-off for a putativepositive regulator of RIG-I (22.5) and a red line for a putativenegative regulator (+2.5).(PDF)Figure S3 Validation of the role of PPIP5Ks and IP6Ksin RIG-I signaling. (A) The defect in interferon response defectcaused by silencing of the indicated genes using their 39-UTRtargeting siRNAs was rescued by complementing with corre-sponding cDNAs. (B) siRNA treatment reduces PPIP5K1 andPPIP5K2 transcript levels, in HEK293 cells. The mRNA levels areexpressed as fold-change, calculated using the formula 2 - (Ct ofkinase gene - Ct of b-actin), with untreated value as 1. (C) Effect ofsilencing of IPPK and PPIP5Ks on basal IFNb and IFNa-promoterdriven firefly luciferase reporter activity in HEK293 cells withoutRIG-I ectopic expression and p(I:C) stimulation. Data is providedas firefly luciferase reporter activity normalized with constitutivelyactive Renilla luciferase activity. (D) Effect of silencing of IPPKand PPIP5Ks on basal IFNb transcription in HEK293 cellswithout RIG-I ectopic expression and p(I:C) stimulation, mea-sured by q-RTPCR. The mRNA level data are expressed as fold-change, determined using the comparative Ct value basedapproach, using the formula 22 (Ct of kinase gene - Ct of b-actin),with NT-si treated value as 1. (E) Interferon response attenuationupon kinase knockdown is independent of autocrine amplificationof RIG-I pathway genes. JAK1 was silenced to attenuatedownstream signaling pathways leading to autocrine amplification,and IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 were simultaneously silenced,followed by determining RIG-I driven IFNb promoter-Luciferasereporter activity. (F) Genetic deletion of IP6K1 does not affectIFNb promoter-Luciferase reporter activity in poly (I:C) stimulat-ed mouse embryonic fibroblasts. (G) Treatment HEK293 cellswith IP6Ks inhibitor TNP does not affect RIG-I driven IFNbpromoter-Luciferase reporter activity. The IFNb-luciferase valueswere normalized with Renilla luciferase reporter values, andexpressed as fold change from uninduced NT-si samples. Thesignificance is determined by comparing the values for each genewith that of corresponding NT-si samples. The values are mean 6SD of one representative experiment performed in triplicates.(PDF)Figure S4 (A) Silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2does not cause toxicity.
