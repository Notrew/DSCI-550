Cruikshank b, Rujuan Dai aa Department of Neurology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 421 East Canfield, 2226 Elliman Building, Detroit, MI 48201, USAb Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USAReceived 21 June 2005; revised 21 June 2005; accepted 7 September 2005AbstractExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a CD4C T-cell mediated disease, which resembles immunopathology of multiplesclerosis (MS). Interleukin (IL)-16 is a CD4C cell-specific chemoattractant cytokine. In CD4C T cells, production of bioactive IL-16 fromconstitutive pro-IL-16 requires cleavage by active caspase-3. We reported reversal of established relapsing disease by IL-16 neutralization.To better understand role(s) of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing EAE, we comparatively analyzed levels of IL-16, active caspase-3 and CD4in mice with severe relapsing-remitting [(B6! SJL) F1], and low-relapsing (B6), disease. Elevated levels of IL-16 along with an increasein active-caspase-3 and CD4 levels correlated with stages of clinically active disease in both strains. CNS levels of bioactive IL-16 were notablyhigher in F1 compared to B6 mice at all stages, being most prominent during relapse. Similar patterns of regulation for IL-16 and active caspase-3 were observed in peripheral lymphoid organs, and in T cells isolated from lymph nodes following T-cell activation in vitro. IL-16 was co-immunoprecipitated with CD4 from CNS of relapsing mice. Our data suggest that caspase-3 mediated production of IL-16 by infiltratingCD4C T cells, contributes to ongoing neuroinflammation by chemoattraction of additional waves of CD4C T cells.\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is anautoimmune CD4C Th1 mediated disease. EAE serves asa model for human autoimmune demyelinating disease multi-ple sclerosis (MS) [1,2]. By producing and locally secretingTh1-type cytokines, such as interleukin-2, interferon (IFN)-g, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, encephalitogenicCD4C T cells induce activation of neighboring astrocytesand microglia, which then in turn produce more inflamma-tory cytokines and chemokines [3e5]. In addition to cytokineproduction and stimulation of glial cells, infiltrating T cellsdirectly contribute to local chemokine accumulation [6e8].Production and local accumulation of chemokines within the* Corresponding author.

Findings of elevated levels of several CC and CXCchemokines in CNS in correlation with stages of clinicallyactive disease suggested their role in regulation of inflammatorycell trafficking into CNS [10,11]. This hypothesis was furthersupported by later experiments, showing complete or partial re-sistance to EAE induction in either chemokine or chemokine-specific receptor deficient mice [12e14].We have recently demonstrated that another chemoattractantfactor, a cytokine interleukin-16 (IL-16), has been associatedwith the pathology of relapsing-remitting EAE [15]. Asopposed to the majority of CC and CXC chemokines implicatedin the immunopathology of EAE, which do not discriminate be-tween cell phenotypes, IL-16 is a CD4C T-cell-specific chemo-attractant cytokine. IL-16 is a more effective chemoattractantfor Th1 than for Th2 CD4C T cells [16]. Cytokine IL-16 hasmailto:skundric@cmb.biosci.wayne.eduhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411207D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214been identified as a major source of T-cell chemotactic activityand was originally named leukocyte chemoattractant factor(LCF) [17]. In addition to chemoattraction of CD4C cells,IL-16 exerts proinflammatory and immunomodulatory proper-ties, which include regulation of CD4C T-cell activation, andregulation of chemokine induced chemoattraction [18].The precursor molecule, pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) is constitutivelyproduced in T lymphocytes. Activation and release of bioactiveIL-16 (17 kDa) is distinctly regulated among T-cell subsets. InCD4C T cells, T-cell receptor (TCR) mediated or cytokine-induced T-cell activation, leads to the enzymatic cleavageof pro-IL-16 by activated caspase-3 and release of activeC-terminal portion of IL-16 (14e17 kDa), while secretion ofIL-16 from CD8C T cells is caspase-3 independent [18].It has been suggested that C-terminal cleavage of pro-IL-16 isregulated by phosphorylation of pro-IL-16 on Ser144, whichengages Erk1/2 kinase activity, while the secretion of bioactiveIL-16 is regulated by MAP kinase [19]. While in quiescentCD4C T cells only pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) can be detected,upon cell activation, an intermediate product of cleavage(50e60 kDa) and active IL-16 (14e17 kDa) are readily obser-ved. Secreted IL-16 multimerizes into homotetramers com-posed of 14e17 kDa chains, necessary for the binding to CD4receptor and subsequent signaling. Bioactive IL-16 induces che-moattraction of CD4C T cells by binding to CD4 receptor andsignaling that involves p56lck, protein kinase C,with the require-ment for SH2/SH3 recruitment domains, which suggest involve-ment of other intracellular signaling proteins [20]. While thesecreted C-terminal domain of IL-16 achieves its pleiotropiceffects on CD4C cells through CD4-initiated signaling path-ways, the residual N-terminal domain translocate to the nucleus,where it induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Nuclear translocationof N-terminal portion of IL-16 is enabled by the CcN motif,which contains nuclear localization sequence (NLS), proteinkinase CK2 substrate site and a cdc2 kinase substrate site [21].Increased local production of IL-16 has been reported inother CD4C Th1 mediated autoimmune diseases, such asrheumatoid arthritis and Graves\u2019 disease [22,23]. In CNS of(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice with relapsing-remitting EAE, we ob-served IL-16 immunoreactivity confined to CD4C, CD8CT cells and B cells. Our data suggest that IL-16 play an impor-tant role in regulation of relapsing EAE in (B6 ! SJL) F1(H-2b/s) mice, as anti-IL-16 therapy improved clinical andhistopathology of relapsing disease [15].In the present study, we examined and compared mecha-nisms of IL-16 regulation between relapsing-remitting andnon/low-relapsing EAE mice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mice and induction of EAEEAE was induced in 8e10-week-old C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2b)and (B6 ! SJL) F1 (H-2b/s) female mice (Jackson Laborato-ries, Bar Harbor, ME) by immunization with MOG35e55(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK), 99% pure by HPLC,(Caltech, Pasadena, CA), as previously described [8]. Micewere observed daily for clinical symptoms of EAE. The clin-ical grade was scored as follows: 0.5, partial loss of tail tonic-ity; 1, complete loss of tail tonicity; 2, flaccid tail andabnormal gait; 3, hind leg paralysis; 4, hind leg paralysiswith hind body paresis; 5, hind and foreleg paralysis, 6,moribund.2.2. Tissue samplingMice were killed at different stages of relapsing-remittingdisease: acute, remission, relapse and chronic. Approximately3e4 mice from each strain were analyzed at each stage of dis-ease. Mice were anesthetized, perfused through the heart with10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and spinalcord, brain, spleen and regional lymph nodes were dissected.From each dissected tissue, 1e2-mm blocks were cut and em-bedded in Tissue Compound (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The re-maining tissues were snap-frozen for protein isolation. Frozenblocks and tissue samples were kept at \ufffd70 \ufffdC until analyzed.2.3. AntibodiesFor immunostaining, Western blot and immunoprecipita-tion, primary antibodies against: human IL-16 unconjugatedand R-Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated (clone 14.1) (1:200),and mouse CD-4 (rat IgG2a,kdclone RM4-5) (BD Pharmin-gen, San Diego, CA); human/mouse active Caspase-3(1:200), (R&D Systems); p85 fragment of polyADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) (Promega, Madison, WI), and glyceralde-hyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Santa Cruz),were used. Isotype matched control antibody used for immu-noprecipitation as a control for CD4-specific antibody waspurified rat IgG2a, k (clone R35-95, BD Pharmingen).2.4. Western blotProtein was isolated from fresh frozen spinal cord, spleenand lymph node tissues using TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL,Grand Island, NY) according to the procedure recommendedby the manufacturer. Equal amounts of protein (approximately20 mg/lane) from each sample were loaded per lane for West-ern blot analysis. Samples were loaded at nonreducing condi-tions onto NuPage Novex Tris-Acetate gels (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA), resolved by electrophoresis. Electrophoresedproteins were then transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulosemembrane. Membrane was cut into 3e4 strips, each contain-ing proteins of different molecular weight. Each membranestrip was probed separately with the appropriate primary anti-body overnight at 4 \ufffdC, washed three times with 0.1% Tween20eTris-buffered saline, and than incubated with peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody. The membrane bound peroxi-dase activity was detected by using ECL Plus Western blottingdetection kits (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Chemilu-minescent images were captured and analyzed by a KodakDigital Science Image Station 440CF. All blots were studied208 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214within the linear range of exposure. In each sample levels ofIL-16, active caspase-3 and CD4 were normalized by corre-sponding levels of GAPDH.2.5. ImmunoprecipitationCD4 protein was immunoprecipitated from total proteinsisolated from spinal cord of EAE mice using a Seize PrimaryImmunoprecipitation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), following themanufacturer\u2019s procedure. Immunoprecipitation with controlantibody was done similarly in a separate experiment. CD4and control immunoprecipitates were then subjected to West-ern blot analysis.2.6. Immunostaining and confocal microscopySimilarly prepared 6-mm frozen sections were used to ana-lyze phenotypes of infiltrating cells by immunofluorescence,following a routine procedure [8]. Briefly, sections were air-dried, acetone-fixed, treated with 10% normal donkey serumfor 10 min, followed by overnight incubation with relevant pri-mary antibody in a moist chamber at C4 \ufffdC. The slides werethen washed and incubated with secondary fluorochrome-labeled antibodies for 30 min. DAPI staining was performedfor 5 min after immunostaining was completed. After wash-ing, the slides were mounted in Gelmount (Biomeda, FosterCity, CA) and analyzed by light and fluorescent microscopy.Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 600 epifluorescentmicroscope with a Princeton Instruments Micromax 5 MHzcooled CCD camera.2.7. In vitro T-cell stimulationFrom anesthetized (B6 ! SJL) F1 (3 relapsing and 2 withchronic disease) and B6 (2 relapsing) mice, spleens weredissected and cells were prepared for in vitro experiments.Splenic and lymph node isolated T cells (5! 105/well) werestimulated with 25 mg/ml of MOG35e55 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma,St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 1% normal mouse serum.Cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom plates for 72 hand incubated at 37 \ufffdC in humidified air containing 5%CO2. Following in vitro activation, approximately 5 ! 106cells (12 wells) were treated with Brefeldin A (10 mg/ml)(Sigma), prior to collection and protein isolation. Proteinsfrom stimulated T cells were then analyzed by Western blot.From control (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice, splenic T cells weresimilarly isolated and stimulated with PHA (10 mg/ml) for72 h in vitro. Proteins were isolated from cells at the end ofculture period, and subjected to Western blot analysis.2.8. Statistical analysisThe significance of differences between groups was calcu-lated by Student\u2019s t-test or paired-test as appropriate. The levelof statistical significance was set at 95%.3. Results3.1. Increased CNS levels of bioactive IL-16 duringclinically active disease correspond to elevation ofactive-caspase-3 and CD4C T-cell infiltrationThe levels of bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) in spinal cord fromrelapsing-remitting (B6 ! SJL) F1, and low/relapsing (B6)mice are shown in Fig. 1. Compared to control levels, whichwere indistinguishable between the two strains of mice, wefound markedly higher upregulation of bioactive IL-16, duringstages of active disease, in F1 than in B6 mice. Levels of IL-16were significantly elevated during acute, relapsing and chronicstages of the disease. At each stage of disease, comparison wasmade between F1 and B6 mice with similar disease severityscores (differences not grater than one grade on a 0e6 scale).Levels of bioactive IL-16 were markedly higher in mice withacute EAE compared to control levels. Bioactive IL-16 peakedat relapsing, slightly decreased at chronic, but still remainedsignificantly higher compared to controls in (B6 ! SJL) F1mice. B6 mice with chronic disease were not examinedbecause the majority of these mice recovered either followingdisease onset or relapse, similar to previous data [8]. In low-relapsing, B6 mice, levels of bioactive IL-16 were increasedbut not significantly different between acute and relapsingdisease (Fig. 1a,b). Although differences in levels of bioactiveIL-16 were significant at acute ( p ! 0.05), strikingly differentlevels of bioactive IL-16 were observed during relapsing dis-ease between F1 and B6 mice. Relapsing F1 mice had approx-imately fourfold higher levels of bioactive IL-16 in CNScompared to relapsing B6 mice ( p ! 0.001). During remis-sion, levels of bioactive IL-16 returned close to control valuesin both strains of mice. In parallel with the increase in levels ofbioactive IL-16, an elevation of active caspase-3 in spinal cordof mice with relapsing EAE was observed. Upregulation ofactive-caspase-3 followed trend similar to bioactive IL-16throughout the course of relapsing EAE. Differences in thelevels of active caspase-3 between the F1 and B6 mice wereconsistent with those found for bioactive IL-16 (Fig. 1a,c).Relative levels of bioactive IL-16 were approximately three-to fourfold higher compared to relative levels of activecaspase-3, during acute and relapsing EAE (Fig. 1b,c). Eleva-tion of active caspase-3 was not followed by elevation ofcleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (not shown),suggesting an apoptosis-unrelated role for active caspase-3in CNS of EAE mice. Active caspase-3 is important for the en-zymatic cleavage of bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) from pro-IL16(80 kDa) in activated CD4C T cells.Previously, we observed that infiltrating CD4C T cellscontained IL-16 in spinal cord of (B6 ! SJL) F1 EAE mice[15]. Our data from semiquantitative analysis of immunos-tained spinal cord sections suggested more extensive infiltra-tion by CD4C T cells during the acute and especiallyrelapsing disease in (B6 ! SJL) F1 then B6 mice [8]. Inthis experiment we measured levels of CD4 from total proteinsisolated from spinal cord by Western blot (Fig. 2). Regulationof CD4 levels paralleled those of bioactive IL-16 and active209D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214Fig. 1. Similar patterns of regulation between bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) and active caspase-3 are observed in CNS of (B6 ! SJL) F1 and B6 mice throughout thecourse of relapsing disease. (a) Levels of bioactive IL-16 and active caspase-3 from total proteins isolated from spinal cord of EAE mice were analyzed by Westernblot. Compared to low constitutive expression, marked upregulation in levels of both proteins was observed during acute, relapsing and chronic stages of disease inboth strains of mice. (b) Production of bioactive IL-16 was consistently higher in F1 compared to B6 mice. (c) Levels of active caspase-3, similarly to bioactive IL-16, were markedly higher in F1 compared to B6 mice. Approximately 20 mg of total protein was loaded per lane. From each stage of the disease of each mousestrain total of 3e4 mice were analyzed. Representative blot shows: acute-F1 (12 dpi, grade 4.5), B6 (20 dpi, grade 5); remission-F1 (28 dpi, grade 1), B6 (23 dpi,grade 0.5); relapse-F1 (68 dpi, grade 4, 3rd relapse), B6 (23 dpi, grade 4, 1st relapse); and chronic-F1 (70 dpi, grade 3); B6 (30 dpi, grade 4). Data for CD4, IL-16(80 and 55 kDa) from these samples are shown in Figs. 2, 6 and 7.Fig. 2. Levels of CD4 protein in CNS of (B6 ! SJL) F1 and B6 mice were measured by Western blot. Similar patterns of regulation between levels of CD4 andproduction of bioactive IL-16 and active caspase-3 (Fig. 1) were observed. Markedly higher levels of CD4 were found in F1 then in B6 mice.210 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214caspase-3 in CNS of relapsing mice. Levels of CD4 werehigher in (B6 ! SJL) F1 than in B6 mice, which was consis-tent with our previous report. We than preceded to investigatewhether infiltrating CD4C T cells produce bioactive IL-16 inthe CNS of EAE mice. Because of the lack of antibody thatwould distinguish between the pro-IL-16, which is constitu-tively present in CD4C T cells, and bioactive IL-16, whichis cleaved from pro-molecule by active caspase-3 upon cellactivation, we analyzed spinal cord sections by two-color im-munostaining and confocal microscopy. The colocalization ofIL-16 with active caspase-3 in infiltrating cells in spinal cordof relapsing EAE mouse is shown in Fig. 3. Active caspse-3was observed in most IL-16-containing infiltrating mononu-clear cells (Fig. 3, arrows) but also in neighboring cells withinthe CNS. While the majority of IL-16 immunoreactiveinfiltrating cells contained active caspase-3, only a few cellswithout apparent colocalization between IL-16 and activecaspase-3 were observed (Fig. 3, arrowheads).3.2. Splenic and lymph node T cells from EAEmice produce IL-16 in vitroOverall, data from analysis of IL-16, active caspase-3 andCD4 regulation, and colocalization in CNS of relapsing-remitting and low-relapsing strains of mice suggested thatbioactive IL-16 could be produced locally by infiltratingCD4C T cells. Moreover, our results implied that its productioncould be important for regulation of acute and especially relaps-ing and chronic stages of disease. To explore the further potentialof CD4C T cells to produce bioactive IL-16 in EAE, we ana-lyzed peripheral lymphoid organs, spleen and inguinal lymphnodes. We expected to find evidence for activation of IL-16 inregional lymph nodes and spleen of EAE mice, as a result ofCD4C T-cell activation by immunization with MOG35e55 incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. Of especial interest to us was to in-vestigatewhether activation of IL-16 occurs at later stages of dis-ease, relapse and chronic disease. High levels of bioactive IL-16(17 kDa) and IL-16 (55 kDa) were found in inguinal lymphnodes and spleen of both strains of mice with either relapsingor chronic disease. Similarly as observed in CNS, levels of activecaspase-3 corresponded to levels of bioactive IL-16 in peripherallymphoid organs (Fig. 4). Distinctly from CNS, in the peripherymarked differences between F1 and B6 strains in levels of bioac-tive IL-16 and active caspase-3 were not observed.3.3. Levels of IL-16 in T cells following either polyclonalactivation, or restimulation with cognate antigen in vitroIn addition to analyzing IL-16 protein in intact peripherallymphoid organs, we isolated T cells from lymph nodes andFig. 3. Colocalization between IL-16 and active-caspase-3 in infiltrating mononuclear cells in spinal cord was analyzed by confocal microscopy on two-colorimmunostained spinal cord frozen sections. A representative image shows dorsal column of lumbar spinal cord from F1 mouse at fourth EAE relapse, 83 dpi,with clinical grade of 2. Note in upper panel, IL-16C mononuclear cells in submeningeal spaces and along the penetrating blood vessel (at arrows), active cas-pase-3 (arrows) and their colocalization (merge, arrows). Detail of merge image is shown in lower panel. Colocalized IL-16 and active caspse-3 were observed inmost of IL-16C infiltrating cells (arrows). Active caspase-3 was also observed in the neighboring cells, which did not contain IL-16. Few IL-16C cells did notshow active capse-3 immunostaining (arrowheads). Two-color immunostaining ! 40 and ! 200.211D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214spleens from mice immunized with MOG35e55, and restimu-lated cells with antigen in vitro. Control cells isolated fromspleen of non-immunizedmice and polyclonally activated na\u0131\u0308vesplenocytes were analyzed, and IL-16 activation was compared(Fig. 5). In control splenocytes, IL-16was not observed at appre-ciable levels. Following 72 h activation with PHA, both bandsindicating activation of IL-16, the 55 kDa and 17 kDa, wereobserved. Similarly, 72 h restimulation with MOG35e55 ofeither splenic or lymph node isolated T cells from immunizedmice resulted in activation of IL-16. Active caspase-3 was notobserved at times optimal for bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) andIL-16 (55 kDa) production (not shown). It is likely that cleavageof caspase-3, its intracellular accumulation and later degrada-tion of the active caspase-3 fragment is regulated differentlythan cleavage of bioactive IL-16.3.4. Levels of IL-16 (55 kDa) are higher during activestages of disease in both strains of miceWe also found elevated levels of IL-16 (55 kDa), which isbelieved to be an intermediate product of pro-IL-16 cleavage.Fig. 4. Levels of IL-16 (17 and 55 kDa) and active caspase-3 in spleen andlymph node of relapsing mice were analyzed by Western blot. Note markedupregulation of IL-16 (55 kDa) and bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) during relapsingand chronic stages. Active caspase-3 was elevated correspondingly. Represen-tative samples from 3e4 similar experiments show: relapse (F1: 36 dpi, grade3; B6: 21 dpi, grade 2); chronic (F1: 70 dpi, grade 4; B6: 25 dpi, grade 1).Fig. 5. Production of bioactive IL-16 (55 and 17 kDa) was observed in activat-ed T cells, isolated from mice immunized with MOG35e55. Ten days after im-munization isolated T cells were in vitro restimulated with MOG35e55 (50 mg/ml) for 72 h. In a different experiment, T cells isolated from na\u0131\u0308ve controlmice were activated with PHA (10 mg/ml) for 72 h. For either restimulationwith MOG35e55 or polyclonal activation, approximately 5 ! 106cells werestimulated/well in a 96-well plate. Following stimulation cells were collected,and total proteins were isolated and analyzed by Western blot. Representativeblot from two similar experiments shows production of IL-16 17 kDa, and55 kDa, following T-cell activation, compared to control unstimulated T cellsisolated from spleen of na\u0131\u0308ve mice.In spinal cord of mice with EAE, IL-16 (55 kDa) was the mostprominent compared to pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) (Figs. 6 and 7) andbioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) (Fig. 1). Similar temporal regulationof all three forms of IL-16 in CNS of EAE mice was observed.Throughout the course of relapsing EAE in both strains ofmice, IL-16 proteins of 80, 55 and 17 kDa were upregulatedduring clinically active disease (acute, relapse and chronic).At each examined stage of the disease, F1 and B6 mice withsimilar day post immunization (dpi) clinical grade and dura-tion of symptoms were compared. Generally, B6 mice had de-layed onset of EAE compared to F1 mice (15 vs. 9), and lowermean severity scores at onset (3C- vs. 4C-), similar to find-ings we reported previously [8]. In order to assure fair compar-ison between two strains of mice, which distinctly regulatetheir immune responses to MOG35e55, the priority was givento similarities in clinical scores, which reflected severity ofdisease, rather than the day of onset. Mice with severity scoresdifferent more than one grade on the scale of 1e6 were notcompared. At acute and relapsing stages a correlation betweenlevels of IL-16 and severity was not observed.Temporal regulation of the levels of pro-IL-16 in CNS ofEAE mice followed similar patterns as observed for activatedIL-16 55 kDa fragment and bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa). In-creased levels of pro-IL-16 were observed in acute, relapsingand chronic disease stages. Distinct to levels of activated frag-ments (55 and 17 kDa), which were highly elevated at acuteand relapsing disease, levels of pro-IL-16 were markedly in-creased during relapsing and chronic compared to acute dis-ease. Strain differences in levels of pro-IL-16 were observedand were consistent with those described for IL-16 55 and17 kDa (see Fig. 1). Overall, (B6 ! SJL) F1 strain containedmore pro-IL-16, and produced more activated 55 kDa andbioactive (17 kDa) IL-16 throughout the course of relapsingdisease compared to B6 strain.3.5. IL-16 co-immunoprecipitates with CD4Our data suggest that infiltrating CD4C T cells could pro-duce bioactive IL-16 and subsequently release it locally. Theimportance of such production is linked to the major biologicalfunction of bioactive IL-16, which is CD4C T-cell chemoat-traction. IL-16 binds to CD4 molecule in a ligand-receptor spe-cific fashion. IL-16 initiated signaling through CD inducesspecific chemotaxis of CD4C T cells. By co-immunoprecipita-tion experiments, we investigated whether IL-16 and CD4 arefunctionally related in the CNS of EAE mice. Co-immunopre-cipitation of CD4 and IL-16 is shown in Fig. 8. Total proteinswere isolated from spinal cord of a (B6 ! SJL) F1 mouse atthird relapse, 68 dpi, with clinical severity score of 4. In twoseparate experiments, immunoprecipitation was done withanti-CD4 and an isotype-matched control antibody. Immuno-precipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis andblotted onto the membrane. Membranes were probed withanti-IL-16 antibody, then stripped and probed with anti-CD4antibody. A strong anti-IL-16 specific band corresponding to17 kDa fragments, a less intense band corresponding to50 kDa fragment and a faint band of approximately 62 kDa212 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214Fig. 6. Regulation of IL-16 (55 kDa) in spinal cord of F1 and B6 mice, with relapsing disease was similar to those of bioactive IL-16 (Fig. 1) and pro-IL-16 (Fig. 7).Elevated levels of IL-16 (55 kDa) during acute, relapse and chronic disease, compared to control were observed in both relapsing-remitting (F1) and low-relapsing(B6) mice. Upregulation of IL-16 was markedly higher in F1 compared to B6 mice, with similar disease.were observed in CD4 immunoprecipitated proteins. NoIL-16 or CD4 specific reactivity was evident in immunopre-cipitates with the control antibody. Anti-CD4 antibody con-firmed presence of CD4 of approximately 50 kDa in CD4immunoprecipitates.4. DiscussionPrevious work from our laboratory has suggested an impor-tant role of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing disease in(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice [15]. To better understand the role ofIL-16 in orchestrating inflammation of the central nervous sys-tem (CNS), we extended our previous observations and soughtanswers to several questions relevant for the regulation of bio-active IL-16 in relapsing EAE. To test our hypothesis that IL-16has a role in regulation of relapsing disease, we examined andcompared regulation of IL-16 between two genetically distinctstrains of mice, (B6 ! SJL) F1 and the parental B6. Followingimmunization with MOG35e55 (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice developsevere relapsing-remitting while B6 mice develop low-relaps-ing disease. In addition these two strains exhibit distinct histo-pathology of CNS lesions and distinct regulation of their T-cellresponses to MOG35e55 [8]. Our data showmajor differences inlevels of IL-16 produced in CNS between these two strains ofmice. In CNS of F1 mice, which consistently develop severe,relapsing-remitting disease, levels of bioactive IL-16 weremarkedly higher compared to the low-relapsing B6 strain.Fig. 7. Levels of pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) in CNS of EAE mice were analyzed byWestern blot. Note upregulation of pro-IL-16 during acute, relapsing andchronic EAE, similarly as observed for IL-16 (55 kDa) (Fig. 6), and bioactiveIL-16 (17 kDa) (Fig. 1).Elevation of bioactive IL-16 during acute, relapse and chronic,and its clearance from CNS during remission, may suggest itsparticipation in mechanisms of inflammation, which accompa-ny stages of clinically manifested disease. Markedly higher lev-els of bioactive IL-16 during relapse as compared to acute andits persistence in chronic disease further underscored the possi-bility that IL-16-mediated mechanisms might be of greater im-portance in the regulation of chronic inflammation in CNS, inthe relapsing-remitting F1 strain. Throughout the course of re-lapsing-remitting EAE, temporal regulation of IL-16 verymuchresembles that reported for several chemokines, which are crit-ically involved in regulation of CNS inflammation, such asMCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and others [24]. While the role ofchemokines in the orchestration of the initial CNSFig. 8. IL-16 co-immunoprecipitated with CD4 in CNS from mice with relaps-ing disease. CD4 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CD4 specific anti-body, from total proteins isolated from spinal cord and subjected to Westernblotting using anti-IL-16 antibody. The membrane was then stripped and re-blotted with anti-CD4 antibody. In a separate, similarly performed experiment,immunoprecipitation was done with control antibody, which was isotype-matched with anti-CD4 specific antibody. IL-16 specific immunoreactivitywas not observed with control immunoprecipitates. Blot shows results fromspinal cord of (B6 ! SJL) F1 mouse, at third relapse, 68 dpi, with clinicalgrade of 4.213D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214inflammation and onset of disease has been clearly established,our data imply that bioactive IL-16 may be more important inregulating relapsing and chronic stages of disease.Bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) represents secreted C-terminalportion of a larger precursor molecule, pro-IL-16 (80 kDa).By specifically binding and signaling through CD4, bioactiveIL-16 induces chemoattraction of CD4C cells. The minimalC-terminal peptide RRKS (corresponding to Arg106 to Ser109)was shown to be critical for mediating chemoattracting activityof mature IL-16 [25]. Active caspase-3 is essential for the cleav-age of bioactive IL-16 in activated CD4C T cells [18]. To in-vestigate whether CD4C infiltrating T cells may locallyproduce IL-16, we proceeded to determine levels and regulationof active caspase-3 in CNS.We found that both active caspase-3and CD4 levels are regulated similarly to bioactive IL-16 inCNS of relapsing EAE mice. Similar correlations between lev-els of bioactive-IL-16 and active capsase-3 have been demon-strated in thyrocytes, which also require caspase-3 enzymaticcleavage of pro-IL-16 in order to produce and secrete IL-16[26]. Similarities in patterns of regulation between active cas-pase-3, CD4 and bioactive IL-16 raised the possibility that ac-tive caspase-3 may be contained in CD4C infiltrating cells,where it may cleave pro-IL-16. Previously, we describedCD4C IL-16Ccells within inflammatory infiltrates in F1 re-lapsing mice [15]. Previously and currently used IL-16 specificantibody does not recognize a distinction between pro-IL-16and bioactive IL-16. Therefore, it was necessary to investigatewhether active caspase-3 and IL-16 immunoreactivity colocal-ize. We show in Fig. 2 colocalization between IL-16 and activecaspase-3 in mononuclear infiltrating cells, further supportingthe importance of infiltrating CD4C T cells as a local sourceof bioactive IL-16 in F1 mice. Active caspase-3 immunoreac-tivity was not exclusive for IL-16 containingmononuclear cells,but was also observed in some neighboring IL-16- cells. Thisfinding corresponds to observations from other EAE studies re-porting the presence of active caspase-3 in oligodendrocytes,which suggested other potentially important roles, such as apo-ptosis of oligodendrocytes [27]. Finding significantly higherlevels of CD4 protein in CNS of mice with severe relapsing-remitting disease (F1), compared to low-relapsing B6 mice,was consistent with our previously reported differences in rela-tive numbers of infiltrating CD4C T cells [8]. Although ourdata support the role of CD4C T cells in producing bioactiveIL-16 in CNS of EAE mice, we expect that some other cell phe-notypes could also elaborate and locally release IL-16. We haveshown IL-16-immunoreactive B220C B cells and CD8CT cells but not Mac-3C macrophage/microglia in CNS of F1relapsing mice [15]. Presence of IL-16 has been reported inmicroglia in one rat EAE model, although it was not made clearwhether this was pro-IL-16 or bioactive IL-16, and if so mech-anisms of its production have not been addressed [28]. Potentialof other infiltrating and resident CNS cells to produce IL-16 in(B6 ! SJL) F1 EAEmice is currently being investigated in ourlaboratory (Skundric, unpublished data). In this paper we showdata relevant for production of IL-16 by CD4C T cells, becausethese cells represent the major infiltrating phenotype in relaps-ing F1 mice differently than in B6, where macrophageinfiltration predominates. The importance of CD4C T-cell-de-rived IL-16 for relapsing disease is further supported by recentfindings from several laboratories that reactivation of CD4C Tcells within the CNS compartment rather than in the peripheryrepresents one of the crucial mechanisms of relapse regulationin mice [29].Despite the site of reactivation in both B6 and SJL strains ofmice, autoreactive and other non-specifically activated CD4CT cells recirculate between CNS and peripheral lymphoidorgans throughout the course of relapsing-remitting disease[30,31]. To advance our understanding of IL-16 productionby activated T cells, not only in CNS but also in peripheral lym-phoid organs, we analyzed IL-16 and active caspase-3 regula-tion in inguinal lymph nodes and spleens from mice withrelapsing EAE. In peripheral lymphoid organs of mice withrelapsing and chronic EAE, we detected elevated levels ofprocessed IL-16 (55 kDa), bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa), and activecaspase-3. This data suggest that activated lymphocytes,including CD4C T cells, serve as sources of bioactive IL-16.Similar to our findings, the presence of processed forms ofIL-16 ranging from 32 kDa to 78 kDa have been reported inactivated CD4C T cells in vitro, and in vivo at the site ofdelayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [32,33]. To investigatefurther whether CD4C T cells activated in either non-specificor antigen-specific manner produce bioactive IL-16 in a cas-pase-3 specific manner, we isolated T cells from regional lymphnodes of (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice immunized with MOG35e55. Wedetected production of IL-16 (17 and 55 kDa) and elevation ofactive caspase-3, following either polyclonal activation orrestimulation with cognate antigen in vitro.Another important question that we addressed was whetherbiological function of elevated bioactive IL-16 in CNS of micewith relapsing EAE was to provide a chemoattractant signalfor CD4C T cells. To examine whether IL-16 functionally re-lates to CD4 in CNS, we performed co-immunoprecipitationexperiments. Data from those experiments revealed that IL-16 (17 kDa, 50e60 kDa) co-immunoprecipitated with CD4,which suggested a functional relationship between IL-16 andCD4 in CNS. Our data are consistent with recently publishedstudies showing an association between the cleaved C-terminusand intracellular N-terminus of IL-16 with CD4 co-receptor orwith kinases activated through TCR/CD4 signaling events[19,20]. This observed relationship between IL-16 (17 kDa)and CD4 in CNS of mice with EAE further supports the roleof bioactive IL-16 in CD4C T-cell chemoattraction.Overall, we demonstrate an elevated production of bioactiveIL-16, which corresponds to increased activation of caspase-3and massive infiltration by CD4C T cells in CNS of(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice with severe relapsing disease. We showsimilar patterns of regulation for IL-16 and active caspase-3 inperipheral lymphoid organs of relapsing EAE mice, and in Tcells isolated from lymph nodes following T-cell activation invitro. Finally, we provide evidence of a functional relationshipbetween CD4 and IL-16 proteins in CNS, suggesting thatone of the important roles of locally produced IL-16 may be inchemoattraction of additional waves of CD4C T cells. We pro-pose that infiltrating CD4CT cells serve as an important source214 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214of bioactive IL-16 in mice with relapsing disease. In turn, eleva-tion of intratechal bioactive IL-16 bears relevance for perpetua-tion and worsening of disease by providing a specificchemoattractant signal for additional waves of CD4C T cells.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Research Department of VAMedical Center inDetroit and especially Drs.
