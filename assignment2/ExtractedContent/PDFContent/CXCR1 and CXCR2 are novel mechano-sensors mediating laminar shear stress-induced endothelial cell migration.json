Thereceptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, known as G protein-coupled receptors which are essential for migratoryresponse of ECs toward the shear stress-dependent CXCL8 (interleukin-8), are potential mechano-sensorsfor mechanotransduction of the hemodynamic forces. In present study, the mRNA and protein expressionof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis under threeconditions of laminar shear stress (5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2) respectively. Using a scratched-woundassay, the effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were assessed by the percentage of wound closure while CXCR1and CXCR2 were functional blocked by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies. The results showed that the mRNAand protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was both upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress,but was both downregulated by 15.27 dyn/cm2. The wound closure was inhibited significantly while cellswere treated with those antibodies in all the conditions. It was suggested that CXCR1 and CXCR2 areinvolved in mediating the laminar shear stress-induced EC migration. Taken together, these findings indi-cated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are novel mechano-sensors mediating laminar shear stress-induced ECmigration. Understanding this expanded mechanism of laminar shear stress-induced cell migration willprovide novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\ufffd 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Shear stress has been shown to modulate endo-thelial cell (EC) migration by Ando et al. [2]. The migration of ECsplays critical roles in vascular physiology and pathology. For exam-ple, EC migration is a prominent component of re-endothelization,vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. In post-operative (i.e., bal-loon angioplasty or bypass surgery) wound progress, the migrationof nearby ECs into the injured area is crucial for wound closure andit could prevent the development of restenosis eventually.Persistent cell migration is a complex process that is physicallycoordinated both spatially and temporally, including the dynamicprocesses of cytoskeleton, the regulation of signal transduction,and the adhesion and detachment to neighboring cells or extracel-lular matrix (ECM) [3\u20135]. There are many studies focused on boththe molecular basis underlying modulation of EC migration by thell rights reserved.scular Diseases, West Chinauan, Chengdu 610041, China.fluid dynamic forces, and the spatially and temporally cellular sig-naling transduction [1,6]. However, how the mechanical forces aretransduced into ECs is unclear until now. So far as is known, thereare mechanical effects induced by fluid shear stress, contributingto cell deformation, spreading, movement, and shape changes[7,8]. The mechanical force can be highly sensitive by \u2018\u2018biochemicalreceptors\u2019\u2019 that act as mechano-sensors transducing shear stressinto cell biological responses [1,6].CXCR1 and CXCR2 are G protein-coupled receptors. The migra-tion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) towardCXCL8 is related to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 in vitro static conditions[9]. CXCL8 is one of the important chemokines that regulates cellcytoskeleton reassembly and migration [10]. Our previous studiesshowed that CXCL8 and shear stress were interacted in modulationthe functional activities of HUVECs [11], and the mRNA expressionof CXCL8 induced by shear stress was force intensity-dependentand time-dependent [12,13]. When HUVECs exposed to low fluidshear stress (2.23 dyn/cm2) for 1 or 2 h, the expression of CXCL8mRNA increased about 68 or 52 times as that of HUVECs exposedto high fluid shear stress (19.29 dyn/cm2). In additional toendothelial cells, CXCR1 and CXCR2 are expressed on melanoma[14], neutralization of CXCR1 and CXCR2 using small moleculeantagonists affects cell proliferation and migration [14], andhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2010.09.007mailto:liuxiaohg@sina.com.cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2010.09.007http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 43downregulation of CXCR1 or CXCR2 by employed a gene knock-down strategy decreasing melanoma cell migration [15]. Therefore,these results suggested that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are potential mec-hano-sensors mediating the shear stress-induced EC migration.Specially, different culture conditions in vitro have various influ-ences on the expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in ECs, although theexpression level of CXCR1 and CXCR2 is very low in vitro static con-ditions [9,16\u201318].Our investigations in this study focused on the mechanical\u2013bio-logical mechanism of the migratory response of ECs during exposedto laminar shear flow. Firstly, the mRNA expression of CXCR1 andCXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells under three conditions of laminar shearstress (5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2) was detected by RT-PCR anal-ysis, and the protein expression of them was also detected by Wes-tern blot analysis. Secondly, a scratched-wound assay was usedwhile the receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 were functional blocked byanti-CXCR1 alone, anti-CXCR2 alone and anti-CXCR1 in combinationwith anti-CXCR2. Finally, the effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were as-sessed by the index of the percentage of the wound closure. Our re-sults showed that the mRNA and protein expression of CXCR1 andCXCR2 was both upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress,but was both downregulated by 15.27 dyn/cm2. The wound closurewas inhibited significantly when CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 were blockedby those CXCL8 antibodies. Our results confirmed that the receptorsCXCR1 and CXCR2 are involved in mediating the laminar shearstress-induced EC migration. Overall, these findings suggested thatCXCR1 and CXCR2 played mechano-sensitive roles in modulationof laminar shear stress-induced EC migration.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureThe EA.hy926 cells (Hematology Research Institute of JiangsuProvince, China) are a hybridoma between HUVECs and the epithe-lioma A549 and retain most of the features of HUVECs, includingthe expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and human fac-tor VIII\u2013related Ag [19]. EA.hy926 cells were cultured at 37 \ufffdC with5% CO2 in RPMI1640 medium (pH 7.2\u20137.4, Gibco, USA) supple-mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hangzhou Sijiqing Bio-logical Engineering Materials Co., Ltd., China), 20 mmol/L HEPES(Sigma, USA), 2\u2030 NaHCO3 and 2% HAT (Sigma, USA). Cells of pas-sage 3 or 4 were then seeded onto glass slides that were pre-coatedwith 50 lg\ufffdml\ufffd1 Fibronectin (Roche, Germany) for 45 min at 37 \ufffdC.In most experiments, the cells were used 1\u20132 days after attainingconfluence, although a few experiments were performed 3\u20135 dayspostconfluence. The postconfluence time had no influence on theresults.2.2. Shear stress experimentsEA.hy926 cells were exposed to steady laminar shear stress usinga parallel flow chamber as previously described elsewhere [20,21].Briefly, the flow chamber was connected to a recirculation flow loopvia Masterflex PharMed tube (Cole-Parmer Instrument, Vernon Hills,IL). Flow in the loop was provided by a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parm-er, USA) drawing fluid (serum-free RPMI1640 medium) from a mainreservoir, which subsequently passed into two buffer reservoirs todampened pulsatility before entering the flow chamber. Flow exit-ing from the chamber was recirculated back into the main reservoir.Medium was equilibrated with 5% CO2 /95% air, and the temperaturewas maintained at 37 \ufffdC by placing the main and buffer reservoirs ina temperature-controlled water bath. Laminar shear stress was con-trolled by changing the medium flow rate. Three levels of shearstress were applied in this study: a relatively \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 shear stress of5.56 dyn/cm2 that typifies shear stress levels within disturbed flowregions, a relatively \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 15.27 dyn/cm2 that is typ-ical for undisturbed flow zones within large arteries, and a relatively\u2018\u2018mid\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 10.02 dyn/cm2 reflecting within the physiolog-ical range in human major arteries. Static controls were also concur-rently performed.2.3. RT-PCR detectionThe mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in shear stress stim-ulated EA.hy926 cells was semi-quantitatively detected by reversetranscription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after variousexposure time. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the TRI-zol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), and then RT-PCR was carried out byusing the TaKaRa One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa, Dalian,China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To obtainthe relative quantitative values for gene expression, glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endog-enous control. Sequences of the primers used for RT-PCR weredesigned by Dalian Biotechnology (China) as follows:Gene name: CXCR1.Sense primer: 50CCAGTCCAGTTTGCTATGAGGT30.Anti-sense primer: 50TGTAGGAGGTAACACGATGACG30.Gene name: CXCR2.Sense primer: 50TACTCTTTGCCCTGACCTTGC30.Anti-sense primer: 50GGGTGAATCCGTAGCAGAACA30.Gene name: GAPDH.Sense primer: 50AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG30.Anti-sense primer: 50AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC30.The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1%agarose gel in 1 \ufffd Tris\u2013acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer after stainingwith 0.5 lg\ufffdml\ufffd1 ethidium bromide. Images were analyzed by Im-age Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).2.4. Western blot analysisEA.hy926 cells were treated with different shear stress magni-tudes at various exposure time, and then proteins were extractedaccording to protein extraction kit (PMSF methods, Beyotime Bio-tech, China). Protein concentration was measured using a bicinch-oninic acid protein assay (BCA method, BioDev-Tech. Co., Ltd.,China). Protein samples (80 lg/lane) were separated on precastSDS\u2013PAGE (10% resolving gel with 5% stacking) and semi-drytransferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF, Mil-lipore, USA). Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperaturewith blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), and probed with1:500 (or 1:200) diluted primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech-nology, USA) specific for the target protein. Membranes were incu-bated at 4 \ufffdC overnight, followed by incubation for 1 h at roomtemperature with a 1:5000 diluted HRP-linked secondary antibod-ies goat antimouse IgG (Zhongshan Goldenbridge BiotechnologyCo., Ltd., China). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized usingthe enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, USA) followingthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Images were captured by Omega16ic\u2122 AFP-Imaging System (ULTRA\ufffdLUM, INC., USA), and analyzedby Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).2.5. Scratch wound migration assayCell migration was measured using a monolayer scratch injuryassay, as described previously [22,23]. Briefly, the EA.hy926 cells44 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351were seeded on glass chamber slides and cultured until confluence.Then, a uniform straight scratch was performed in the cell mono-layer by using a plastic Cell Scrapper (Corning, USA). Monolayerswere washed gently, marked (for reference) and photographedusing an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-Y system, Ja-pan). Cells treating without or with 50 ng \ufffdml\ufffd1 anti-CXCR1 or/andanti-CXCR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and laminar shearflows were applied in the direction that is orthogonal to thewound. Images of the wounds under both static and flow condi-tions were acquired at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h. Shear controls (cells weretreated without antibodies) were also concurrently performed.2.6. Assessment of wound closureEA.hy926 cell migration during the process of wound closurewas analyzed using the image analysis software (Image Pro Plus6.0, Media Cybernetics, USA). The acquired image was convertedfrom pixels to micrometers with the use of a calibration image,then the area could be tabulated while an outline of the woundwas traced [24,25]. The levels of wound closure could be assessedby the ratio of closure area to initial wound as follows:Rn \u00bc\u00f0A0 \ufffd An\u00deA0\ufffd 100%where Rn represents the percentage of wound closure; An representsthe residual area of wound at the metering point n (h) and A0 rep-resents the area of initial wound (Fig. 1).2.7. Statistical analysisData were presented as means \u00b1 SD at least 10 images obtainedfrom three different experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Sta-tistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test using SPSS17.0 software package. Differences in means were considered sig-nificant if P < 0.05.3. Results and analysis3.1. The mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells isupregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2, but is downregulated by 10.02 and15.27 dyn/cm2The mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was assessed byRT-PCR (Fig. 2). Under low shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2, a trendtoward increasing of the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 withFig. 1. Definition of quantitatively assess the wound closure by the percentage of wounwhere Rn represents the percentage of wound closure; An represents the residual area oexposure time was observed (Fig. 2B). Specifically, the mRNA expres-sion of CXCR1 was significantly increased at 25 min (P < 0.05),peaked at 2 h (63.87 \u00b1 9.45% at 2 h vs. 45.27 \u00b1 0.97% under staticconditions, P < 0.01), subsequently, slight descent occurred at 4 h(60.02 \u00b1 1.23% at 4 h vs. 45.27 \u00b1 0.97% under static conditions,P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of CXCR2 was significantly in-creased at 30 min (P < 0.05), and peaked at 2 h (37.68 \u00b1 2.7% at 2 hvs. 21.4 \u00b1 1.12% under static conditions, P < 0.01), respectively.Under 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2, the mRNA expression of CXCR1had an apparent descending trend with exposure time (Fig. 2C and2D). It was significantly decreased after 25 min (P < 0.05). Similarly,under 15.27 dyn/cm2, the mRNA expression of CXCR2 also had a dec-linate trend with exposure time (Fig. 2D). It was significantly de-creased at 20 min later (P < 0.05). However, the mRNA expressionof CXCR2 under 10.02 dyn/cm2 was relatively stable (Fig. 2C).Interestingly, the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 ap-peared a fast increase in 30 min \ufffd 1 h (about 9.79% and 6.12%,respectively) under 5.56 dyn/cm2, a rapid decrease in 30 min \ufffd 1 h(about 6.52% and 2.01%, respectively) under 10.02 dyn/cm2 andalso a rapid decrease in 25 \ufffd 30 min (about 8.16% and 3.70%,respectively) under 15.27 dyn/cm2. These results suggested that arapid onset occurred at different exposure time while cells respondto different shear stress.Overall, these results demonstrated that the mRNA expressionof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was shear stress-dependent.In addition, in all these shear stress conditions, the mRNA expres-sion of CXCR1 was much higher than that of CXCR2 (P < 0.01).3.2. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells isalso shear stress-dependentThe protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was measured byWestern blot (Fig. 3). Under low shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2, theprotein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was increased in 1 \ufffd 4 h(P < 0.05 at 1 h, P < 0.01 at 2 and 4 h), peaked at 4 h and maintainedrelatively stable later. For instance, under low shear stress for 4 h,the protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was respectively in-creased to about 2.3 and 4.3 times than that under staticconditions.Under mid shear stress of 10.02 dyn/cm2, the protein expressionof CXCR1 and CXCR2 was increased slightly. Specifically, the signif-icant increase was observed in the protein expression of CXCR1 at2 h (P < 0.05) while not in that of CXCR2.Under high shear stress of 15.27 dyn/cm2, the protein expres-sion of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was decreased with exposure time.

The mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells under laminar shear flow. The mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 at various exposure time was semi-quantitatively detected by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to obtain the relative quantitative values for gene expression, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control. (A) The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in 1 \ufffd Tris\u2013acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer after staining with 0.5 lg\ufffdml\ufffd1 ethidium bromide. (B) \ufffd (D) Images were analyzed by Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA). All data presented as thefold-change over control in GAPDH. The CXCR1 mRNA and CXCR2 mRNA were both increased under low shear stress (5.56 dyn/cm2), and decreased under high shear stress(15.27 dyn/cm2). Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD, *P < 0.05 vs. static control (the CXCR1 mRNA and the CXCR2 mRNA, respectively), **P < 0.01 vs. static control.Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 45of them were significantly decreased at 2 h (P < 0.05). Specially, theexpression of the CXCR2 protein declined rapidly in 2 \ufffd 4 h(P < 0.01 at 4 h later).Similar to above results of the mRNA expression of CXCR1 andCXCR2, these results suggested that the protein expression ofCXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was also shear stress-depen-dent, which was upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2, but was downregu-lated by 15.27 dyn/cm2.3.3. Laminar shear stress enhances the asymmetric EC migrationFig. 4 showed the percentages of the wound closure whenEA.hy926 cells were exposed to different magnitudes of laminarshear stress for various time. It was clear that shear stress causedsignificantly faster wound closure than the static control(P < 0.05). Specifically, compared with the static control, the per-centages of wound closure induced by 5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2 was respectively increased about 2, 2.4 and 3.3 times at 1 h,about 1.6, 1.9 and 2.5 times at 2 h, about 1.9, 2.4 and 3.1 times at4 h, and about 2, 2.4 and 3 times at 8 h. Therefore, it can be con-cluded that laminar shear stress enhances the migration of endo-thelial cells.In particular, under static conditions, cells from both edges ofthe wound migrated equally to cover the wounded area (Fig. 4A).However, under 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress, the covered area oneach side of the wound was different. More specifically, cells inthe upriver of the wound migrated farther than that in thedownriver (Fig. 4A). It could be found distinctly at 8 h. The samephenomenon also occurred in the shear conditions of 10.02 and15.27 dyn/cm2. It was indicated that the laminar shear flow has apushing force to cells in upriver and a retarding force to cells indownriver, which is responsible for the asymmetric migration ofECs, i.e., the pushing force can enhance the wound closure whilethe retarding force appears inhibiting effects. In other words, lam-inar shear flow provides a traction force for asymmetric cell migra-tion along the direction of flow.3.4. Laminar shear stress-enhanced EC migration via CXCR1 andCXCR2EA.hy926 cells were treated with 50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1 anti-CXCR1 and/oranti-CXCR2. Then, the shear stress induced wound closure was ob-tained as shown in Figs 5\u20137.Under 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 5), the levels of woundclosure were inhibited while cells were treated with anti-CXCR1alone (about 43% at 1 h, 45% at 2 h, 42% at 4 h and 42% at 8 h,respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2alone (about 65% at 2 h, 62% at 4 h and 62% at 8 h, respectively.P < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combi-nation with anti-CXCR2 (about 34% at 1 h, 35% at 2 h, 31% at 4 hand 29% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control).Under 10.02 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 6), the levels of woundclosure were also inhibited while cells were treated with anti-CXCR1 alone (about 43% at 2 h, 39% at 4 h and 40% at 8 h,Fig. 3. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells under laminar shear flow. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was measured by Western blot.(A) EA.hy926 cells were treated with different mechanical stimuli for various time and then proteins were extracted. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using theenhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, USA). Images were captured by using Omega 16ic\u2122 AFP-Imaging System (ULTRA\ufffdLUM, INC., USA), and analyzed by Image Pro Plus6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA). (B) Relative quantification of the CXCR1 and CXCR2 proteins in EA.hy926 cells. Western blot analysis showed that CXCR1 and CXCR2 were bothincreased under 5.56 dyn/cm2, but were both decreased under 15.27 dyn/cm2. Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD, *P < 0.05 vs. static control (the CXCR1 protein and the CXCR2 protein,respectively), **P < 0.01 vs. static control.46 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2alone (about 57% at 2 h, 51% at 4 h and 49% at 8 h, respectively.P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combi-nation with anti-CXCR2 (about 35% at 1 h, 30% at 2 h, 24% at 4 hand 37% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control).Similar to those results under shear stress of 5.56 and10.02 dyn/cm2, under 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 7), the levelsof wound closure were inhibited while cells were treated withanti-CXCR1 alone (about 50% at 1 h, 47% at 2 h, 46% at 4 h and48% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control), withanti-CXCR2 alone (about 77% at 1 h, 35% at 2 h, 53% at 4 h and60% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control), andwith anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2 (about 46% at1 h, 41% at 2 h, 43% at 4 h and 45% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control).As mentioned above, different percentages of wound closureswere obtained under different conditions. It was implied that themechanism of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mediating cell migration maybe different in various shear conditions. However, the wound clo-sure which is depended on shear stress is inhibited by the antibod-ies at all these magnitudes. These results suggested that laminarshear stress-enhanced EC migration via CXCR1 and CXCR2.4. DiscussionOur investigation demonstrates CXCR1 and CXCR2 are novelmechano-sensors mediating laminar shear stress-induced ECmigration. The vascular endothelial cell monolayer is a metaboli-cally active monolayer which is constantly exposed to both bio-chemical and biomechanical stimuli in the forms of cyclicstretch, hydrostatic pressure and shear stress [1]. In vascularremodeling, fluid shear stress is a primary stimulus. Blood flowin the straight parts of the aorta is a relatively simple laminar flowwith a magnitude of shear stress in the range of 10\u201340 dyn/cm2.The flow will become disturbed and unsteady at the atherosclero-sis-prone regions of the arterial tree (at curvatures and bifurca-tions), and there may occur a secondary flow with low velocities[26]. Exposing ECs to low shear stress would lead to an inflamma-tory and hence proatherogenic cellular phenotype, whereas sub-jecting cells to high shear stress results in a phenotype that islargely anti-inflammatory and therefore atheroprotective [6,27].Shear stress dose-dependently enhances migration of HUVECs,with a maximum at 45 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress [28]. In pres-ent study, three levels of shear stress are adopted: a relatively\u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2 that typifies shear stress levelsFig. 4. Effect of laminar shear stress on wound closure and EA.hy926 cell migration. (A) Laminar shear stress enhanced the wound closure progression. EA.hy926 cells wererespectively exposed to three different levels of laminar shear stress 5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2 for 1, 4 and 8 h. (B) The percentage of wound closure under differentlaminar shear stress for various time. Shear stress caused significantly faster wound closure than the static control. The wound closure was increased with the shear stressand time. More specifically, cells in the upriver of the wound migrated farther than that in the downriver. It could be found distinctly at 8 h. It was suggested that laminarshear flow provides a traction force for cell migration along the direction of flow. Overall, laminar shear stress enhances the asymmetric EC migration. Bars indicatedmean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies in various conditions. *P < 0.05 vs. static control.Y.

Shear stress at all these magnitudes has been shown toactivate EC signal transduction and induced the expression of sev-eral genes in vitro [29].Wounding of EA.hy926 cells confluent monolayer provokescell migration in the direction of the wound under both staticand flow conditions. Our results show that the wound closureof the EA.hy926 cells monolayer on each side covers equally tothe wounded area under static conditions, but appears differentmigrating behaviors under flow conditions. For instance, cells inthe upriver of the wound migrate farther than that in the down-river. It indicates that the flow has a pushing force to the cells inupriver edge and a retarding force to the cells in downriver edge.In other words, laminar shear flow produces a traction forcewhich contributes to the cell migration. It is also documentedby Hsu and Gojova et al. that there exists an asymmetry of thespeed profiles between the upriver and the downriver sides inthe wounded bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) monolayer[21,30]. Recent studies have shown that shear stress-inducedasymmetric shape and migration direction of ECs are mediatedthrough Rho and Rac GTPases [31]. Shiu et al. [32] reported thatshear stress enhances the migration speed of ECs by modulatingthe biophysical forces of traction through the biochemical activa-tion of Rho-associated protein kinase Rhop160ROCK. Therefore,shear stress may enhance the asymmetric migration may throughthe traction and the downstream signaling activation of Rho andRac GTPases.Albuquerque et al. [24] reported that cell area increases withtime even in static monolayer; shear stress significantly enhancescell spreading, and shear stress (3 dyn/cm2) also stimulates thelargest increase of cell area in both HUVECs and HCAECs. In presentstudy, we assume that both cell spreading and cell area are invari-able under the same shear stress and at the same exposure time.Hence, the different percentages of wound closure under the sameconditions are due to cell migration.All ELR + CXC chemokines mediating angiogenesis highlightsthe importance of identifying a common receptor that mediatestheir biological function in promoting angiogenesis [33]. Thecandidate CXC chemokine receptors are CXCR1 and/or CXCR2.Fig. 5. 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies.

The levels of wound closure were inhibited while cells were treated with anti-CXCR1 alone (about 43% at 1 h, 45% at 2 h, 42% at 4 h and 42% at 8 h, respectively.

Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies under 5.56 dyn/cm2. * P < 0.05 vs.5.56 dyn/cm2 control.48 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351The CXCR1 receptor is highly specific for CXCL8, whereas, theCXCR2 receptor responds to multiple CXC-chemokines includingneutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), growth-related oncogens(GROa, b, c), and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 [17,34].Although both receptors internalize via arrestin/dynamin-depen-dent mechanisms, CXCR2 internalizes more rapidly (\ufffd95% CXCR2vs. \ufffd10% CXCR1 in the first 5\u201310 min) and recovers more slowly(\ufffd35% CXCR2 vs. 100% of CXCR1 after 90 min) at the leukocyte cellsurface than CXCR1 [35,36]. Generally speaking, expression of thetwo receptors and their affinity to CXCL8 are different with celltypes. For example, migration is primarily mediated by CXCR1 inleukocyte [37], and by CXCR2 in NIH3T3 cells [38]. It is well knownthat the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 exist on HUVECsin vitro [9,16,17]; the expression of CXC chemokine receptorsmay be affected by culture conditions and various stimuli [39].Although HUVECs express low levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in staticconditions [9,16,17], both of the mRNA and protein expression ofCXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress, but is downregulated by 15.27 dyn/cm2. Our results are also confirmed that the mRNA expression ofCXCR1 and CXCR2 in HUVECs had the same change trend with thatin EA.hy926 cells (supplement 1).Different flow patterns and magnitudes of shear stress can exertdifferent effects on a number of endothelial cells signaling andgene and protein expressions [40\u201342]. In vitro experiments usingparallel-plate flow chamber with cultured endothelial cells haveshown that the CXCL8 mRNA expression of HUVECs at 2.23 dyn/cm2 increased about 68 or 52 times as that at 19. 29 dyn/cm2[13]. Sustained exposure to low levels of shear (1.8 dyn/cm2) or abrief exposure (<1 h) to 10 dyn/cm2 caused a sustained stimulationof endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, but exposure to 6\u201325 dyn/cm2 forP6 h dramatically inhibited ET-1 release [43]. According to Maleket al. [44], the shear stress of arterial level induces endothelial qui-escence and an atheroprotective gene expression profile, while thelow shear stress, which is prevalent at atherosclerosis-prone sites,stimulates an atherogenic phenotype. Our report here is consistentwith Malek\u2019s opinion. At the arterial low shear stress area, highexpression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on locally sheared endothelialcells mediates cell migration, may be one of the artherogenicmechanisms.Fig. 6. 10.02 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies. (A) Effect of the CXCL8 receptor antibodies on the wound closureprogression induced by 10.02 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress. (B) The percentages of wound closure under 10.02 dyn/cm2 for various time while cells were respectively treatedwith anti-CXCR1 alone, anti-CXCR2 alone and anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2. The levels of wound closure were also inhibited while cells were treated withanti-CXCR1 alone (about 43% at 2 h, 39% at 4 h and 40% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2 alone (about 57% at 2 h, 51% at 4 h and 49% at8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2 (about 35% at 1 h, 30% at 2 h, 24% at 4 h and 37% at 8 h,respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control). Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies under 10.02 dyn/cm2. *P < 0.05 vs.10.02 dyn/cm2 control.Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 49Furthermore, fluid shear stress can modulate functions of endo-thelial cells in blood vessels by activating mechano-sensors, signal-ing pathways, and gene and protein expressions [45]. In order tostudy the effect of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EC migration, we have ob-tained optimum CXCL8 antibodies concentration under static con-ditions. The static cultured controls are performed on EA.hy926cells at various concentrations of anti-CXCR1 or/and anti-CXCR2,while the concentration of CXCL8 receptor antibodies is above50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1, the wound closure is not significantly changed (datanot shown). Therefore, the CXCL8 receptor antibodies with a con-centration of 50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1 is chosen for the blockade of the receptorsCXCR1 and/or CXCR2.As expected, the migratory response of EA.hy926 cells inducedby shear stress can be significantly suppressed by anti-CXCR1alone, anti-CXCR2 alone or anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2, respectively.Our results have demonstrated that the receptors CXCR1 andCXCR2 participate in the EC sensing of mechanical stimulations,and the shear stress-induced EC migration can be inhibited whileantibodies against CXCR1 and CXCR2. It was suggested that CXCR1and CXCR2 played important roles in mediating the endothelial cellmigration induced by shear stress at all these magnitudes,although there maybe exist other receptors mediating shearstress-induced endothelial cell migration. Therefore, antibodiesagainst CXCR1 and CXCR2 can inhibit EC migration that inducedby shear stress at all these magnitudes.Overall, cell migration depends on whether CXCR1 and CXCR2are blocked, on whether flow is applied, and on what magnitudesof shear stress is exerted on cells.In particular, under 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress, the expressionof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is downregulated. But thewound closure, which can be blocked by functional CXCL8 antibod-ies, is greatly enhanced. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence as-say was used to determine CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression on thesurface of EA.hy926 cells. Our results showed that both CXCR1and CXCR2 were expression on the surface of ECs. The expressionof them enhanced by 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress, but inhibited by15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress, especially exposure for 4 h. It wassuggested that the distribution of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on the surfaceof ECs was shear stress-dependent (supplement 2). Our resultsFig. 7. 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies.

P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2 (about 46% at 1 h, 41% at 2 h, 43% at 4 h and 45%at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control).

Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351indicated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are mechano-sensors mediatinglaminar shear stress-induced EC migration. The traction forcemaybe has pure classical physics effects on cell migration that isthe subject of Newton\u2019s third law of motion.With respect to cell motility, reorganization of the actin cyto-skeleton is the primary mechanism [46]. Singh et al. showed thatknock-down of CXR1 and CXCR2 affects CXCL-8-induced actinreorganization and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in melanoma cells,and then decreased the melanoma cell migration [47]. Schraufstat-ter et al. showed that lung microvascular endothelial cells expressCXCR1 and CXCR2 and CXCL-8 activates Rho and Rac signalingpathways through these receptors [17]. Interestingly, CXCL-8 ini-tially activates Rho and actin stress fiber formation in endothelialcells due to activation of the CXCR1; at later time points, Rac isactivated in a CXCR2-dependent fashion, leading to cell retractionand gap formation between neighboring cells [17]. Our next workwill further validate whether there are differences between CXCR1and CXCR2 in mechanical signal transduction.It has become increasingly clear that the CXCL8 receptorsCXCR1 and CXCR2 exhibit critical effects in cell migration, whichcontributes to angiogenesis relevant to cancer. Additionally, it isknown that CXCL8 signaling activates members of the RhoGTPase family via the receptors CXCR1/2; then activates a num-ber of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., Src family kinases andFAK) that regulate the architecture of the cell cytoskeleton andits interaction with the surrounding extracellular environment[10]. Perhaps traction and the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 andCXCR2 have a common downstream signaling pathway such asthe activation of Rho and Rac GTPases. These novel moleculartargets can be discovered to facilitate the development of newtherapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of cardiovas-cular diseases and cancer.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported in part by grant from National Natu-ral Science Foundation of China (Nos. 30570450, 10772127,10972148), Sichuan Youth Science & Technology Foundation (No.06ZQ026-009), and Program for New Century Excellent Talents inUniversity of China (No. NCET-06-0791).Y.
