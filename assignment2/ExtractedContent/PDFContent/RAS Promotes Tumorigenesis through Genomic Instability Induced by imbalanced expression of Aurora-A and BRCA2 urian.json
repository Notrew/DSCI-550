To better understand how RASfunctions, we measured the activity of the functionally related genes Aurora-A and BRCA2 inovarian cancer cell lines and tumor samples containing RAS mutations. We found that Aurora-Aand BRCA2 inversely controlled RAS-associated genomic instability and ovarian tumorigenesisthrough regulation of cytokinesis and polyploidization. Over-expression of mutated RAS ablatedBRCA2 expresson but induced Aurora-A accumulation at the midbody, leading to abnormalcytokinesis and ultimately chromosomal instability via polyploidy in cancer cells. RAS regulatesthe expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through dysregulated protein expression of farnesylprotein transferase \u03b2 (FT\u03b2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3).

Activation of RAS largelydepends on its active form without CAAX at the C-terminus (C, Cys; A, usually aliphaticamino acid; X, another amino acid) that is processed by farnesyl transferase (FT) duringposttranslational modification of RAS proteins 2. Thus, various inhibitors of farnesyl proteintransferase activity, designed to prevent the farnesylation of RAS, have been developed totreat RAS-associated cancers 3. The insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)was shown to block RAS cleavage and thus to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase in lungcarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 4. These reports suggest that FT andIGFBP-3 may be involved in regulating RAS-induced genomic instability and tumordevelopment.Genomic instability is largely classified into two types: microsatellite instability, which isassociated with a mutator phenotype, and chromosome instability, which is associated withgross chromosomal abnormalities 5. The centrosome is believed to play an important role inmaintaining chromosome stability by aiding in the formation of bipolar spindles during celldivision 6, thereby ensuring equal segregation of duplicated chromosomes into two daughtercells. While multipolar mitotic spindles are usually resulted from various centrosomeabnormalities such as amplification in cancer cells, which leads to unequal distribution ofchromosomes and results in aneuploidy or polyploidy of daughter cells 7. The serine/threonine kinase Aurora-A (AURKA) plays a critical role in maintenance of genetic stabilitythrough regulation of centrosome separation, bipolar spindle assembly, and chromosomesegregation 8, 9; at the same time, however, amplification of Aurora-A increases the numberof centrosomes and mutiplolar spindles, which have been observed in numerous humancancers 10, 11. Recent studies have shown that Aurora-A is required for RAS-mediatedoncogenic transformation of oral cancer 12 and bladder cancer 13. Thus, Aurora-A may beassociated with genomic instability in RAS-induced tumorigenesis.The breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) is a tumor suppressor gene that is known tobe involved in maintaining genomic stability in different cancers 14. Although BRCA2 israrely mutated in sporadic cancers such as ovarian and breast cancers, the transcription orexpression of BRCA2 is repressed in these tumor tissues 15. Loss of BRCA2 either bymutation or transcriptional and post-transcriptional aberrations is associated with cancergenomic instability 16. Recently, a study revealed that a heterozygous germline mutation ofBRCA2 can promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas driven by Kras (G12D) mutation 17,while another report showed that BRCA2 in HCT116 (a colon cancer cell line) can besuppressed by activated KRAS in 3D culture 18. In addition, studies have shown thatBRCA2 mutation is associated with Aurora-A amplification in breast cancer 19 and thatBRCA2 may suppress polyploidy by stabilizing Aurora-A 20. We have shown recently thatAurora-A can suppress BRCA2 expression in ovarian cancer 21. The above evidencesuggests that Aurora-A and BRCA2 likely function to synergistically regulate RAS-inducedgenomic instability and tumorigenesis, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.To improve our understanding how RAS regulates the genomic instability, we designed astudy to investigate the function of Aurora-A and BRCA2 in relation to RAS activation.Because the RAS/RAF mutation accounts for 30\u201340% of low-grade serous and borderlineovarian cancer cases 22, we mainly conducted the study in ovarian cancer cell lines andhuman ovarian tumor tissues with RAS mutations. Our results provide insight into howRAS/RAF mutations induce genomic instability and tumorigenesis.Yang et al. Page 2Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptMaterials and MethodsPlasmids, siRNAsWe used pBabe/Aurora-A/puromycin 23 and pBabe/U6/Aurora-A shRNA (targeting 5\u2032-GUCUUGUGUCCUUCAAAUU-3\u2032 of Aurora-A mRNA) (puromycin or neomycin) 21 todeliver Aurora-A into immortalized ovarian epithelial cell lines T29 and T80 and Aurora-AshRNA into RAS-transformed cell lines T29H, T80H, and ovarian cancer cell line HEY. Aplasmid (PCINBRCA2) containing a full-length BRCA2 cDNA was used to deliver BRCA2into RAS-transformed cells and Capan-1 cells (a pancreatic cancer cell line) using apreviously described method 24. Clones were selected after confirmation of BRCA2expression by Western blotting. The retroviral expression plasmid IGFBP-3 (pBabe/IGFBP-3/puromycin) was generated with a pair of primers (sense: 5\u2032-ATGGATCCatgcagcgggcgcgacccacgctc-3\u2032, bold cases are BamHI site, and antisense: 5\u2032-CAGAATTCctacttgctctgcatgctgtagc-3\u2032, italic cases are EcoRI site) using a template of anadenoviral expression vector containing IGFBP-3 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Ho-YoungLee). pBabe/U6/IGFBP-3 shRNA/puromycin was generated to target IGFBP-3 mRNA at403\u2013422nt (5\u2032-ggaaatgctagtgagtcgga-3\u2032) using the protocols described in our previouspublication 25. The control vectors were empty plasmids (pBabe/puromycin or PCIN) orconstructed by directly inserting GFP shRNA into pBabe/U6/puromycin or neomycinvectors 26. Retrovirus production and target cell infection were performed with our well-established method 25. FT\u03b2 siRNA (#sc-35417) and control siRNA(#sc-37007) werepurchased from Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). FTI-276 (#F9553) was purchasedfrom Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).Cell culture and tumor formationT29, T29H, T80, and T80H cells have been described previously 27. Ovarian cancer celllines HOC-7, SKOV3 and HEY and pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 were cultured withEMEM or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. T29 cellstransformed by KRASV12 (T29K) was described previously 27. To generate tumor growth invivo, we subcutaneously injected 5 \u00d7 106 T29H/BRCA2, T80H/BRCA2, T29/Aurora-A,T80/Aurora-A, T29H/Aurora-A shRNA (Aurora-Ai), T80H/Aurora-Ai cells or control cellsexpressing empty vectors or GFP shRNA (GFPi) into 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c nu/nu mice(U.S. National Cancer Institute\u2019s Frederick Cancer Research Facility) following protocolsapproved by the institutional committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center for animalexperiments. For T29H and T80H cells transfected with BRCA2, one of three clones fromeach cell line with high BRCA2 expression was used to conduct tumor formation assays.Each cell line was injected into 2 sites in 8 mice, for a total of 16 injections. Tumor burdenwas assessed and recorded using methods described previously 28.Western blottingFor all Western blots, we analyzed samples with a total of 40-\u03bcg proteins from whole-celllysates using the protocol described in our previous publication 21. The primary antibodyused to detect Aurora-A (cat. #GTX13824) was obtained from GeneTex (Irvine, CA), whilethe antibody used to detect BRCA2 (cat. #MAB2476) was from R&D Systems(Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against RAS either targeting N-terminus (#sc-166691) or C-terminus (#sc-521, KRAS; #sc-520, HRAS) and antibodies against IGFBP-3 (#sc-9028),FT\u03b1 (#sc-487), and FT\u03b2 (# sc-137) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. (SantaCruz, CA). \u03b2-Actin (cat. #A2228, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as a loadingcontrol. T29/Vector and T29/Aurora-A cells were treated with proteosome inhibitorMG-132 (Sigma) at the concentration of 10 \u03bcM and analyzed for the expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 by Western blotting. The intensity of protein bands was quantified withImageJ software downloaded from NIH website (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).Yang et al. Page 3Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscripthttp://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining was performed according to a published protocol 21. Primaryantibodies against Aurora-A and BRCA2 were obtained from GeneTex and R&D Systems,respectively. DNA dye To-Pro-3 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). Inbrief, cells were cultured in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) for24 h, fed with fresh medium to increase the number of mitotic cells for 8\u201316 h, and thenfixed (with PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde solution: 3% paraformaldehyde, PBS, pH 7.4,2% sucrose) and permeabilized (with a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100,20 mMHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose). Slides were blocked by a 2-h incubation with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% goat serum in PBS, and then theslides were incubated with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. Afterward, the cells wereincubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013conjugated secondary antibody againstmouse IgG or Texas red\u2013conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearchLaboratory, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. Stained cells were examined and photographedwith an Olympus FV500 confocal fluorescence microscope.Cell cycle and cytogenetic analysisCells were applied for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry according to our previsoulypublished method 21. T29/vector, T29/Aurora-A, T80/vector, T80/Aurora-A, T29H/GFPi,T29H/Aurora-Ai, T80H/vector, T80H/BRCA2 cells were cultured for 24 and collected forchromosome preparation using standard procedures 29. Briefly, cells were exposed toColcemid(0.04 \u03bcg/mL) for 1 h, subjected to hypotonic treatment(0.075 M KCl for 20\u201325min at room temperature), and fixed in a mixture of methanol and acetic acid. Slides werestained with Giemsa stain and examined for structural and numerical abnormalities in thechromosomes. A minimum of 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed for each cell line, andrepresentative spreads were captured using a Genetiscan imaging system. The proportionswere compared using chi-squared analysis of Fisher exact test. The assay was repeatedlyperformed by Molecular Cytogenetics Core Facility personnel in the Department of Geneticsat The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.Immunostaining of Aurora-A and BRCA2Ovarian tumor tissues from 22 patients diagnosed with low-grade serous carcinoma orborderline tumor were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2. KRAS/BRAF mutations with either G12V or V600E were identified fromtissue genomic DNA of all cases by PCR amplification with specific primers targeting thecoding regions of RAS-G12V and RAF-V600E, followed by sequencing of the DNAfragment. Ten cases were confirmed with RAS/RAF mutations, while the remaining caseslacked KRAS/BRAF mutations. The use of tissue blocks and chart reviews were approvedby the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.Slides were treated and stained using the method published before 21. The primary antibodyagainst Aurora-A (GTX13824, monoclonal antibody, Genetax) or BRCA2 (MAB2476,monoclonal antibody, R&D Systems) was applied at a dilution of 1:200 or 1:100 at 4\u00b0C in ahumidified chamber.Evaluation of staining intensity and expression percentage for BRCA2 and Aurora-A wasscored. using the following criterias: Tissues with <5% of cells positive for BRCA2 orAurora-A were given a score of 0, those with 5% \u2013 20% positive cells were scored as 1,those with 20% \u2013 40% positive cells were scored as 2, those with 50% \u2013 70% positive cellswere scored as 3, and those with 70% \u2013 100% were scored as 4. The expression correlationof BRCA2 and Aurora-A was analyzed by Pearson\u2019s correlation using SPSS16.0 software.Yang et al. Page 4Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptCell treatment with FT\u03b2 siRNA or FTI-276To transfect HEY and T29K cells with FT\u03b2 siRNA, 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well in 6-well plateswere used for FT\u03b2 siRNA and control siRNA transfection using the manufacturer\u2019s protocolfrom Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The transfection medium was replaced withfresh growth medium 12 h later, and the cells were kept in culture for additional 24, 48, and72 h and harvested to detect FT\u03b2, Aurora-A, and BRCA2 expression. A similar cell numberwas used for treatment either with FTI-276 for 24 h and the cells were analyzed forexpression of the above-listed proteins.ResultsRAS-induced transformation enhances Aurora-A expression but represses BRCA2expressionTo better understand how RAS promotes genomic instability, we measured the expression ofBRCA2 and Aurora-A in RAS-transformed human ovarian surface epithelial cell linespreviously developed in our lab 27. While the expression of BRCA2 was markedly lower inRAS-transformed cells than in control cells (Figure 1A), the expression of Aurora-A wasdramatically increased in these cells, suggesting that RAS suppresses the expression ofBRCA2 but increases the expression of Aurora-A. Next, we determined whether BRCA2can regulate the expression of Aurora-A or RAS by transfecting RAS-transformed ovarianepithelial cell lines (T29H and T80H) with a vector expressing BRCA2 24. Selected stableclones with ectopic expression of BRCA2 showed a marked decrease of Aurora-A and RAS(Figure 1B), indicating that BRCA2 suppresses Aurora-A and RAS expression. Todetermine whether Aurora-A can suppress the expression of BRCA2, we delivered Aurora-A cDNA into immortalized non-tumorigenic T29 and T80 cells (Aurora-A; Figure 1C\u2013D) orsilenced Aurora-A expression in T29H and T80H cells with Aurora-A\u2013specific short hairpinRNA (shRNA) (Aurora-Ai; Figure 1C\u2013D). Ectopic expression of Aurora-A suppressedBRCA2 expression, but did not stimulate RAS expression in T29 and T80 cells comparedwith in vector-transfected control cells, and knockdown of Aurora-A restored the BRCA2level and reduced RAS expression in T29H and T80H cells, suggesting that Aurora-A alsonegatively regulates the expression of BRCA2. We infer from these results that RAS-drivenmalignancy is modulated by Aurora-A and BRCA2.Aurora-A and BRCA2 regulates cell cycle progression and tumor growth of RAS-transformed cellsSince Aurora-A and BRCA2 participate in cell cycle regulation which controls ovariantumorigenesis, we detected the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry (Figure 1E).Introduction of RAS or Aurora-A in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells promotedcell cycle progression by increasing cell population in S phase and downregulating cellpopulation in G0/G1 phase as compared with these in control cells. In constrast,overexpression of BRCA2 or knockdown of Aurora-A in RAS-transformed cells promotedcell arrest at G0/G1 phase and reduced cells in S phase as compared with these in controlcells.To test whether Aurora-A and BRCA2 affect ovarian tumor growth, we injected RAS-transformed T29H or T80H cells overexpressing BRCA2 into nude mice and comparedtumor growth to that in mice receiving vector control cells. No tumors were observed in anyof the mice injected with BRCA2-transfected T29H and T80H cells, while all the miceinjected with vector control cells experienced rapid tumor growth within 4\u20137 weeks (Figure1F\u2013G), indicating that the expression of BRCA2 completely blocked tumor formation of theRAS-transformed cells. In addition, when ectopic Aurora-A expression was induced inimmortalized nontumorigenic T29 and T80 cells, subcutaneous tumor growth resultedYang et al. Page 5Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript(Figure 1H\u2013I), whereas shRNA-induced knockdown of Aurora-A in RAS-transformed cellsreduced or delayed tumor growth, compared with tumor growth in control cells expressingGFPi (Figure 1J\u2013K). Taken together, the above data demonstrated that Aurora-A andBRCA2 play opposite roles in RAS-associated tumor formation in vivo.Unbalanced expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 in cancer cells and tissues with RAS/RAFmutationsSince the above results were derived from RAS-transformed ovarian surface epithelial cells,we set out to confirm the results in a panel of cells including normal ovarian surfaceepithelial (OSE) cells, ovarian cancer cells, and pancreatic cancer cells harboring KRASmutations. We detected higher expression of BRCA2 and lower expression of Aurora-A inOSE 151 cells (Figure 2A), a normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell line described inour previous report 25, but lower BRCA2 and higher Aurora-A in the ovarian cancer celllines HOC-7 and HEY with confirmed mutations in KRAS (SFigure 1) and in the pancreaticcancer cell line CAPAN-1, which has a reported KRAS mutation and a truncated BRCA2mutation (Figure 2A). Furthermore, knockdown of Aurora-A by shRNA in HEY cells andintroduction of BRCA2 in CAPAN-1 cells resulted in decreased Aurora-A expression andincreased BRCA2 expression (Figure 2A).The above results also suggested the possibility that Aurora-A and BRCA2 are negativelyregulated in ovarian cancer, particularly in low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas and ovarianborderline tumors with KRAS/BRAF mutations. Thus, we selected tumor tissue samplesfrom 22 cases diagnosed with low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and borderline tumorwith or without identified KRAS/BRAF mutations and detected Aurora-A and BRCA2expression by immunostaining. We measured high expression of Aurora-A and lowexpression of BRCA2 in 6 of 10 (60%) samples with RAS/RAF mutations (P = 0.018, two-tailed Pearson\u2019s correlation), but high expression of BRCA2 and low expression of Aurora-A in 8 of 12 (66.7%) samples without KRAS/BRAF mutations (P = 0.023, two-tailedPearson\u2019s correlation) (Table 2). No statistical differences in Aurora-A and BRCA2expression were found in samples with low-grade serous carcinoma and in those withborderline tumor or between samples with KRAS mutation and those with BRAF mutation.Representative images are shown in Figure 2B.Farnesyl protein transferase \u03b2 (FT\u03b2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3(IGFBP-3) mediate the regulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 in RAS-associated cancer cellsSince IGFBP-3 was reported to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, which thereby blocksRAS cleavage 4. We measured the expression of IGFBP-3 and farnesyl protein transferase ina panel of ovarian cell lines. We found that the expression of IGFBP-3 was decreased inT29H and T29/Aurora-A cells compared with vector control cells, but was increased byectopic introduction of BRCA2 in T29H and Capan-1 cells, and by disruption of Aurora-Ain HEY cells compared with in their corresponding control cells (Figure 3A). In contrast, theexpression of farnesyl protein transferase \u03b2 (FT\u03b2 (but not FT\u03b1, data not shown) wasincreased in RAS- and Aurora-A-transformed cells (T29H and T29/Aurora-A), butdecreased in BRCA2-transfected cells (T29H/BRCA2, Capan-1/BRCA2) and Aurora-AshRNA-treated cells (HEY/Aurora-Ai) compared with in their controls. These changes ledto corresponding increases or decreases in RAS farnesylation (Figure 3A). These resultssuggest that transformation of ovarian epithelial cells by RAS or Aurora-A can inhibitIGFBP-3, leading to an increased expression of FT\u03b2, which may in turn promote RASfarnesylation and ovarian tumorigenesis. They also suggest that the restoration of BRCA2expression by silencing Aurora-A or introducing BRCA2 induces IGFBP-3 overexpression,which inhibits the activity of FT\u03b2, leading to reduced farnesylation of RAS, which may inturn decrease ovarian tumor formation.Yang et al. Page 6Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptTo confirm that IGFBP-3 is able to suppress FT\u03b2 expression, we transfected T29 andSKOV3 (an ovarian cancer cell line) cells with either IGFBP-3 cDNA or IGFBP-3 shRNA.As shown in Figure 3B, overexpression of IGFBP-3 reduced FT\u03b2 in T29 cells, whereassilencing of IGFBP-3 increased FT\u03b2 in T29 and SKOV3 cells compared with in their controlcells. Quantification data of FT\u03b2 and IGFBP-3 expression with ImageJ software was shownin SFigure 2. These results suggest that IGFBP-3 is involved in regulation of Aurora-A andBRCA2 through FT\u03b2 in terms of farnesylation of RAS. To strengthen evidence for thisnotion, we treated HEY and T29K (KRASV12-transformed T29 cells) with FT\u03b2-specificsiRNA or with FTI-276, which specifically inhibits farnesyl protein transferases activity 30.As shown in Figure 3C, treatment with FT\u03b2-specific siRNA reduced the farnesylation ofKRAS and Aurora-A expression, which is consistent with a recent report 31, but increasedBRCA2 expression compared with control siRNA-treated cells at the same time point.Moreover, treatment of HEY and T29K cells with FTI-276 yielded the same results as thosefrom treatment with FT\u03b2 siRNA (Figure 3D). These data suggest that FT\u03b2 not only regulatesRAS by farnesylation, but also controls the expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through amechanism that may be associated with IGFBP-3.Aurora-A and BRCA2 regulate chromosomal instability through dysregulated cytokinesisAmplification of Aurora-A and inactivation of BRCA2 are known to be closely associatedwith chromosomal instability. By analyzing chromosomal aberrations, as expected, theproportion of polyploid cells was markedly higher in RAS- and Aurora-A\u2013transformed cellsthan in control cells, and the knockdown of Aurora-A or introduction of BRCA2 in RAS-transformed cells resulted in less polyploidy in the experimental cell lines than in the controllines (Table 1, Figure 3E). In addition, the overall chromosome aberration was increased incells overexpressing RAS or Aurora-A compared with in control cells; however, the ectopicexpression of BRCA2 or silencing of Aurora-A in the transformed cells decreased theoverall chromosome aberration. These results demonstrate that dysregulation of Aurora-Aand BRCA2 led to chromosomal instability in RAS-transformed cells.Cytokinesis occurs during the last step of mitosis at which point a cell divides into twodaughter cells. Abnormal cytokinesis usually results in cell multinuclearity and eventuallyinduces chromosomal instability. Since Aurora-A and BRCA2 are involved in regulatingcytokinesis 32, 33, we examined the expression of both Aurora-A and BRCA2 in themidbody of late mitotic T29, T29H, and T29/Aurora-A cells. In immortalized T29/vectorcells, BRCA2 and Aurora-A co-localized at the midbody during the late stage of mitosis(Figure 3F). The transformation of T29 cells by RAS or Aurora-A diminished thelocalization of BRCA2 and increased the accumulation of Aurora-A in the midbody ascompared with T29/vector cells. Counts of cells with two or more nuclei showed that thetransformation by RAS or Aurora-A induced at least four times as many as were induced intheir control cells (Figure 3G). In normal ovarian epithelial cells (OSE151), Aurora-A andBRCA2 were co-localized at the midbody, while BRCA2 was undetectable in the midbodyof mitotic HOC-7, HEY, and Capan-1 cells with KRAS mutations (Figure 4A-C). However,knockdown of Aurora-A or introduction of BRCA2 in HEY or Capan-1 cells restoredBRCA2 accumulation in the midbody (Figure 4B-C). Consistent with the results from T29,T29H, and T29/Aurora-A cells, there were fewer OSE151 cells with multinuclearity thanHOC-7 cells, and the number of HEY/GFPi and Capan-1/vector cells with multinuclearitywas greater than HEY/Aurora-Ai and Capan-1/BRCA2 cells (Figure 4D). These resultssuggest that RAS mutations can diminish BRCA2 and enhance Aurora-A expression in themidbody during cytokinesis, which results in cell multinuclearity and genomic instability inhuman ovarian cancer cells as well as pancreatic cancer cells.Yang et al. Page 7Int J Cancer. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 15.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptDiscussionUsing RAS-transformed ovarian surface epithelial cells as a model system in this study, wehave identified a negative regulatory loop between Aurora-A and BRCA2, which aredownstream targets of RAS. We showed that RAS transformation of ovarian epithelial cellscan induce amplification of Aurora-A and simultaneously repress BRCA2 expression, whichwas also observed in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer tissues with RAS/RAFmutations. Aurora-A and BRCA2 oppositely regulated RAS-induced genomic instability inRAS-mutated cells through abnormal cytokinesis. In normal or immortalized ovarianepithelial cells, Aurora-A and BRCA2 are co-localized at the midbody during late mitosis, inwhich BRCA2 and Aurora-A may control the segregation of two daughter cells throughregulation of cytokinesis and prevent the generation of polyploid cells. A model on howAurora-A and BRCA2 function in RAS mutated cancer is illustrated in Figure 4E. Uponactivation by the RAS oncogene, which tips the balance toward Aurora-A, the diminishedexpression of BRCA2 and the accumulation of Aurora-A in the midbody may hamper theabscission of cleavage furrow to induce polyploidy or aneuploidy, which ultimately resultsin cellular genomic instability and tumorigenesis.Cytokinesis is the last important step of cell division where identical eukaryotic daughtercells finally separate. The association of cancer with abnormal cytokinesis has beenfrequently reported over the past 20 years. The proteins that regulate or participate inabnormal cytokinesis in cancer cells include kinases (such as Aurora-A, Aurora-B, andPLK1), mitotic checkpoint proteins (such as ATM, CHK1, and CHK2), mitotic regulators(such as BRCA1 and centrobin) 34. One of the phenomena induced by abnormal cytokinesisis multinuclearity leading to chromosomal polyploidy or aneuploidy 35, which largelycontributes to genomic instability and tumorigenesis 36. Both Aurora-A and BRCA2 are cellcycle regulatory proteins participating in cellular mitosis 37, 38. We have identified in thisstudy that Aurora-A and BRCA2 are two mediators that co-localize at the midbody of latemitotic cells to control the genomic instability of cells which is regulated by mutated RASoncogene. We and other research groups have found that BRCA2 is involved in regulationof cytokinesis 32, 39, although a recent study reported that BRCA2 may not regulatecytokinesis in Hela cells 40, indicating that the role of BRCA2 in regulation of cytokenesis issophisticated. It is interesting to note that no RAS or BRCA2 mutations in Hela cells werereported, but the amplification of RAS or Aurora-A has been observed in someliteratures 41, 42. Therefore, it is possible that mutated RAS may be essential to defectivecytokinesis through altering the expression ratio of Aurora-A and BRCA2.Our results demonstrated that FT\u03b2 and IGFBP-3 plays an important role in mediating theeffect to RAS to Aurora-A and BRCA2. The two proteins appear to form an negativeregulatory loop to repress the expression of each other; such negative loop plays animportant role in regulating the expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 and the chromosomalinstability induced by RAS. However, whether the interaction of FT\u03b2 and IGFBP-3 couldregulate chromosomal instability without directly involving RAS, Aurora-A, and BRCA2 isunknown, although it has been reported that FT\u03b2-stimulated farnesylation can increase RASactivity, and RAS-induced MAPK activation can lead to resistance of breast cancer cells toIGFBP-3 43. It is known that RAS mutations or Aurora-A amplification can activate the NF-\u03baB which is involved in regulating the expression of FT\u03b2 and IGFBP-3 44\u201346, therefore, itwill be very interesting to examine the role of NF-\u03baB in the regulation of FT\u03b2 and IGFBP-3and RAS-mediated transformation.Currently, there are no reports to show that Aurora-A can regulate BRCA2, however, as akinase in cancer cells, over expression of Aurora-A may phosphorylate BRCA2 and result inproteasome-mediated degradation during the late stage of mitosis, leading to abnormalYang et al.

Moreover, emerging evidences suggest that both Aurora-A and BRCA2 can beregulated by various factors during cell cycle by proteolysis-mediated degradation. Studieshave demonstrated that BRCA2 can interact with multiple gene products such as USP11 (adeubiquitinating enzyme) 47, Skp2 (a subunit of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein ubiquitincomplex) 48, and cancer associated BRAD1 beta 49, leading to its proteasome-mediatedubiquitination and degradation in different cancer cells. Polyubiquitination of Aurora-A byanaphase-promoting complex (APC), or Cdh1 (a WD40 repeat protein) can promote theproteasome-mediated degradation of Aurora-A 50. Thus, we treated T29 and T29/Aurora-Acells with proteosome inhibitor MG-132 at the concentration of 10\u03bcM and found that theincreased full length of Aurora-A and BRCA2 was accompanied with the decreaseddegradation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 over a time course of 1, 4, and 8 hours (SFigure 3).However, the detailed regulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 by proteolysis mediatedubiquitination and degradation in cells with RAS mutations will require additional studies.As RAS/Aurora-A is amplified in multiple epithelial cancers, the molecules we identified inthis study should have a general implication in clinical treatment of those cancers.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgmentsG.Y. is supported by Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China (20120071110079), by Shanghai PujiangProgram (11PJ1402200) from Shanghai Municipal Government of China, and by National Nature ScienceFoundation of China (91129721).J.L. is supported by an R01 grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (1R01CA131183-01A2) and by theSpecialized Programs of Research Excellence ovarian cancer research grant (IP50CA83638).

Theregulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 is mediated through insulin-like growth factorbinding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and farnesyl protein transferase beta (FT-beta) in thepresence of mutated RAS. As mutation or amplification of RAS/Aurora-A occurs inmultiple epithelial cancers, BRCA2, FT-\u03b2 and IGFBP-3 are likely essential targets to beconsidered in clinical treatment of those cancers.Yang et al.

Transformation of ovarian epithelial cells (T29) by RAS or Aurora-A represses IGFBP-3,but induces FT\u03b2 over expression in T29H and T29/Aurora-A cells compared with controlcells. However, introduction of BRCA2 cDNA or Aurora-A shRNA into T29H, Capan-1, orHEY cells resulted in increased IGFBP-3 and decreased FT\u03b2, which in turn reduced thefarnesylation of RAS. B. Introduction of IGFBP-3 cDNA or IGFBP-3 shRNA suppressed orincreased FT\u03b2 expression. C. Treatment of cells with FT\u03b2 siRNA reduced the expression ofFT\u03b2, RAS farnesylation and Aurora-A expression, but elevated BRCA2 protein level.
