MicroRNAs  (miRNAs)  can  act as  oncogenes  or tumor-suppressor  genes  in  human  malignancy.  ThemiR-34  family  is comprised  of  tumor-suppressive  miRNAs,  and  its  reduced  expression  by  methylationhas  been  reported  in  various  cancers,  including  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In  this  study,  weinvestigated  the alteration  and  tumor-suppressive  impact  of  miR-34s  in SCLC.  The  methylation  of  miR-34a and  miR-34b/c  was  observed  in  4 (36%)  and  7  (64%)  of  11  SCLC  cell  lines,  respectively.  Among  the  27SCLC  clinical  specimens,  miR-34a  and  miR-34b/c  were  methylated  in  4  (15%)  and  18  (67%),  respectively.In  contrast,  13  (28%)  miR-34a  methylated  cases  and  12  (26%)  miR-34b/c  methylated  cases  were foundin  47  NSCLC  primary  tumors.  The  frequency  of  miR-34b/c  methylation  was  significantly  higher  in  SCLCthan  in  NSCLC  (p  <  0.001).

Because  the  frequency  of  methylation  was  higher  in miR-34b/c,  wefocused  on  miR-34b/c  for a  functional  analysis.  We  examined  the  effect  of  miR-34b/c  introduction  oncell  proliferation,  migration  and  invasion.  The  transfection  of  miR-34b/c  to two  SCLC cell  lines  (H1048and  SBC5)  resulted  in  the  significant  inhibition  of  cell  growth,  migration,  and  invasion,  compared  withcontrol  transfectants.

IntroductionLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death inhe world at present. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggres-ive tumor with a dismal prognosis among primary lung cancersnd accounts for approximately 13% of all lung cancers [1,2].hemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is generally the treatmentf choice for SCLC patients because the clinical features of SCLCnclude a high rate of metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organseginning at an early stage. A strong initial response but earlycquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a unique featuref SCLC [3,4], resulting in a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival ratef only 5% [5].  Thus, the development of new therapeutic strategiess mandatory.\u2217 Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 86 235 7265; fax: +81 86 235 7269.E-mail address: toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp (S.

All rights reserved.The understanding of molecular pathogenesis is crucial for thedevelopment of new therapeutic strategies for malignant tumors.Of note, the profile of molecular alterations is quite different amongthe histological subtypes of lung cancer [6\u20138]. For example, epider-mal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations [9],  K-ras mutationsand P16 methylation [8] are frequently found in non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), but not in SCLC [10]. In contrast, TP53 mutations[8,11] or RASSF1A methylation [12] is frequently found in SCLC,compared with NSCLC. These results indicate that the molecularpathogenesis differs between SCLC and NSCLC.Many studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can act asoncogenes or tumor suppressors and that the widespread alter-ation of miRNA expression patterns is highly relevant to varioushuman malignancies [13]. In lung cancer, the reduced expressionof let-7 [14] or the overexpression of miR-155 [15] is reportedlycorrelated with the clinical outcome of NSCLC. Among the miRNAs,miRNA-34 (miR-34) family members reportedly play importanttumor-suppressive roles, as they are directly regulated by p53 anddx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002http://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcanmailto:toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jpdx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002g Cancigwmoamtieoaifpio22NStUwnorbrnilH(NHNNHHc,Ul(IwsimiwwdtcdmN. Tanaka et al. / Lunompose the p53 network [16]. The members of the miR-34 fam-ly consist of three miRNAs (miR-34a, 34b and 34c), the targetenes of which are considered to be similar to one another butith some notable differences [17]. miR-34a is located on chro-osome 1q36.22, while miR-34b and 34c (miR-34b/c) are locatedn chromosome 11q23 and are generated by the processing of single transcript [17]. A previous study indicated that miR-34ethylation was present in NSCLC and was significantly relatedo an unfavorable clinical outcome [18]. In a functional analysis thentroduction of miR-34b/c into NSCLC suppressed the cell prolif-ration of NSCLC [19]. However, these studies examining the rolesf miRNA in lung cancer have been mainly performed for NSCLC,nd miRNA alterations and their impact on SCLC have not beennvestigated.In this study, we investigated miR-34 methylation in SCLC andound that miR-34b/c was frequently methylated in SCLC, com-ared with NSCLC. Subsequently, we investigated the biologicalmpact of miR-34b/c methylation on SCLC to understand the rolef miR-34b/c in the tumorigenesis of SCLC.. Materials and methods.1. Clinical samples and cell linesA total of lung cancer specimens comprising 12 SCLC, 47SCLC resected tumors, and 15 malignant pleural effusions inCLC patients were retrieved from Okayama University Hospi-al, Okayama, Japan and NHO Yamaguchi-Ube Medical Center,be, Yamaguchi, Japan. Each resected tumor was  not treatedith preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Correspondingon-malignant tissue (peripheral lung or bronchial epithelium)f resected tumors were also available. Fifteen malignant pleu-al effusions were obtained from 8 patients who were treatedy chemotherapy or radiotherapy and 7 patients who  were noteceived any treatment. All the specimens were frozen with liquiditrogen immediately after surgery and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C. Writtennformed consents were obtained from all the patients at two  col-ection sites.Eleven SCLC cell lines [NCI-H1048 (H1048), SBC5, HCC33, NCI-211 (H211), NCI-H524 (H524), NCI-H841 (H841), NCI-H1688H1688), NCI-H1870 (H1870), NCI-H2141 (H2141), NCI-H82 (H82),CI-H249 (H249)] and 14 NSCLC cell lines [PC-9, HCC827, NCI-1975 (H1975), NCI-H3255 (H3255), A549, NCI-H1395 (H1395),CI-H522 (H522), NCI-H838 (H838), HCC15, NCI-H125 (H125),CI-H460 (H460), NCI-H661 (H661), NCI-H1299 (H1299), NCI-358 (H358)] were used in this study. We  also investigated theBEC 5KT cell, established from non-malignant human bronchialells. Cell lines whose prefix is NCI-H- (abbreviated as H-) or HCC- and HBEC 5KT were kindly provided by Dr. Adi F. Gazdar (Theniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dal-as, TX). SBC5 was obtained from Drs. M.  Tanimoto and K. KiuraOkayama University, Okayama, Japan). PC-9 was obtained frommmuno-Biological Laboratories (Takasaki, Gunma, Japan). A549as obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manas-as, VA). All the cell lines except for HBEC 5KT were maintainedn RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)  supple-ented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 \u25e6Cn a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HBEC 5KT cell lineas maintained in Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)ith bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and human recombinant epi-ermal growth factor (EGF). H82, H249, H1048, and SBC5 werereated with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at aoncentration of 5\u201310 \ufffdM for 6 days, with medium changes onays 1, 3, and 5, to restore gene expression that was reduced byethylation.cer 76 (2012) 32\u2013 38 332.2. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) assayGenomic DNA was  extracted from cell lines and tissues by stan-dard phenol\u2013chloroform (1:1) extraction or by DNeasy Tissue Kit(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was  subjected to bisulfate treatmentusing the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research Corp.,Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For malig-nant pleural effusions, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAampCirculating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) and bisulfite conversion wasperformed using Epitect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol. The methylation statuses of miR-34a and34b/c were determined by MSP  assay using specific primers forthe methylated and unmethylated forms [20]. The DNA from HBEC5KT was  treated with SssI methyltransferase (New England BioLabs,Beverly, MA)  and was used as a positive control for methylated alle-les. PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels and stained withethidium bromide.2.3. miR-34s expression by quantitative RT-PCRThe miRNA was isolated from cell lines and tissue speci-mens with TaqMan MicroRNA Cells-to-CTTM Kit (Ambion, Austin,TX) and mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) and treatedwith DNase I (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. Reverse tran-scriptional (RT) reaction was  performed for extracted 0.5 \ufffdgmiRNA with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcriptional Kit sys-tems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan singleRT primers for each miRNA (Applied Biosystems). The quantita-tive RT-PCR for miR-34a, 34b, and 34c using TaqMan MicroRNAAssays technology (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA) with theStep One Plus Real Time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems). ThemiR-374 expression was  used to normalize the expression ofmiR-34s as endogenous control of cell lines following manu-facturer\u2019s recommendation (www.appliedbiosystems.com). Afternormalization of miR-34s expression to miR-374, all relativeexpression values were defined as the ratios of the normalizedmiR-34s expression value of cell lines or primary tumors to thatof HBEC 5KT or individual non-malignant lung tissue, respec-tively.2.4. Immunohistochemistry for p53 expressionAbnormality of p53 expression was examined using immuno-histochemistry for primary tumors. To detect the p53 protein, weused a monoclonal antibody against human p53 (DAKO-p53, DAKO,Denmark). The routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tis-sue blocks were sectioned at a 4 \ufffdm thickness. They were stainedby hematoxylin and eosin stain to confirm the presence andintensity of tumor cells and processed for immunohistochemistry(IHC). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydratedwith graded ethanol, and immersed in Tris\u2013buffered saline forIHC. For p53 scoring, more than 10 randomly chosen high powerfields were evaluated under an optical microscope and a trainedpathologist was defined blindly scored. In this study, p53 muta-tional status was  defined as positive when more than 15% of cellswere positive regardless of the intensity as previously reported[21,22].2.5. Plasmid construction and gene transfectionThe miR-34b/c or scramble fragment as control was subclonedinto pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Plasmid Vector (Ambion). Four \ufffdg ofpSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Vector was  introduced into SCLC cell linesusing LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). For experimentsof transient transfection, cells were collected 72 h after the trans-fection.

Colony formation assay for cell proliferationThe in vitro cell proliferation was tested by liquid colony for-ation assay. Fifty viable cells were plated onto 6-well platesn triplicate. Cells were cultured and counted 14 days later aftertaining with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 5 min  atoom temperature. The number of visible colonies (>50 cells) wasounted..7. Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were established using aoyden chamber assay with filter inserts (pore size, 8 \ufffdm)  in-well plates (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA).he cells in 2 ml  serum-free RPMI1640 medium (300 \ufffdl contain-ng 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells for transwell migration assay and 5 \u00d7 105 foratrigel invasion assay) were added to the top chamber. Theottom chamber was prepared with 10% FBS as a chemoattrac-ant. Non-invasive cells were removed by scrubbing with a cottonwab after 24\u201348 and 48\u201396 h of incubation for migration assaynd invasion assay, respectively. The cells that had migratedhrough the membrane and stuck to the lower surface of theembrane were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik stain (Sysmex,obe, Japan). For quantification of migration and invasion, the cellsere counted under a microscope in 5 predetermined fields at100 magnifications representing the average of 3 independentxperiments..8. Western blot analysisCells were grown to 80% confluency and harvested in lysisuffer [20 mmol/L Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/La2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophos-hate, 1 mmol/L \ufffd-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 \ufffdg/mleupeptin] (Cell signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)  supplementedith Complete, Mini (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to extract protein.otal 30 \ufffdg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferredo PVDF membranes. The proteins on membranes were incubatedvernight at 4 \u25e6C with the primary antibodies. We  selected twoolecules (c-MET and CDK6). The primary antibodies for Westernlotting are as follows: anti-MET (25H2, Cell Signaling), anti-hospho-MET (3D7, Tyr1234/1235; Cell Signaling), and anti-CDK6DCS83, Cell Signaling). The following secondary antibodies weresed: goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradisheroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz). To detect specific signals, the mem-ranes were detected by ECL plus Western Blotting Detectioneagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Buckinghamshire,K)..9. Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Win-ows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All of the in vitroxperiments were performed at least three times. Data wereepresented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance ofhe differences between two groups was determined using thehi-square test and the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate. 5% significance level (p < 0.05) was considered statisticallyignificant.ination with normal cells.

Methylation and expression status of miR-34sWe examined the methylation frequencies of miR-34a and b/cin 11 SCLC cell lines, 27 clinical samples consisting of 12 primarytumors and 15 malignant pleural effusions. Usefulness of malignantpleural effusions to detect DNA methylation has been previouslyreported [23]. For comparison purposes, the methylation frequen-cies of miR-34a and b/c were also examined in 14 NSCLC celllines and 47 primary tumors. Representative images of the elec-trophoresis results are shown in Fig. 1. MSP  of the cell lines showedthree PCR band patterns: only a methylated band, both a methy-lated and an unmethylated band, and only a methylated band. Thepresence of both methylated and unmethylated bands indicatedpartial methylation. In this study, cell lines with partial methyla-tion were classified as methylated cell lines. The methylation ofmiR-34a and miR-34b/c was  observed in 4 (36%) and 7 (64%) out of11 SCLC cell lines, respectively. Among the 27 SCLC clinical speci-mens, miR-34a and miR-34b/c were methylated in 4 (15%) and 18(67%), respectively. Stratified by specimens, miR-34a methylationwas  found in 3 of 12 SCLC tumors and 1 of 15 malignant pleuraleffusions and miR-34b/c methylation was found in 9 of 12 tumorsand 9 of 15 malignant pleural effusions. There was no significantdifference in frequency of methylation between resected tumorsand malignant pleural effusion specimens. In addition, no signifi-cant difference was found in the frequencies of miR-34 methylationbetween previously treated 8 pleural effusions (0% in miR-34a and75% in miR-34b/c) and 7 pleural effusions without any treatment(14% in miR-34a and 57% in miR-34b/c), respectively. Among theNSCLC tumors, miR-34a and miR-34b/c methylation were observedN. Tanaka et al. / Lung Cancer 76 (2012) 32\u2013 38 35F p-miRf tive coeitst3lu(atovvtlcc3Tpmisb3t3HdvmadDAtig. 2.

The frequency of miR-34b/c methylation wasignificantly higher among the SCLC primary tumors than amonghe NSCLC samples (p < 0.001)..2. Relationship between methylation and expression in SCLCThe expressions of miR-34a, 34b, and 34c in 11 SCLC cellines and 6 available SCLC primary tumors (4 methylated and 2nmethylated cases) were examined using quantitative RT-PCRTables 1 and 2). The expression values of the miR-34s were defineds the ratio of the normalized expression value of SCLC cell lineso that of HBEC 5KT and that of the primary SCLC tumors to thatf individual non-malignant lung tissue with arbitrarily assignedalues of 1, respectively. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, all expressionalues of miR-34s in SCLC cell lines and primary tumors were lowerhan their normal control samples (HBEC 5KT and non-malignantung tissue). The expressions of the miR-34b and 34c were signifi-antly lower in the methylated cell lines than in the unmethylatedell lines (miR-34b, p = 0.011; miR-34c, p = 0.008). Regarding miR-4a, no significant difference or tendency was detected (p = 0.107).his finding may  reflect the small sample sizes or the presence ofartially methylated cells. One cell line (H2141) with unmethylatediR-34a had very low expression value (0.05) for miR-34a, suggest-ng the presence of an alternative mechanism for gene silencing.We  also treated 4 cell lines with DAC and found that the expres-ions of the miR-34s were restored in the methylated SCLC cell linesut not in the unmethylated cell lines (Table 3)..3. p53 status in SCLCp53 is a transcriptional factor for miR-34s. Thus, we examinedhe correlation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-4s (Table 2). Genotyping data for the TP53 gene in H1048, SBC5,211, H524, H841, H2141, H82, and H249 were queried from theatabase of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)ersion 15 (www-p53.iarc.fr) to find that all cell lines harbor TP53utation. HCC33 and H1870 also harbor mutation (HCC33, C242Ynd H1870, Y234C) and these data were provided by Dr. Adi F. Gaz-ar (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas,allas, TX, USA). The mutation status of H1688 was not available.s a result, 10 out of 11 cell lines were found to carry TP53 muta-ions. The p53 status of the primary tumors was determined using-34b/c) or control (p-scramble) plasmid vectors. (A) Representative results of colonylony formation efficiencies are presented. Shown are means of three replications;immunohistochemistry [21,22].  The aberrant positive expressionof p53 protein was regarded as a p53 abnormality (mutation) inthe primary cancers. Four (67%) out of the 6 primary SCLC tumorsexhibited positive p53 immunohistochemistry results suggestingthe presence of p53 mutation. The relationship between the p53alterations and the expressions of miR-34s was examined, but nocorrelation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-34swas  found.3.4. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell proliferationBecause the frequency of methylation was higher in miR-34b/cand because miR-34a methylation in SCLC cell lines was mainlypartial methylation but miR-34b/c was heavily methylation, wefocused on miR-34b/c for a functional analysis. For this purpose, weestablished stable transfectants with miR-34b/c and scramble con-trols for H1048 and SBC5. To examine the anti-proliferative effectof miR-34b/c induction, we  performed a colony formation assayfor stable transfectants. Cell proliferation was significantly inhib-ited in the SCLC cells transfected with miR-34b/c, compared withthat in the cells that were transfected with a scramble control (50%inhibition for H1048, p = 0.001; 44% for SBC5, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).3.5. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell migration and invasionTo estimate the effect of introducing miR-34b/c on the migrationand invasion potential of SCLC, cell migration and invasion poten-tial were examined using a Boyden chamber. Microscopy imagesof the Boyden chamber assay are shown in Fig. 3. Migration andinvasion were significantly suppressed in miR-34b/c transfectants,compared with control transfectants (migration: 50% inhibition forH1048, p = 0.051; 54% for SBC5, p = 0.044; invasion: 33% inhibitionfor H1048, p = 0.002; 30% inhibition for SBC5, p = 0.012).3.6. Protein expression of stable transfectantsTo examine the effect of miR-34b/c introduction, we focusedon c-MET (both total and phosphorylated types) and CDK6 whichwere the putative target of miR-34b/c. Western blotting was  carriedout in SCLC stable transfectants. Total and phosphorylated c-METand CDK6 expressions were down-regulated in the SCLC cell linesexamined.

DiscussionIn this study, we found that miR-34b/c methylation was a fre-uent alteration of SCLC. As a result, miR-34b/c expression waseduced in SCLC, causing tumor cell proliferation and invasive-ess. Our results also indicated that miR-34b/c methylation is thearly event for tumorigenesis of SCLC because there was  no differ-nce in frequency between surgically resected tumors supposedo be early stage and malignant pleural effusions considered toe advanced stage. In addition to lung cancer, miR-34b/c methy-ation has been reported in various kinds of malignant tumorsncluding colorectal and ovarian cancers [20,24].  We  previouslyeported the methylation and function of miR-34b/c in malignantleural mesothelioma [25]; the same established methodology waslso used in the present study. p53 is a transcriptional factor foriR-34s. The p53 mutation has been reported in various cancers,ncluding lung cancer. However, the effect of p53 mutation on thexpression and methylation of miR-34b/c remains uncertain. Invarian cancer, miR-34a methylation and p53 mutation are notssociated.

In addition, p53 mutation has no effect on miR-34b/cmethylation in ovarian cancer [24]. In the SCLC cell lines that wereexamined in the present study, 10 out of 11 cell lines carried ap53 mutation, but the expression levels of the miR-34s varied andwere correlated with the methylation status. In primary tumors,while the p53 mutational status was  determined using immuno-histochemistry [21,22], the relationship among the expression andmethylation of miR-34b/c and p53 mutation was similar to thatin the cell lines. Our data suggest that miR-34 expression was notcompletely silenced in the p53-altered cases and that methylationmay  contribute more strongly to the expressions of miR-34s.Antitumor effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation,migration, and invasion, were observed with the introduction ofmiR-34b/c. In general, miRNA has multiple target mRNAs, and c-Met  is a well-known target molecule of miR-34b/c [16,17]. c-Metand its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been shown tobe involved in cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis [26,27].A previous study found that the c-Met/HGF pathway was  func-tional in SCLC, indicating in vitro that the c-MET/HGF axis mayFold change after DACmiR-34a miR-34b miR-34c1.2 3.9 279.83.8 1.9 20.51.1 4.2 52.61.8 2.8 2.2-34b/c expression in SCLC cell lines with methylation after 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidineAC-treated cell lines compared with the miR-34s expression values in non-treatedN.

Our results, together withhose of previous reports, strongly suggest that miR-34b/c playsn important role in the pathogenesis of SCLC and may  be a usefulherapeutic target for SCLC.In SCLC, the methylation of miR-34a was not a frequent eventompared with that of miR-34b/c, but its expression was  lowompared with that in non-malignant lung tissue. The degree ofeduction in miR-34a expression was similar to that of miR-34b/cn some SCLC cell lines, suggesting that miR-34a silencing may  alsoe involved in the pathogenesis of SCLC, although the mechanismig. 4.

The quantitative values expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of five microscopicof silencing has not been clearly elucidated. Further study on therole of miR-34a in SCLC is warranted.In conclusion, our findings showed that miR-34b/c is morefrequently methylated in SCLC than in NSCLC, resulting in thedown-regulation of miR-34b/c. As this alteration confers a growthand invasion advantage to cancer cells, targeting miR-34b/c is apotential therapeutic option for the treatment of SCLCs. The tar-geting of SCLCs is of particular interest, as recent trials of targeteddrugs for lung cancer have focused mainly on NSCLCs.Conflict of interest statementNone declared.AcknowledgementWe  thank Adi F.
