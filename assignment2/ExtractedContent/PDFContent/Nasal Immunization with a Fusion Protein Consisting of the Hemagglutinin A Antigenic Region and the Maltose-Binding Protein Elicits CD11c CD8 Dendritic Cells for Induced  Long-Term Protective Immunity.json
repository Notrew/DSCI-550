Nasal immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induced highlevels of 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA antibodies in a Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4)-dependent manner. These antibody responses were maintained for at least 1 year after immunization.Analysis of cytokine responses showed that nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP induced antigen-specificCD4\ufffd T cells producing interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-5, but not gamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd), in the spleen andcervical lymph nodes (CLNs). Furthermore, increased numbers of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd, but not CD11c\ufffd CD11b\ufffdor CD11c\ufffd B220\ufffd, dendritic cells with upregulated expression of CD80, CD86, CD40, and major histocom-patibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules were noted in the spleen, CLNs, and nasopharynx-associatedlymphoreticular tissues (NALT). Interestingly, when 25k-hagA-MBP or cholera toxin (CT) was given intra-nasally to enable examination of their presence in neuronal tissues, the amounts of 25k-hagA-MBP weresignificantly lower than those of CT. Importantly, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP nasally showed a significantreduction in alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P. gingivalis, even 1 year after the immunization.These results suggest that 25k-hagA-MBP administered nasally would be an effective and safe mucosal vaccineagainst P. gingivalis infection and may be an important tool for the prevention of chronic periodontitis inhumans.Chronic periodontitis is a common oral inflammatory dis-ease that causes the breakdown of periodontal tissues, includ-ing resorption of alveolar bone and tooth loss (7). Further-more, recent studies have demonstrated that periodontitis ismuch more than a localized oral infection: it may cause ad-verse changes in systemic physiology, such as cardiovasculardisease, diabetes, and osteoporosis (2, 9, 15, 23, 28, 38, 39, 45).Hence, prevention of periodontitis is important for both oraland systemic health.Subgingival Gram-negative bacteria are associated with theonset and progression of chronic periodontitis; populations ofa few opportunistic pathogens, including Porphyromonas gin-givalis, are increased during development from a healthy site toa diseased site (7, 22). Molecules such as fimbriae, aggregationfactors, lipopolysaccharides, and numerous proteolytic en-zymes responsible for colonization have been identified as vir-ulence factors (22, 37). Hemagglutinin, which is known to belocated on the cell surface and in vesicles of P. gingivalis, hasbeen proposed to mediate bacterial attachment to, and pene-tration of, host cells and may also agglutinate and lyse eryth-rocytes in order to take up heme, an absolute requirement forthe growth of the bacterium (6, 8, 41). Multiple hemagglutiningenes have been cloned from P. gingivalis by functional screen-ing (35, 42, 44, 49). Among these, hemagglutinin A (HagA) hasbeen thought to contain the functional domain of hemagglu-tinin and to be a potentially useful immunogen that elicits aprotective immune response against subsequent colonizationby P. gingivalis (30). The hagA gene is 7,887 bp long andencodes a protein of 2,628 amino acids, with a molecular massof 283.3 kDa (17). This gene has four large, contiguous directrepeats, and the repeat unit is believed to contain the hemag-glutinin domain (17). Previous studies have demonstrated themolecular cloning of a 200-kDa antigenic protein (200-k AP)from P. gingivalis and have shown that 200-k AP is identical toHagA (10, 19). Furthermore, the DNA sequence of a subcloneencoding the 25-kDa antigenic region of 200-k AP (25k-hagA)is identical to that of the first repeat of hagA (10). Thesestudies suggest that 25k-hagA may be a useful vaccine antigen(Ag) for the prevention of periodontitis caused by P. gingivalisinfection.Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a high-affinity maltose/maltodextrin-binding protein responsible for the capture andtransport of maltodextrins from the periplasmic space inGram-negative bacteria (4). MBP is used as a fusion partnerfor recombinant protein expression to improve the yield and to* Corresponding author.

Further-more, the stability and solubility of a passenger protein can beimproved by fusing it to MBP (12). Recently, MBP was used asa chaperone component in various vaccines and was shown toenhance antigen-specific immune responses (32, 46, 48, 51, 52).In this regard, a previous in vitro study has shown that MBPinduces dendritic cell (DC) activation and increases I\ufffd\ufffd phos-phorylation in treated cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation ofI\ufffd\ufffd is largely abrogated by the addition of antibodies againsttoll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (11). These findings suggest thatMBP stimulates DCs via TLR4, and this may account for theadjuvanticity of MBP.In the present study, we assessed the potential of a fusionprotein consisting of the 25-kDa antigenic region of P. gingi-valis HagA and MBP (25k-hagA-MBP) as a nasal vaccine forthe prevention of oral infection with P. gingivalis. The resultssuggest that nasal 25k-hagA-MBP is a practical, effective, andsafe vaccine candidate for the induction of protective immunityagainst alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice. BALB/c mice and Toll-like receptor 4 gene-disrupted (TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd)BALB/c mice were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Themice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the experimental facil-ity of the Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo. All mice wererandomly assigned to control or experimental groups of 4 to 6 mice each andwere provided ad libitum access to sterile food and water. They were used at theage of 8 to 12 weeks in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals (Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo).Antigen. Plasmid pMD157, encoding the 25k-hagA-MBP fusion protein, wasconstructed as described previously (25). Briefly, plasmid pMD101, encoding200-k AP (19), was partially digested with HaeIII, methylated, and ligated withEcoRI polylinkers. Plasmid vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,MA), which carries the MBP gene, was digested with EcoRI. Both digestedDNAs were ligated with T4 DNA ligase and were then transformed into Esch-erichia coli K-12 cells. The constructed clones were screened by Western blotanalysis with antibodies against recombinant 200-k AP and MBP. 25k-hagA-MBP and MBP-free 25k-hagA were purified to homogeneity utilizing amylaseresin affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs). The purity of the pro-teins was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis (SDS-PAGE), and no contaminating protein bands were noted.Furthermore, the possible presence of residual endotoxin in the preparationwas assessed with a Pyrochrome Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) kit (As-sociates of Cape Cod Inc., Woods Hole, MA). 25k-hagA-MBP and 25k-hagAcontained as little as 0.3 pg of endotoxin, which did not induce cell activationin vitro (data not shown). Cholera toxin (CT) was obtained from List Bio-logical Laboratories (Campbell, CA).Immunization and sample collection. Mice were immunized nasally on days 0,7, and 14 with a 10-\ufffdl aliquot (5 \ufffdl per nostril) of phosphate-buffered saline(PBS) containing 20 \ufffdg of either 25k-hagA, 25k-hagA-MBP, or MBP. In someexperiments, mice were given 20 \ufffdg of 25k-hagA plus 1 \ufffdg of CT (as a mucosaladjuvant) nasally. Serum and saliva samples were collected from each group, asdescribed elsewhere (56), in order to examine 25k-hagA-specific antibody re-sponses.Detection of antigen-specific antibody responses. Antibody titers in serum andsaliva were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).Briefly, plates were coated with 25k-hagA (5 \ufffdg/ml) or a sonicated extract of P.gingivalis (5 \ufffd 108 cells/ml) and were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovineserum albumin. After blocking, serial dilutions of serum or saliva samples wereadded in duplicate. The starting dilution of serum was 1:25, while that of salivawas 1:21. The plates were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, washed, andthen incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavychain \ufffd-, \ufffd1-, \ufffd2a-, \ufffd2b-, \ufffd3-, or \ufffd-specific antibodies (Southern BiotechnologyAssociates, Birmingham, AL) at 4\u00b0C for 20 h. Finally, 2,2\t-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) with H2O2 (Moss, Inc., Pasadena, MD) wasadded for color development. Endpoint titers were expressed as the reciprocallog2 of the last dilution giving an optical density at 415 nm of 0.1 greater than thatof nonimmunized control samples after 15 min of incubation.Assessment of antibody-forming cells. Single-cell suspensions were obtainedfrom the salivary gland 7 days after the last immunization. Briefly, salivary glandswere carefully excised, teased apart, and dissociated using 0.3 mg/ml collagenase(Nitta Gelatin Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in RPMI 1640 (Wako Pure ChemicalIndustries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Mononuclear cells were obtained at the interfaceof the 50% and 75% layers of a discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE HealthcareUK, Ltd., Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) (36). To assess numbers of antigen-specific antibody-forming cells, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assaywas performed as described previously (57). Briefly, 96-well nitrocellulose plates(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with 25k-hagA (5 \ufffdg/ml),incubated for 20 h at 4\u00b0C, and then washed extensively before being blocked withRPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 30 min, the blocking solutionwas discarded, and cell suspensions at various dilutions were added to wells andincubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 in moist air. The cells were washed andthen incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavychain \ufffd-specific antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates) at 4\u00b0C for 20 h.Following incubation, the plates were washed with PBS and were developed bythe addition to each well of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole dissolved in 0.1 M sodiumacetate buffer containing H2O2 (Moss). Plates were incubated at room temper-ature for 25 min and were washed with water, and antibody-forming cells werethen counted with the aid of a stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).25k-hagA-specific CD4\ufffd T cell responses. CD4\ufffd T cells from spleens andcervical lymph nodes (CLNs) were isolated 7 days after the last immunization byusing the IMag system (BD Biosciences) as described elsewhere (18). Briefly,mononuclear cells were mixed with anti-CD4 antibodies and were incubated at4\u00b0C for 30 min, after which CD4\ufffd T cells were separated using a magnet. Thepurity of CD4\ufffd T cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BDBiosciences) and was routinely 90%. The CD4\ufffd T cells (2.0 \ufffd 106/ml) werethen cultured with 5 \ufffdg/ml of 25k-hagA in the presence of T cell-depleted,mitomycin-treated splenic feeder cells (2.5 \ufffd 106 cells) in RPMI 1640 mediumsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 \ufffdM 2-mercaptoethanol, 15 mMHEPES, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 \ufffdg/ml of streptomycin, and 10 U/ml ofrecombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2). Cultures were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0Cunder 5% CO2 in air. To measure 25k-hagA-specific cell proliferation, 1.0 \ufffdCi of[3H]thymidine was added to the culture 18 h before harvesting, and incorporatedradioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Culture supernatants wereharvested after 5 days of incubation. The levels of IL-4, IL-5, and gammainterferon (IFN-\ufffd) in the culture supernatants were determined using commer-cially available assay kits (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) in accor-dance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.DC analysis. Dendritic cell (DC)-enriched cell populations were isolated fromspleens, CLNs, and nasopharynx-associated lymphoreticular tissues (NALT) 7days after the last immunization, as described previously (26). Briefly, lymphoidtissues were digested with collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,Germany) and DNase I (Roche) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetalbovine serum albumin, with continuous stirring at 37\u00b0C for 45 to 90 min. EDTAwas added (final concentration, 10 mM), and the cell suspension was incubatedfor an additional 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were spun through a 15.5% Accudenz(Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) solution to enrich forDCs. DC-enriched cell populations were analyzed for the expression of variouscell surface molecules by using fluorescence-labeled antibodies. The purity ofCD11c\ufffd cells was routinely 50%. Aliquots of mononuclear cells (0.2 \ufffd 106 to1.0 \ufffd 106 cells) isolated from various tissues were stained with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD80, CD86, CD40, or I-Admonoclonal antibodies; phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse CD11c monoclo-nal antibodies; and Alexa-labeled anti-mouse B220, CD11b, and CD8\ufffd mono-clonal antibodies (BD Biosciences). Samples were then subjected to fluores-cence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (BD Biosciences).Oral infection. Mice were orally infected with P. gingivalis as described previ-ously (1, 14, 33), with minor modifications. Briefly, mice were given ad libitumaccess to deionized water containing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Sulfatrim;Goldline Laboratories, Fort Lauderdale, FL) at 10 ml per pint for 10 days. Thiswas followed by a 3-day antibiotic-free period. Mice were then administered 109CFU of P. gingivalis suspended in 100 \ufffdl of PBS with 2% carboxymethylcellulosevia oral topical application. Mice were inoculated 5 times a week (from Mondayto Friday) for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 inoculations. Control groups includedsham-infected mice, which received antibiotic pretreatment and carboxymethyl-cellulose without P. gingivalis.Measurement of alveolar bone loss. Forty-seven days after the first gavage,mice were euthanized using CO2 for assessment of alveolar bone loss. Horizontalbone loss around the maxillary molars was assessed using a morphometricmethod as described previously (29). Briefly, skulls were defleshed after 10 minof treatment in boiling water under 15-lb/in2 pressure, immersed overnight in 3%896 DU ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.hydrogen peroxide, pulsed for 1 min in bleach, and stained with 1% methyleneblue. The distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bonecrest (ABC) was measured at a total of 14 buccal sites per mouse. Measurementswere made under a dissecting microscope (magnification, \ufffd50) fitted with avideo image marker measurement system (VHX-100; Keyence, Osaka, Japan)standardized to give measurements in micrometers. Bone measurements wereperformed a total of three times by two evaluators using a random and blindedprotocol.Distribution of 25k-hagA-MBP. The 25k-hagA-MBP protein and CT werelabeled with acridinium ester (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) in accor-dance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Mice were given acridinium ester-labeled 25k-hagA-MBP (10 \ufffdg and 20 \ufffdg) or acridinium ester-labeled CT (1 \ufffdgand 5 \ufffdg) via the nasal route. All nasal applications were given in a final volumeof 10 \ufffdl (5 \ufffdl per nostril) to na\u00efve mice. At 24 h after administration, mice weresacrificed, and the olfactory nerves and epithelium (ON/E), olfactory bulbs (OB),and brains were removed as described previously (54). Each tissue was homog-enized; the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min; and thesupernatants were tested for light activity by a luminometer (ARVO MX; Per-kin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).Statistics. Data are expressed as means \ufffd standard errors (SE) and werecompared using an unpaired Student t test.RESULTSNasal 25k-hagA-MBP elicits long-term antibody responsesin a TLR4-dependent manner. In an initial study, mice wereimmunized nasally with various amounts (10, 20, and 50 \ufffdg) of25k-hagA-MBP or 25k-hagA in order to determine optimalconcentrations for the induction of antibody responses. All ofthe dosages of 25k-hagA failed to induce 25k-specific serumIgG or IgA antibody responses that were above the dilutioncutoff (log2 of 5) used in our experiments. In contrast, 20 \ufffdg of25k-hagA-MBP induced high 25k-hagA-specific serum anti-body titers that were comparable to those induced by 50 \ufffdg ofthe fusion protein (data not shown). Therefore, 20 \ufffdg of 25k-hagA-MBP was used throughout this study. The time course ofanti-25k-hagA-specific serum antibody responses is shown inFig. 1A. Mice immunized nasally with 25k-hagA-MBP showedsignificant levels of serum IgG and IgA antibodies. Further-more, the serum IgG and IgA antibody responses induced by25k-hagA-MBP persisted for at least 1 year. As expected, ad-ministration of MBP alone or PBS did not induce 25k-hagA-specific antibody responses (data not shown). To provide adirect comparison of antibody responses to 25k-hagA-MBP,mice were given 25k-hagA plus CT as the adjuvant nasally.Interestingly, serum anti-25k-hagA IgG and IgA antibody ti-ters induced by 25k-hagA-MBP were comparable to those in-duced by 25k-hagA plus CT (Fig. 1B).

In addition, IgA anti-25k-hagA antibodies in saliva were maintained for 1 year, althoughthe responses decreased gradually from day 28 (Fig. 2B). Asexpected, nasal delivery of 25k-hagA, MBP alone, or PBSfailed to elicit 25k-hagA-specific antibody titers in the startingdilution (log2 of 1) used in these experiments. Analysis ofantibody-forming cells confirmed the results described aboveby revealing high numbers of IgA antibody-forming cells insalivary glands following nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP and by showing low numbers of antibody-forming cellsin the salivary glands of mice given 25k-hagA alone [(170 \ufffd16) \ufffd 106 cells for 25k-hagA-MBP versus (34 \ufffd 21) \ufffd 106cells for 25k-hagA].To test the possibility that MBP adjuvanticity is mediated viasignaling through TLR4, we examined antibody responses inTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice. To this end, TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice were immunizednasally with 25k-hagA-MBP or 25k-hagA by using an immuni-zation regimen identical to that described above. As expected,only low 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG antibody responses, andno detectable serum IgA antibody responses, were induced inTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice on day 21, while nasal administration toTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice resulted in the induction of high IgG and IgAantibody responses. Furthermore, nasal immunization ofTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice with 25k-hagA-MBP failed to elicit anti-25k-hagA IgA antibodies in the saliva (Fig. 3). Although we con-tinued to examine antibody levels until day 49, the responses inthe TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mouse group did not change (data not shown).As expected, nasal immunization of TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice with 25k-hagA failed to induce 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG, serumFIG. 2. 25k-hagA-specific IgA antibody response in saliva.

(A) Saliva samples were collected 7 days after the final immunization and were assessedfor 25k-hagA-specific IgA (left) and total-IgA (right) antibody responses. (B) The time course of 25k-hagA-specific IgA antibodies induced by nasal25k-hagA-MBP was also examined.

IMMUN.IgA, or salivary IgA antibody responses. Taken together, theseresults indicate that 25k-hagA-MBP is a potential nasal vaccinefor the induction of Ag-specific mucosal and systemic antibodyresponses and that signaling through TLR4 is involved in, andis necessary for, the mucosal adjuvanticity of MBP.25k-hagA-specific CD4\ufffd T cell responses. Since nasal im-munization with 25k-hagA-MBP elicited 25k-hagA-specific an-tibody responses in both mucosal and systemic compartments,it was important to establish the nature of the CD4\ufffd T cellhelp supporting the 25k-hagA-specific antibody responses.When CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleens or CLNs (which aredraining lymph nodes of the maxillofacial mucosal compart-ments) of immunized mice were restimulated with 25k-hagA invitro, significant levels of proliferative responses were induced(Fig. 4A).Analysis of the cytokine responses revealed that 25k-hagA-specific CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleen and CLNs producedhigh levels of IL-4 and IL-5 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, CD4\ufffd T cellsfrom immunized mice had an impaired ability to produceIFN-\ufffd (data not shown). These results clearly show that nasaladministration of 25k-hagA-MBP induces Th2-type cytokineresponses to support antigen-specific mucosal IgA, as well asserum IgG and IgA, antibody responses.Nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP expands CD11c\ufffdCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues. Wenext investigated the frequency of CD11c\ufffd DCs in variousmucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues. Our results showedlarge increases in the percentages of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs inthe spleens, CLNs, and NALT of mice given nasal 25k-hagA-MBP relative to those in mice given 25k-hagA. In contrast, theproportions of CD11c\ufffd CD11b\ufffd DCs and CD11c\ufffd B220\ufffdDCs were not altered (Fig. 5). Furthermore, these expandedDCs expressed greater numbers of costimulatory molecules(CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complexclass II [MHC II]) than DCs from mice given 25k-hagA (Table1). The activation of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs by 25k-hagA-MBPwas due to the adjuvanticity of MBP, because nasal adminis-tration of MBP induced this DC subset (Fig. 5 and Table 1).Since some activated T cells can also express CD11c, theproportions of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs were reevaluated withMHC class II. The results showed that the percentages ofMHC class IIhigh CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in CD11c\ufffd cells of the spleens,CLNs, and NALT of mice given nasal 25k-hagA-MBP or MBPalone were higher than those for mice given 25k-hagA (Table2). Taken together, these results indicate that nasal adminis-tration of 25k-hagA-MBP preferentially expands CD11c\ufffdCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs and also induces their activation in both mucosalinductive and systemic lymphoid tissues.Nasal 25k-hagA-MBP reduces alveolar bone loss caused byoral infection with P. gingivalis. Since nasal 25k-hagA-MBPelicited long-term antigen-specific antibody responses in seraand saliva, we sought to determine whether these antibodieswere protective. Thus, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP were in-fected orally with P. gingivalis. Mice immunized with 25k-hagA-MBP or 25k-hagA plus CT showed a significant reduc-tion in alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection 7 daysFIG. 3. 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG and IgA and salivary IgAantibody responses in TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice.

Fur-thermore, the antigen-specific antibody responses induced bynasal 25k-hagA-MBP provided significant protection and re-duced bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection, even at 1 yearafter immunization (Fig. 6B).In order to elucidate whether specific antibodies induced bynasal 25k-hagA-MBP were protective, we examined anti-25k-hagA as well as anti-P. gingivalis antibodies in serum and salivabefore and after P. gingivalis infection. The results indicatedthat the levels of serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgAantibodies to both 25k-hagA and P. gingivalis were identicalbefore and after infection (Fig. 6C and D). These results indi-cate that specific antibodies induced by nasal 25k-hagA-MBPprovide protection against P. gingivalis infection. Taken to-gether, these findings indicate that nasal immunization with25k-hagA-MBP provides long-term protection against oral in-fection by P. gingivalis.FIG. 5.

INFECT. IMMUN.Nasal 25k-hagA-MBP does not target neuronal tissues. Thedistribution of 25k-hagA-MBP in various tissues was analyzedafter nasal administration of acridinium ester-labeled 25k-hagA-MBP and was compared with that in groups inoculatedwith acridinium ester-labeled CT. Significantly lower levels of25k-hagA-MBP accumulation were observed in the ON/E, OB,and brain samples isolated from the group given 25k-hagA-MBP nasally than from the group given CT (Fig. 7). Theseresults indicate that nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBPdoes not target neuronal tissues.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that hagA has four large, con-tiguous direct repeats, and the repeat unit is thought to containthe hemagglutinin domain (17, 43). Furthermore, the DNAsequence of 25k-hagA is identical to that of the first repeat ofhagA (10). These findings have led to the consideration of25k-hagA as a candidate Ag for the development of humanvaccines. Our present study explored the potential of 25k-hagA-MBP as a nasal vaccine by using it as a model systemwith which to study the nature and kinetics of 25k-hagA-MBP-induced Ag-specific antibody responses and their protectiveability against oral infection by P. gingivalis. In the initial study,25k-hagA was administered nasally for the investigation ofAg-specific antibody responses. The results demonstrated thatTABLE 2.

These findings indicate that 25k-hagA is a weakimmunogen when given via the nasal route. Indeed, numerousstudies have demonstrated that nasal administration of pro-teins is only weakly immunogenic and requires appropriateAg delivery systems for the induction of sufficient immuneresponses in both mucosal and systemic compartments (21,31, 58).MBP has been widely used as a chaperone component invaccines and has been shown to enhance Ag-specific humoraland cellular immune responses (32, 46, 48, 51, 52). Thus, in thepresent study, we assessed the potential of a nasal vaccine,25k-hagA fused to MBP, to induce an immune response afterhost challenge. We have demonstrated that nasal administra-tion of 25k-hagA-MBP induces high levels of 25k-hagA-spe-cific serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA antibody re-sponses that are comparable to those induced by 25k-hagAplus an established mucosal adjuvant, CT. Furthermore, theseantibodies persist for at least 1 year. Induction of antibodyresponses is associated with elevated numbers of activatedCD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in both mucosal and systemic lymphoidtissues. Thus, increased proportions of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCswith upregulated expression of MHC II, CD40, CD80, andCD86 molecules in NALT, CLNs, and the spleen were noted inmice given 25k-hagA-MBP. Furthermore, 25k-hagA-MBP in-duced CD4\ufffd T cells producing predominantly Th2 cytokines(IL-4 and IL-5), as well as IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Impor-tantly, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP were significantly protectedagainst alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P.gingivalis, even 1 year after immunization. Interestingly, how-ever, our separate study has shown that when 25k-hagA mixedwith MBP was given nasally to mice, no detectable antibodytiters were induced (Y. Du et al., unpublished observations).Thus, unlike other adjuvants, MBP should be fused to thetarget antigen. These studies demonstrate that MBP is aneffective adjuvant for nasal immunization and that when usedas a fusion partner for 25k-hagA, it facilitates the developmentof a long-term protective antibody response.A previous study confirmed by Western immunoblotting thatoral immunization with recombinant avirulent Salmonella en-terica serovar Typhimurium expressing HagA induces HagA-specific serum antibody responses (30). In addition, a hen eggyolk antibody (IgY) against a truncated HagA protein has beendeveloped (53). However, none of these studies have quanti-tatively evaluated the immunogenicity as well as the protectiveefficacy of HagA vaccines. Thus, our results are the first toshow that a nasal vaccine combining MBP and 25k-hagA in-duces a long-term protective antibody response against oralinfection with P. gingivalis.It is well known that CD4\ufffd T cells and their derived Thcytokines are essential for the induction of Ag-specific anti-body responses. We found that CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleensand CLNs of mice immunized nasally with 25k-hagA-MBPsecreted IL-4 and IL-5 in response to stimulation with 25k-hagA. On the other hand, no detectable IFN-\ufffd production wasfound. IgG subclass responses confirmed the cytokine profile,showing that 25k-hagA-MBP elicited anti-25k-hagA IgG1 andIgG2b antibodies. These results suggest that the adjuvant ac-tivity of nasally administered MBP is mediated by IL-4-pro-ducing Th2-type CD4\ufffd T cells. However, a previous study hasshown that intraperitoneal immunization with a Rickettsia tsut-sugamushi antigen fused with MBP induces IFN-\ufffd-producingTh1-type responses (48). The basis for the different T helpercytokine patterns induced by MBP is not known. One possibleexplanation is the route of immunization. In this regard, it hasbeen shown that DCs freshly isolated from Peyer\u2019s patches, butnot from the spleen, induce the differentiation of Th2 cells(24). Furthermore, single-cell reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed high numbers of Th2 cytokine-specificmRNA molecules expressed by CD4\ufffd T cells in nasal passages,while CD4\ufffd T cells with a Th0 profile were present in NALT(20). Moreover, although CT is known to induce Th2 cells thatsecrete high levels of IL-4 when it is given via mucosal routes(59), parenteral administration of CT elicited both Th1- andTh2-type cytokine responses (55). Thus, immunization via mu-cosal routes, such as the nasal or oral route, may favor theinduction of Th2-type responses. However, in a previous study,nasal immunization with P. gingivalis fimbrial protein plus CTinduced both Th1- and Th2-type cytokine responses in CD4\ufffdT cells of the nasal passage and submandibular glands (60). Itmay be that the combination of nasal immunization and MBPis a particularly effective vaccine regimen for the induction ofTh2-type cytokine responses.Alternatively, the effects of MBP on CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCsmay particularly induce Th2-type responses. CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffdDCs are nonmigrating resident DCs derived from a precursor,distinct from monocytes, that continuously seed the lymphoidorgans from the bone marrow. This DC subset has in commonwith other DCs the ability to take up exogenous antigens andto process them for presentation on MHC class II molecules(50). It is known that DCs play a critical role in directing thedifferentiation of CD4\ufffd T cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells (3).In this regard, previous studies have demonstrated that nasaladministration of a DNA plasmid encoding the Flt3 ligand asan adjuvant stimulates CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs, which, in turn,lead to Th2 responses (13, 27). In support of this, our separateFIG. 7. Accumulation of 25k-hagA-MBP or CT in neuronal tissuesafter nasal challenge with acridinium ester-labeled 25k-hagA-MBP (10\ufffdg or 20 \ufffdg) or acridinium ester-labeled CT (1 \ufffdg or 5 \ufffdg).

INFECT. IMMUN.in vitro study has shown that MBP-treated DCs induced IL-4production in CD4\ufffd T cells (Du et al., unpublished). Thesefindings suggest that MBP as a mucosal adjuvant stimulatesCD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs, which enhance Th2 cytokine responses.However, as described above, intraperitoneal immunizationwith a Rickettsia tsutsugamushi antigen fused with MBP in-duces IFN-\ufffd-producing Th1-type responses (48). It may bethat the phenotype of DCs induced by nasal administration ofMBP is distinct from that of DCs induced by intraperitonealadministration of MBP. This would explain why nasal but notparenteral immunization induces Th2 responses. This interest-ing possibility is currently under investigation in our labora-tory.It should be noted that nasal immunization of TLR4-defi-cient mice with 25k-hagA-MBP induced only low levels of25k-hagA-specific serum IgG antibody responses. Neither se-rum IgA nor salivary IgA antibodies against 25k-hagA weredetected. In this regard, a previous study has shown that MBPinnately activates NF-\ufffdB-mediated cytokine signaling path-ways via TLR4 (11). To further support this, one of our sep-arate studies has demonstrated that CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCswere not activated in TLR4-deficient mice after nasal immu-nization with 25k-hagA-MBP (Du et al., unpublished). Thesefindings suggest that MBP as an adjuvant stimulates CD11c\ufffdCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in a TLR4-dependent manner for the inductionof 25k-hagA-specific Th2-type cytokine responses in both mu-cosal and systemic compartments with subsequent serum IgGand IgA and mucosal IgA antibody responses.Nasal administration of vaccines has been widely used formucosal immunization because it delivers the antigen directlyto nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues without the influ-ence of enzymes and acids in the gastrointestinal tract. How-ever, previous studies have shown that nasally administered CTor adenovirus vectors accumulate in the ON/E regions via theGM1 ganglioside (34, 54). Furthermore, CT as an adjuvantredirects coadministered protein Ag into these neuronal tis-sues (54). A clinical study suggested a strong association be-tween nasal influenza vaccine and Bell\u2019s palsy (40). Thesefindings raise concerns about a potential role of GM1-bindingmolecules that target neural tissues, including the central ner-vous system, in nasal immunization. However, another studyhas provided evidence that deposition of CT via the olfactorytissues does not lead to obvious pathological changes in braintissues after nasal administration (16). Although the exact bi-ological and pathological significance of vaccine deposition inthe central nervous system is uncertain, we also investigatedthe distribution of 25k-hagA-MBP in ON/E and OB after nasalimmunization. Interestingly, 25k-hagA-MBP accumulations inthe ON/E, OB, and brain were significantly lower than those ofCT. The biological effects of residual 25k-hagA-MBP on theneural tissues needs to be elucidated in the next study. Takentogether, these results suggest that nasal administration ofMBP as a chaperone component in vaccines is safer than thatof GM1-binding molecules in terms of the potential threatposed by vaccines trafficking in neural tissues, including thecentral nervous system.In summary, the fusion protein containing 25k-hagA andMBP provides a very effective means of eliciting IL-4- andIL-5-producing Th2-type CD4\ufffd T cells for the induction ofserum IgG, serum IgA, and mucosal IgA antibody responses.The mechanisms responsible for the effects of MBP are medi-ated by increased levels of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in a TLR4-dependent manner. Finally, 25k-hagA-specific immune re-sponses induced by 25k-hagA-MBP provide protectiveimmunity against alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalisinfection. These findings suggest that nasal administration of25k-hagA-MBP effectively elicits protective levels of antibod-ies against 25k-hagA and may be an effective and safe nasalvaccine for the immunization of humans against P. gingivalisinfection.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Mitsuo Hayakawa for help with the antigen preparation.This work was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research(22592102, 22390398, and 22791816) from the Japan Society for thePromotion of Science and by an \u201cAcademic Frontier\u201d Project forPrivate Universities matching fund subsidy from the Ministry of Edu-cation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, 2007\u20132011.REFERENCES1.
