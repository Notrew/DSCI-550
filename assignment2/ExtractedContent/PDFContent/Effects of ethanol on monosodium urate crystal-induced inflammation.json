In an in vivo exper-iment, MSU crystals were administered into subcutaneous air pouches created in mice, following peritoneal injection of ethanol dilutedwith PBS. MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) stimulated the secretion of TNF-a, IL-8, and IL-1b from THP1 cells, while ethanol at a concen-tration of 0.8% reduced those increases by 1.79-, 1.63-, and 1.75-fold, respectively. In vitro, MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) significantlyincreased the expression of phosphorylated JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 proteins in THP1 cells, while ethanol at a concentration of 0.8%reduced those increased expressions by 1.28-, 1.14-, and 1.68-fold, respectively. In addition, MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) significantlyincreased the expression of phosphorylated NF-jB protein in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions and decreased the expression of IjBain the cytosolic fraction. Ethanol at a concentration of 0.8% reduced the MSU-increased expression of phosphorylated NF-jB in thenuclear and cytosolic fractions by 1.25- and 1.27-fold, respectively, while it also reduced the MSU-decreased expression of IjBa inthe cytosolic fraction by 1.12-fold. In vivo, MSU crystals increased the number of leukocytes, as well as the concentrations of KC,MIP1a, and IL-6 in pouch fluids, while ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) considerably inhibited the MSU crystal-induced inflammation.These results strongly suggest that ethanol suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by MSU crystals via a pathwayincluding MAPK (p38, JNK, and ERK1/2, especially p38) and NF-jB.\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionHyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greaterthan 420 lmol/L and indicates that total body urate isincreased. When hyperuricemia exists, plasma and extracel-lular fluids are supersaturated with respect to urate, leadingto crystal formation and deposition. Therefore, gout devel-ops on the background of hyperuricemia. Gout is a diseasethat is manifested by recurrent attacks of acute arthritis,tophaceous deposits of monosodium urate monohydrate(MSU) in and around the joints of the extremities, renalRE1043-4666/$ - see front matter \ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yamamoto).disease involving the interstitial tissues and blood vessels,and uric acid nephrolithiasis. During attacks of acutearthritis, MSU crystals are found in leukocytes in synovialfluids, indicating that they are involved with induction ofthose attacks. In previous studies [1,2], MSU crystals weredemonstrated to stimulate synovial cells, monocytes\u2013mac-rophages, and neutrophils to produce a variety of differentcytokines including TNF-a, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-6, and mono-cyte chemotactic factor, which induce acute inflammation.It is well known that ingestion of a large amount of alco-holic beverages containing ethanol causes hyperuricemiaand gouty arthritis. Ethanol enhances adenine nucleotidedegradation that leads to an increased production of uricacid [3\u20135], while it also increases the blood concentrationof lactic acid, which inhibits the urinary excretion of uricmailto:tetsuya@hyo-med.ac.jpT. Inokuchi et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 198\u2013204 199acid [6]. These actions of ethanol raise the plasma concen-tration of urate, leading to gouty attack. Accordingly,patients with gout are recommended to refrain from inges-tion of large amounts of alcoholic beverages.Our experience has shown that patients with gout rarelyexperience gouty arthritis at the time of drinking, whereasthey frequently experience a gouty attack due to hyperuri-cemia-induced crystal formation and deposition in thejoints early the next morning during sleep after ingestinga large amount of alcoholic beverages the previous evening.Several reasons can be considered for why patients withgout rarely experience gouty arthritis when consumingalcohol. First, the associated increase in plasma concentra-tion of urate is not enough to cause gouty arthritis. Second,ingested ethanol affects the sensory area of the central ner-vous system, leading to a decrease in the sense of pain.Third, ethanol may suppress inflammation due to uratecrystal deposition via cytokine regulation. In the presentstudy, we focused on the third reason, because a previousstudy demonstrated that excessive ethanol consumptiondepresses the immune system, thus increasing the suscepti-bility to infection [7], and other studies have reported thatethanol suppressed the immune responses of severalimmune cell types, including monocytes, macrophage,T lymphocytes, and neutrophils [8\u201312]. Recently, it wasdemonstrated that ethanol inhibits LPS-induced accumula-tion of leukocytes [13], which suggests that it may also inhi-bit arthritis induced by MSU crystals. Therefore, weexamined the effects of ethanol on MSU crystal-inducedinflammation in vitro as well as in vivo in order to elucidatethe mechanisms involved.2. Materials and methods2.1. ReagentsUric acid was purchased from Wako Pure ChemicalsLtd. (Osaka, Japan) and MSU crystals were produced bya method previously described [14]. In brief, after treatinguric acid for 2 h at 200 \ufffdC, a uric acid solution (0.03 M,pH 7.5) was prepared by dissolution of equimolar quanti-ties of uric acid and sodium hydroxide. Sodium chloride(0.1 M final concentration) was added to accelerate the for-mation of triclinic MSU crystallization. Endotoxin was notdetected in 10 mg MSU crystals/ml in PBS (<0.8 endotoxinpg/ml by a limulus amoebocyte assay.2.2. Cell culture conditionsTHP1 cells from a human monocyte cell line, weregrown in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin\u2013streptomycinand 20% fetal cow serum (FBS) at 37 \ufffdC under 5% CO2/95% air. Prior to the experiments, cells (0.5 \ufffd 106 cells)were plated in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (Iwaki Glass,Tokyo, Japan) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing penicil-lin\u2013streptomycin and 20% fetal cow serum, then pretreatedfor differentiation with 10 nM phorbol 12-myrisate 13-ace-RETRAtate (PMA) for 24 h. Thereafter, the culture medium wasaspirated and 0.5 ml of fresh medium containing penicil-lin\u2013streptomycin and 1% fetal cow serum was added, withor without MSU crystals (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg/ml) in thepresence or absence of ethanol (0%, 0.4%, or 0.8% concen-tration). Differentiated cells cultured with medium contain-ing 20% fetal cow serum secreted considerable amounts ofcytokines, while the increase in MSU crystals-induced cyto-kine secretion was slight, as compared with the baselinevalues. On the other hand, those cells cultured with 1%fetal cow serum secreted negligible amounts of cytokines,whereas the increase in MSU crystal-induced cytokinesecretion was significant. Therefore, 1% fetal cow serumwas used instead of 20% fetal cow serum in the presentstudy. Twelve hours after the addition of fresh culture med-ium, the medium was aspirated to measure the secretion ofcytokines. In addition, to investigate the expression ofphosphorylated p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 proteins, 1 h afterthe addition of fresh medium, the medium was removedand THP1 cells were washed with PBS. The cells were thendissolved with RIPA buffer consisting of PBS, 1% NonidetP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing100 lg of PMSF/ml RIPA, 30 ll of aprotinin (Sigma, St.Louis, MO, USA)/ml RIPA, and 1 lmol sodium orthovan-adate/ml of RIPA, after which the expression of the pro-teins was determined.2.3. CytokinesHuman and mouse IL-8 levels were measured usingHuman IL-8 ELISA kit (BMI Medical & Biological Labo-ratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). Human IL-1b, TNF-a,and IL-6 levels and those levels of mouse IL-1b, IL-6, KC,and MIP1a were determined with commercially availableELISA kits (human: BioSource International, Inc., CA,USA, mouse: R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN, USA).2.4. Immunoblotting of phosphorylated p38, JNK, and ERKproteinsRIPA containing 5 lg of protein from the dissolved cellswas applied to gels and electrophoresis was performed,after which immunoblotting was performed as describedpreviously [15]. In brief, phosphorylated p38, JNK, andERK1/2 proteins together with GAPDH protein as a con-trol were each transferred electrophoretically from a 10%SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel to a PVDF membrane at 1 mA/cm2 for 90 min, using Trans Blot SD (Bio-Rad Laborato-ries, Hercules, CA, USA). After incubation with BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals, Osaka) overnight at4 \ufffdC, the PVDF membrane was washed with 50 mMTris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (TBS) and incubated over-night at room temperature in a dilution of anti-phospho-SPARK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (Cell Signaling TechnologyInc., MA, USA), phospho-p44/42 map kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (pT180/pY182)CTEDTable 1Effects of ethanol on MSU-increased secretion of TNF-a (pg/ml) fromTHP1 cells0% Ethanol 0.4% Ethanol 0.8% Ethanol0.75 mg/ml MSU 1732 \u00b1 78 1148 \u00b1 68** 965 \u00b1 51**0.5 mg/ml MSU 1213 \u00b1 78 787 \u00b1 58** 577 \u00b1 32**0.25 mg/ml MSU 633 \u00b1 47 520 \u00b1 82** 306 \u00b1 37**0 mg/ml MSU ND ND NDValues are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD (number of samples = 5).

The PVDF membrane was then washedthree times for 10 min each, with TBS and incubated witha 1:500 dilution of a secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG; or anti-goat antibody) for 3 hat room temperature. Next, the PVDF membrane waswashed 4 times with TBS and incubated with avidin\u2013biotincomplex (Vectastain ABC Elite kit; Vector Laboratories,CA, USA). Finally, the phosphorylated p38, JNK, andERK1/2 proteins along with the GAPDH protein werevisualized by incubation with 0.01% H2O2 in TBS contain-ing 0.05% diaminobenzidine.2.5. Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts andimmunoblotting of phosphorylated NF-jB andnonphosphorylated IjBaDifferentiated THP1 cells were incubated with freshmedium containing penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 1% fetalcow serum, with or without MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml)in the presence or absence of 0.8% ethanol at 37 \ufffdC for1 h, then nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were preparedusing an NE-PER kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). There-after, using 5 lg protein of each extract, western blot anal-yses of phosphorylated NF-jB and nonphosphorylatedIjBa expressions were performed as described above, usingphospho-NF-jB p65 (Ser 536) antibody (Cell SignalingTechnology Inc.) and IjBa/MAD-3 (BD TransductionLaboratories, CA, USA). As controls for nuclear and cyto-plasmic proteins, p44/p42 and b-actin, respectively, wereused.2.6. MiceSpecific pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice (6\u20138 weekold) were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).2.7. Treatment of miceIt is considered better to inject MSU crystals into mousejoints to investigate MSU crystal-induced arthritis. How-ever, it is very difficult to inject MSU crystals into mousejoints and aspirate joint fluids after such an injection.Therefore, we performed the present in vivo experimentusing a subcutaneous air pouch, which is similar to a jointin terms of MSU crystal-induced inflammation [16,17].Subcutaneous air pouches were created in the backs ofthe mice according to a method previously described [16].Three milliliters of air was injected into the subcutaneoustissue, followed by a second injection of 5 ml of air after3 days. Seven days after the first injection, a preparationof MSU crystals (3 mg in a volume of sterile PBS) wasinjected into the air pouches 15 min after intraperitonealinjection of sterile PBS containing ethanol (5 ml/kg bodyweight) or sterile PBS alone. As a control, the same volumeRETRof sterile PBS was injected into the air pouches 15 min afterintraperitoneal injection of sterile PBS. Eight hours later,the pouch fluid was harvested by injecting 3 ml of PBS.The infiltrating cells were then counted using a hemocy-tometer and stained with Wright\u2013Giemsa solution to per-form a differential count of leukocytes. In addition, thepouch fluid sample was centrifuged at 1500g for 10 minand the supernatant was obtained.2.8. Statistical analysisValues are expressed as the median (range) ormean \u00b1 SD, and significant differences between the vari-ables were analyzed using a nonparametric method orANOVA. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.3. Results3.1. In vitro dataMSU crystals stimulated the secretion of TNF-a fromTHP1 cells, which were enhanced by increases in MSUcrystal concentration in medium in a range of 0.25\u20130.75 mg/ml (Table 1).

Our results showed that KC, MIP1a, IL-1b, and IL-6 were increased, together with increases in the numbers ofleukocytes and neutrophils (Table 4). On the other hand,ethanol considerably reduced the MSU crystal-inducedinflammation by reducing the secretion of KC, MIP1a,IL-1b, and IL-6, as well as numbers of leukocytes and neu-trophils by 2.92-fold (P < 0.01), 4.85-fold (P < 0.01), 17.9-fold (P < 0.05), 18.6-fold (P < 0.05), 4.29-fold (P < 0.05),and 5.5-fold (P < 0.05), respectively (Table 4).4. DiscussionA number of studies have reported that ethanol inhib-ited LPS-induced increases in inflammatory-cytokine pro-duction in macrophage\u2013monocyte lineage cells [18\u201321],which was shown to occur via decreases in mitogen-acti-vated protein kinase (MAPK) [8,18\u201323]. In addition, itwas reported that ethanol has an effect on TLR4, probablyby changing the cell membrane, and inhibits LPS-inducedp38 phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in LPS-induced secretion of IL-8 and TNF-a [23]. These findingssuggest that ethanol reduces LPS-induced inflammation.Recently, it was reported that MSU crystals activatedcaspase-1 [16,24] and also processed the inactive form ofIL-1b to the active form via the NACHT-LRR-PYD-con-taining protein-3 inflammasome [24]. In addition, it wasdemonstrated that MSU crystals stimulated the secretionof cytokines containing IL-1b and TNF-a from monocytesvia TLR2 and TLR4 [25], while another study found thatMSU stimulated the secretion of IL-1b from resident cellsand the secreted IL-1b stimulated an MyD88-dependentamplification of proinflammatory responses via the IL-1breceptor (IL-1 R) on non-bone marrow-derived cells, sug-gesting that the secretion of IL-1b from resident cellsRETRinduced by MSU crystals plays an important role in goutyattack [26]. These findings indicate that IL-1b produced byMSU crystal-induced activation of capase-1 may causeproinflammatory response via a MyD88-dependent signalpathway including MAPK and NF-jB. They also suggestthat ethanol inhibits MSU-induced inflammation. Accord-ingly, we conducted the present study to determine whetherethanol inhibits the MSU crystal-induced secretion ofinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo.In the present in vitro study, MSU crystals stimulatedthe secretion of IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b from THP1 cells,while ethanol inhibited the MSU-induced secretion of thesecytokines (Tables 1\u20133). A previous study demonstratedthat MSU crystals-induced the activation of JNK,ERK1/2, and p38 in THP1 cells, and also increased theirsecretion of IL-8 [27]. Further, a recent more study showedthat MSU crystals promoted MSK1/2, ERK1/2, and IjBaphosphorylation as well as NF-jB and AP-1 translocationin the murine macrophage cell line B10R [28]. Our findingsalso indicate that MSU crystals stimulate IL-8 secretionfrom THP1 cells together with increased phosphorylationof ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, theyincreased the levels of phosphorylated NF-jB in the cyto-solic and nuclear fractions and decreased IjBa in the cyto-solic fraction (Figs. 3 and 4).

Bars labeled (1), (2), and (3)are the same as in Fig. 3.T. Inokuchi et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 198\u2013204 203showed that MSU crystals produce proinflammatory cyto-kines via a pathway including MAPK and NF-jB in THP1cells, as described above [27,28]. Further, in the presentexperiments, ethanol slightly inhibited the MSU crystal-induced increases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK,while it considerably inhibited the increase in phosphory-lated p38. In addition, ethanol inhibited the MSU crys-tal-induced increase in phosphorylated NF-jB in thecytosolic and nuclear fractions as well as MSU crystal-induced decrease in IjBa in the cytosolic fraction. Ethanolalso inhibited the secretion of IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b inTHP1 cells induced by MSU crystals. Thus, we concludedthat ethanol decreases the MSU-induced secretion of IL-8,TNF-a, and IL-1b via pathways, including MAPK (p38,JNK, and ERK1/2, especially p38) and NF-jB.Arbabi et al. reported that ethanol inhibited LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation in human mononuclear cells[8], whereas Oak et al. showed that ethanol did not have aneffect on LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation [29]. Thosecontrasting results may be related to the timing differencesbetween the administration of ethanol and TLR ligand uti-lized in their experiments, and/or differences in ethanolconcentration in the media. In the former study, ethanolranging from 46 to 174 mM was added to culture mediathat included monocytes at 1 h before the addition ofLPS, while in the latter, ethanol at 25 mM and LPS wereRETRAadministered at the same time. In the present study, weadded ethanol at 46\u2013174 mM to culture media thatincluded THP1 cells at 1 h before the addition of MSUcrystals, since patients with gout typically have a goutyattack following the ingestion of alcoholic beverages. Ourresults are similar to those of Arbabi et al. [8], though weused THP1 cells instead of monocytes.Oak et al. also demonstrated that ethanol enhancedincreases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK proteins,whereas it did not have an effect on phosphorylated p38protein in monocytes in the presence of TLR2 and TLR4ligands (PGN and LPS) [29]. Further, they demonstratedthat ethanol inhibited the increase in phosphorylatedERK1/2 proteins, but did not have an effect on phosphor-ylated JNK protein in monocytes in the presence of aTLR4 ligand (LPS) alone [29]. In contrast, in the presentstudy, ethanol slightly inhibited MSU crystal-inducedincreases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK proteins,while it considerably inhibited the increase in phosphory-lated p38 protein in THP1 cells. The differences betweenthese results may be ascribable to the different ligands used.In our in vivo experiment, MSU crystals caused neutro-phil accumulation and the secretion of KC, IL-6, IL-1b,and MIP1a when injected into subcutaneous air pouchesin mice. However, TNF-a secretion from THP1 cellsinduced by administration of the MSU crystals was notdetected in the pouches 8 h after injection. In a previousrabbit study, the secretion of TNF-a in joints increasedand peaked at 2 h after intra-articular administration ofMSU crystals, and then rapidly decreased until only smallamounts of TNF-a were detected after 4 h [30]. Together,these results suggest that TNF-a is abruptly secreted imme-diately after the administration of MSU crystals for a per-iod of a few hours. However, since intra-articularadministration of MSU crystals together with the anti-TNF-a antibody reduced the number of inflammatory cellsin the rabbit joints, as compared with administration ofMSU crystals alone, it was suggested that TNF-a plays arole in MSU crystal-induced arthritis. In addition, intra-articular administration of MSU crystals together withthe anti-IL-8 antibody or IL-1b receptor antagonist alsoreduced the number of inflammatory cells, as comparedwith administration of MSU crystals alone. Those resultsalso suggest that IL-8 and IL-1b play roles in MSU crys-tal-induced arthritis. Therefore, even though TNF-a wasnot detected in our in vivo experiment, it may enhanceMSU crystal-induced inflammation together with othercytokines (KC, IL-6, IL-1b, and MIP1a).A recent study of IL-1b receptor-defective type micefound that inflammatory reactions, including neutrophilaccumulation, due to MSU were markedly decreased, ascompared with wild type mice, indicating that IL-1b is animportant factor in gouty arthritis and that MyD88-depen-dent IL-1b receptor signaling is essential for that condition[26]. Since KC and MIP1a are also neutrophil chemoat-tractants, in addition to IL-1b, the present results suggestthat ethanol inhibited the MSU crystal-induced secretionCTED204 T.

They also show that thoughthe effect is short-lived, the anti-inflammatory action ofethanol may retard the onset of ethanol-induced goutyarthritis despite an ethanol-induced increase in the serumconcentration of urate.Nevertheless, additional examinations are needed to elu-cidate the acute effects of ethanol on gouty inflammation.AReferences[1] Guerne PA, Terkeltaub R, Zuraw B, Lotz M.
