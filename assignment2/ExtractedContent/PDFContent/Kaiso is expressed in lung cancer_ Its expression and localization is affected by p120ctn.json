However, clinical studies of human solid tumors have notbeen reported to investigate relationship between these proteins.Methods: Expression and localization of Kaiso and p120ctn were examined in 196 lung cancer spec-imens (including 55 cases of paired lymph node metastases and 80 cases with complete follow-uprecords) by immunohistochemistry. Three lung cancer cell lines, BE1, SPC, and A549 were used to estab-lish p120ctn stably ablated or overexpressed cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirmp120ctn bind Kaiso in lung cancer tissue and cell lines. Localization and expression levels of Kaiso weredetected via immunofluorescence, cytoplasmic vs. nuclear fractionation Western blot analysis and reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction.Results: Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was evident in 115 (58.7%), and abnormal p120ctn expression wasnoted in 168 (85.7%). Cytoplasmic Kaiso and abnormal p120ctn expressions were associated with higherdegree of malignancy (high-stage and lymph node metastases, all P < 0.05). Abnormal p120ctn and cyto-plasmic Kaiso expressions were higher in matched autologous nodal metastases than in primary growths.The lung cancer-related 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients who were cytoplasmicKaiso-positive (22.9%; P = 0.029) or abnormal p120ctn expression (20.6%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysisshowed abnormal p120ctn expression was an independent factor defining the clinicopathological char-acters of patients. Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was correlated with cytoplasmic p120ctn, they formedACTEDKaiso\u2013p120ctn complex in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. In addition, p120ctn ablation and overex-pression altered Kaiso subcellular localization and protein level. Although both isoforms can regulatesubcellular localization and protein levels of Kaiso, we found that only p120ctn isoform 3, but not isoform1, directly interacts with Kaiso.Conclusion: p120ctn and Kaiso might co-participate in the progression and lymph node metastasis of lungexprRcancer. p120ctn regulates. IntroductionIt is known that primary lung cancer is one of the most malig-ant solid tumors, and that its range of abilities in invasion andetastasis is very wide. Dysfunction of adhesion molecules andETmpairment of cell adhesion may be the initial steps of such tumorrogression [1\u20133]. Of these molecules, p120-catenin (p120ctn) maylay an important role in tumor progression and metastasis dueo its core function in cadherin turnover and cell migration [4\u20139].\u2217 Corresponding author at: Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medicalciences and First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, North 2nd Road 92,eping Ward, Shenyang 110001, China.

All rights reserved.In most human tumors, p120ctn levels are reduced or even elimi-nated [5]. We have reported previously that abnormal expressionof p120ctn (reduction of p120ctn isoforms 1 and 3) is associatedwith lymph node metastasis in lung cancer cells [10\u201312].p120ctn is an Armadillo protein first identified as a prominenttyrosine kinase substrate implicated in cell transformation by Src[13], and in ligand-induced receptor signaling through various tyro-sine kinase receptors [14,15]. p120ctn binds to the juxtamembranedomain (JMD) of E-cadherin [6,16], where it modulates cell\u2013celladhesion by regulating cadherin turnover and stability at the cellsurface [7\u20139]. Additionally, p120ctn modulates the activities of theRhoA, Rac and Cdc42 GTPases, which are the key mediators ofcytoskeletal organization [17\u201319]. Furthermore, recent evidencehas revealed that nuclear p120ctn acts to relieve transcriptionalrepression mediated by Kaiso, a member of the broad complex,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002http://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcanmailto:wangeh@hotmail.comdx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2009.06.0132 Cancet[Bfivddsbt[dmnacacm[pisdpttlsieppttpwcfmttKpa22aiC1aopfOAp2.2.3. p120ctn cDNA plasmids and transfectionFollowing Dr. Reynolds\u2019 method [7], mouse p120ctn isoformA06 S.-D. Dai et al. / Lungramtrak, bric a\u2019 brac/pox virus and zinc finger family (BTB/POZ)20].Kaiso contains an amino-terminal, protein\u2013protein interactionTB/POZ domain and a carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding C2H2 zincnger domain [20]. Interaction between p120ctn and Kaiso occursia the Arm repeats 1\u20137 of p120ctn and a noncontiguous Kaisoomain flanking the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingeromain. This close physical juxtaposition of the p120ctn-bindingite of Kaiso with its DNA-binding motif may explain why DNAinding of Kaiso is inhibited by nuclear p120ctn [21,22]. It is shownhat nuclear p120ctn can modulate non-canonical Wnt signaling23], and, along with T cell factor (TCF)/\ufffd-catenin complexes, coor-inately regulate canonical Wnt gene targets such as cyclin D1 andmp-7 by Kaiso [24,25]. There is mounting evidence that Kaiso is auclear protein that plays a role in transcription repression [23\u201326]nd Kaiso is frequently detected in the nuclei of various mammalianell lines. However, immunohistochemical study of human normalnd tumor tissues show that Kaiso is predominantly localized in theytoplasm rather than in cell nuclei. Interestingly, Kaiso\u2019s cytoplas-ic localization almost always coincided with cytoplasmic p120ctn27]. Thus, it remains a question that whether Kaiso interacts with120ctn in cytoplasm.The human p120ctn gene comprises 21 exons, potentially encod-ng up to 32 protein isoforms as the result of alternative productplicing. All p120ctn isoforms share the central Armadillo repeatomain but have a divergent N- and C-terminal end [6]. Human120ctn isoforms, designated from 1 to 4, differ from each other byhe start codon used. In our previous study, we determined that onlywo isoforms (isoforms 1 and 3) expressed in normal and cancerousung tissues [10] and the roles of these two isoforms on invasion areomewhat different [28]. Because p120ctn is expressed as multiplesoforms with different capacities to bind to the cytoskeleton or tonter the nucleus [29\u201332], these isoforms might have a differentotential to modulate the function of Kaiso in vivo. We also try torovide some experimental data to clarify this issue in this study.To data, little clinicopathological report has referred to the rela-ionship between Kaiso and p120ctn expression in human solidumors. In this study, we examined the expression patterns andrognostic significance of p120ctn and Kaiso expression in patientsith lung cancer. Meanwhile, Kaiso and p120ctn expressions in 55ases of lymph node metastases were probed to investigate dif-erences between primary lung cancers and paired lymph nodeetastases. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to confirmhe binding between p120ctn and Kaiso in lung cancer tissues andhree lung cancer cell lines. To investigate the effect of p120ctn onaiso, we depleted total p120ctn expression and overexpressed two120ctn isoforms in lung cancer cell lines to evaluate the expressionnd subcellular localization of Kaiso.. Materials and methods.1. Tissue samplesLung cancer tissues from 196 patients with primary lung cancernd normal from 20 of these patients were obtained follow-ng surgical resection at the First Clinical College affiliated withhina Medical University between 2001 and 2005. Among the96 cases, the lymph node metastases of 55 patients were avail-ble. All patients had not received radiotherapy, chemotherapyr immunotherapy before the operation. The average age of theRETRatients was 57.24 years (from 20 to 81 years). The ratio of male toemale was 1.87:1. Based on the classification of the World Healthrganization [33] and the TNM stage revised by International Uniongainst Cancer (UICC) in 2002 [34], we classified the patients withrimary lung cancer into the following groups: (1) 81 squamousr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215cell carcinomas, with 27 cases at stage I, 23 cases at stage II, 35cases at stage III, and 2 cases at stage IV; 14 cases were highly dif-ferentiated, 33 cases were moderately differentiated, and 40 caseswere undifferentiated; and 49 cases with lymph node metasta-sis. (2) 115 adenocarcinomas, with 33 cases at stage I, 23 casesat stage II, 48 cases at stage III, and 5 cases at stage IV; 31 caseswere highly differentiated, 27 cases were moderately differenti-ated, and 51 cases were undifferentiated; and 75 cases with lymphnode metastasis. A total of 55 samples (24 squamous cell carcino-mas, 31 adenocarcinomas) with autologous nodal metastasis wereused as paired samples to perform immunohistochemical analysis.20 cases of tumor samples (including primary cancer and lymphnode metastases cancer tissues) were quickly frozen in deep freezerefrigerator until protein extraction. Lymph node status was deter-mined by routine pathological examination of dissected pulmonaryhilar and mediastinal and intrapulmonary lymph nodes. In addi-tion, immunohistochemistry was completed on 80 cases of primaryNSCLC paraffin specimens, which had complete follow-up records.This study was conducted under the regulations of the InstitutionalReview Board of China Medical University. Informed consent wasobtained prior to surgery from all enrolled patients.2.2. Cell culture, plasmid construction and transfection2.2.1. Cell cultureThe human pulmonary giant cell cancer cell line BE1, whichexpresses high levels of p120ctn, kindly was provided by Dr JieZheng of Department of Pathology, Peking University Health Sci-ence Center (Beijing, China). Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lineA549 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection(Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), containing 10% fetal calf serum(Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), and100 IU/ml streptomycin (Sigma).2.2.2. p120ctn siRNA plasmids and transfectionFor the production of the p120ctn-siRNA (GeneBank#: 001331)plasmids used in the experiments, sense and anti-sense oligonu-cleotides were annealed and inserted between BamHI and HindIIIsites of the pGCsi vector by Shanghai GeneChem (ShanghaiGeneChem Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The sequences of the threedouble-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows:A: 5\u2032-GGATCACAGTCACCTTCTA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TAGAAGGTGACTGTGATCC-3\u2032B: 5\u2032-GCACTTGTATTACAGACAA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TTGTCTGTAATACAAGTGC-3\u2032C: 5\u2032-GGATAACAAGATTGCCATA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TATGGCAATCTTGTTATCC-3\u2032The BE1 was stably transfected with the p120ctn-siRNAplasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following themanufacturer\u2019s instructions. A non-specific scrambled p120ctn-siRNA plasmid (5\u2032-GG TAG AGA GAC AGT CTC GC-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GC GAGACT GTC TCT CTA CC-3\u2032) was used as a negative control. Selec-tion was accomplished with G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentrationof 0.3 mg/ml. Drug-resistant cells were tested for the absence ofp120ctn expression by Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR.CTED1A and p120ctn isoform 3A cDNA (a gift from Dr. Reynolds, Van-derbilt University, Nashville, USA) were stably transfected usingLipofectamine 2000 into human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.The stably transfected cells were named A549-1A and A549-3A,respectively. The empty plasmid was used as a negative control.Cance2aIinw2aFTaadFidCtat4ccAwof\u201ctwomFt3tTasna2vwmmooCmL4roj(SS.-D. Dai et al. / Lung.3.

Immunohistochemical staining and evaluationImmunochemistry was performed using the ultrasensitivevidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase complex method (Maixin Biotechnology,uzhou, Fujian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.he antibodies used were mouse anti-human Kaiso monoclonalntibody (clone 6F, dilution 1:400, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA)nd mouse anti-human p120ctn monoclonal antibody (clone 15D2,ilution 1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories. Lexington KY, USA).or the negative control, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was usedn place of the primary antibodies.The percentage of immunoreactive tumor cells was indepen-ently assessed by two observers (S.D.D and Q.W.) on all sections.ases with discrepancies were jointly re-evaluated by the inves-igators, and a consensus was obtained. Positive samples werenalyzed semi-quantitative in at low magnification (\u00d7100) to iden-ify areas where Kaiso/p120ctn was evenly stained. We counted00 tumor cells and calculated the percentage of positively stainingells. Staining scores were determined by the percentage of positiveells per slide for membranous and cytoplasmic staining separately.s proposed previously [12,35,36], normal expression was definedhen over 90% of the tumor cells showed cell membrane stainingf p120ctn. When less than 90% of the tumor cells were stainedor p120ctn at the cell membrane, the sample was labeled withreduced membranous expression\u201d. When more than 10% of theumor cells stained for cytoplasmic p120ctn expression, the sampleas labeled with \u201cectopic cytoplasmic expression\u201d. A designationf either \u201creduced membranous expression\u201d or \u201cectopic cytoplas-ic expression\u201d was defined as abnormal expression of p120ctn.or evaluation of the staining of Kaiso in tissue sections, we usehe criteria as follows: 0: less than 25%; 1: 26\u201350%; 2: 51\u201375%; and: more than 75%. The staining intensity was categorized by rela-ive intensity as follows: 1 (weak); 2 (intermediate) and 3 (strong).he proportion and intensity scores were then multiplied to obtaintotal score. Score less than 1 was considered as negative, whilecores of 2 or more were considered as positive. Cases were scoreduclear positive when \u22655% of the cells reacted with the anti-Kaisontibody..5. Immunofluorescent stainingImmunofluorescent staining was performed as described pre-iously [10,36]. Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixedith ice-cold 100% methanol for 15 min at \u221220 \u25e6C, followed by per-eabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Kaiso was detected using twoouse monoclonal antibodies (6F and 12H, each at a concentrationf 4 \ufffdg/ml. Upstate, Lake Placid, NY and Santa Cruz Biotechnol-gy, Inc. respectively), and a polyclonal antibody (C-18, Santaruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and p120ctn was detected using mouseonoclonal antibodies (clone 15D2, BD Transduction Laboratories,exington KY, USA). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at\u25e6C followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated toRETRAhodamine/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled at a dilutionf 1:100 (Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co. Bei-ing, China). The nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodidePI, 50 \ufffdg/ml, Sigma)/4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:200,igma). The cells were examined with an Olympus IX51 fluorescentr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215 207microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and images were recordedwith a CoolPIX 5400 camera (Nikon, Japan).2.6. RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).cDNA was prepared using the RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Version3.0 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, Liaoning, China), according tothe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR was carried out with thefollowing primers: Kaiso, 5\u2032-TGCCTATTATAACAGAGTCTTT-3\u2032 and5\u2032-AGTAGG TGTGATATTTGTTAAAG-3\u2032. p120ctn, 5\u2032-TGCCCTGCTG-GATTTGTCTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTCCCATCATCTG-3\u2032. \ufffd-actin, 5\u2032-AGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGA-3\u2032. After electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, the PCR productbands were visualized using BioImaging Systems with LabworksImage Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA,USA). The relative mRNA levels were normalized to the relativeamount of \ufffd-actin mRNA.2.7. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysisCells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS followed by incuba-tion on ice with lysis buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris,150 Mm NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leu-peptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mMEDTA for 5 min. Cells were harvested from the plates, and trans-ferred to a 1.5 ml tube. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for5 min at 4 \u25e6C and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. Lysateswere quantified by Bradford assay and equal amounts of total pro-tein were used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-p120ctn(mAb 15D2, BD Transduction Laboratories. Lexington KY, USA; mAb6H11, a gift from Dr. Reynolds, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,USA) or anti-Kaiso pAb (a gift from Dr. Juliet M. Daniel, Departmentof Biology, McMaster University). The immunocomplexes were thensubjected to SDS-PAGE.After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred from the gel to anitrocellulose membrane using the Hoeffer semi-dry transfer appa-ratus (Amersham/Pharmacia, San Francisco, CA). The membranewas then briefly blocked at room temperature with 3% milk in TBSpH 7.4 before incubating at 4 \u25e6C overnight with anti-Kaiso mAb (agift from Dr. Juliet M. Daniel, Department of Biology, McMaster Uni-versity) used at 2 \ufffdg/ml in 3% milk-TBS. The primary antibodieswere removed by washing with TBS and the membranes incu-bated for 2 h at RT with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mousesecondary antibody, diluted 1:40,000 in 3% milk-TBS. Membraneswere finally rinsed five times with water, once with TBS pH 7.4 for5 min, and processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)system (Amersham/Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer\u2019sprotocols.2.8. Statistical analysisSPSS v13.0 software for Windows (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA)was used for statistical analysis. The \ufffd2-test was used to analyzethe relationship between the expression of Kaiso and p120ctn andclinicopathological factors. McNemar\u2019s test was used to assess thedifference between expression of Kaiso and p120ctn in primarylung cancer and lymph node metastasis cancer. The independent-samples T test was used to analyze the results of RT-PCR andCTEDWestern blot. The prognostic significance of p120ctn and Kaisoexpression concerning other pathological variables was assessedusing multivariate Cox proportional hazard\u2019s analysis. A P value ofless than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All tests andP values were bilateral.2 Cance33ofatps(mfi(wthTsKssb(srlp(srTFbeflo08 S.-D. Dai et al. / Lung. Results.1. Expressions of Kaiso and p120ctn were correlated with eachther, and associated with the malignancy of lung cancerKaiso was expressed weakly in the epithelial cells of bronchusrom all 20 normal pulmonary tissues and primarily localized on thepiculus of these cells (Fig. 1A). According to our evaluation criteria,hey were judged as negative expression. The positive rate of cyto-lasmic Kaiso expression in lung cancer tissue was 58.7% (115/196),ignificantly higher than that in normal bronchial epithelial cellsP < 0.001). We also examined the relationship between cytoplas-ic Kaiso expression and clinicopathological factors (Table 1). Weound that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression occurred more frequentlyn samples with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasisP = 0.004, P < 0.001, respectively), while no significant associationsere found with regard to age, sex, histological type or differen-iation (Table 1). Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was significantlyigher in stages II + III + IV lung cancers than in stage I (P = 0.004,able 1). In 124 cases with lymph node metastasis, 85 (68.5%)howed cytoplasmic Kaiso expression, and 39 (31.5%) showed noaiso expression. While in 72 cases without lymph node metasta-is, 30 (41.7%) showed cytoplasmic Kaiso expression, and 42 (58.4%)howed no Kaiso expression. There was a significant correlationetween cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and lymph node metastasisP < 0.001, Table 1). Nuclear staining of Kaiso was seen in occa-ional tumor cells but only with a 5.61% (11/196) positive expressionate and not associated with any clinicopathological features ofung cancer (data not shown). In the 55 paired comparison sam-les, the positive rate of cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was 72.7%40/55) in primary sites and 90.9% (50/55) in lymph node metasta-is lesions. Lymph node metastases showed an increased expressionate in cytoplasmic Kaiso, compared to primary tumors (P = 0.001,able 2B).ig. 1.

(For interpretation of tf the article.)RETRAr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215Expression of p120ctn occurs mainly in the cell membrane ofnormal bronchial epithelium (Fig. 1C). Of 196 lung cancers, 28(14.29%) showed normal or preserved membranous expressiononly, and 168 (85.71%) showed abnormal expression, includ-ing reduced membranous expression, preserved membranousexpression accompanied with ectopic cytoplasmic expression,and reduced or absent membranous expression together withectopic cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 2A and E). Next, we examinedassociations between abnormal expression of p120ctn and clini-copathological factors (Table 1). We found that abnormal p120ctnexpression occurred more frequently in samples with advancedtumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.016, P < 0.001, respec-tively), while no significant association was found with regard toage, sex, histological type and differentiation (Table 1).The expression of p120ctn in the 55 cases for which paired datawere available is summarized in Table 2. Abnormal p120ctn expres-sion (reduced membranous expression and/or ectopic cytoplasmicexpression) was detected in 81.8% (45/55) of primary sites and96.36% (53/55) in the lymph node metastases. Lymph node metas-tases showed significantly higher abnormal p120ctn expression,compared to primary tumors (P = 0.002) (Table 2B).As shown in Fig. 2, Kaiso and p120ctn often exhibited cytoplas-mic co-localization not only in primary lesions but also in lymphanode metastases. The immunohistochemical staining results ofconsecutive sections showed that p120ctn ectopic cytoplasmicexpression frequently accompanied with cytoplasmic Kaiso expres-sion. We confirmed this observation widely existed in lung cancertissues regardless of clinical and histological features (such ashistological type and lymph node metastasis status). Next, we car-ried out statistic analysis to confirm the significantly relationshipTEDbetween cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and ectopic cytoplasmicp120ctn expression. Of 196 primary lung cancers, cytoplasmic Kaisoexpression correlates with ectopic cytoplasmic p120ctn expression(Kappa = 0.269, P < 0.001; Table 2A). The same was true for pri-cells.

Expression of Kaiso and p120ctn and survival timeIn order to obtain prognostic data more quickly, immunohisto-chemistry was performed on partial lung cancer paraffin embeddedtissues from 5 years ago to determine the expression of Kaiso andp120ctn.

DiscussionKaiso is a nuclear protein that plays a role in transcriptionrepression [23\u201325,37,38]. It belongs to the BTB/POZ (Broad Com-plex, Tramtrak, Bric a\u2019 brac/Pox virus and Zinc finger) familyof proteins [39]. BTB/POZ proteins contain an amino-terminalBTB/POZ domain that engages in protein\u2013protein interactions(dimerization and corepressor interactions) and a carboxyl-S.-D.

Among the BTB/POZ proteins, Kaiso appears to benique in possessing dual specificity, recognizing both sequence-pecific consensus sites and methylated CpG dinucleotides21,41\u201343].In this study, we found that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression corre-ate with ectopic cytoplasmic p120ctn expression in lung cancery immunohistochemistry. Next, co-immunoprecipitation assaylearly confirmed that Kaiso and p120ctn coassociated with eachther in cytoplasm of lung cancer cells. Immunohistochemicaltudy demonstrated that all 13 lung cancer tissues utilized in the co-mmunoprecipitation assay only with synergistically cytoplasmicaiso and p120ctn expression. No nuclear staining can be detectedn these tissues. This is apparently the only report directly revealsaiso\u2013p120ctn complex exists in cytoplasm.The relationships between the expression of p120ctn and Kaiso,s well as their correlation with clinical and pathological factors ofancer, are poorly defined [44,45]. Herein, we found that Kaiso cyto-lasmic expression and p120ctn abnormal expression were morepparent in tumors with higher degree of malignancy (high-stage,odal metastasis) and significantly correlated with poor progno-is of the patients. Moreover, immunohistochemical results of 55aired cases of lung cancer demonstrated that abnormal p120ctnxpression and cytoplasmic Kaiso expression were significantlyigher in lymph node metastasis than that in primary cancer. Inddition, Cox model multivariate analysis reveals that abnormal120ctn expression is the major and independent factors defin-ng the clinicopathological characters of patients while cytoplasmicaiso may be an independent factor affecting prognosis, with a P-alue of 0.062. It seems important to collect more patient follow-upecords to clarify this correlation between Kaiso expression andpatient\u2019s clinical response. Kaiso may exert an oncogenic func-ion in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells. It may therefore beorthwhile in the future to analyze the effect of Kaiso on cellroliferation and transformation by Kaiso overexpression or knock-own. Our p120ctn knockdown results obtained from SPC cellsRETRAsiRNA-SPC) showed that p120ctn ablation increased Kaiso local-zation in nucleus, suggesting p120ctn takes part in Kaiso exportrom nucleus. It has been reported that no nuclear export signalsNES) existed in Kaiso while two NES presented in p120ctn [46].onsidering the close relationship between Kaiso and p120ctn,xtract, compare to A549 cells. Lower, p120ctn mAb 6H11, which recognize only theforms of p120ctn, coprecipitated Kaiso from whole cell lysates. (For interpretationthe article.)it is plausible that p120ctn participates in Kaiso exit from thenucleus. A functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) is presentupstream of the zinc finger domain in Kaiso and Kaiso enters thenucleus by the classical importin-\ufffd/\ufffd pathway [26]. However, it isstill unknown whether p120ctn plays a role in the entry of Kaisointo the nucleus. Our data obtained from p120ctn knockdown BE1cells (siRNA-BE1) suggested that p120ctn could assist the entryof Kaiso into the nucleus. We also noticed that results got fromthese two cell lines were somewhat contradictory. This discrep-ancy may be due to different cell lines employed in this study, mostlikely the initial p120ctn levels. As shown in Fig. 5B, BE1 cell linesexpress high levels of p120ctn (more isoform 1 than isoform 3) andSPC cell lines express middle levels of p120ctn (more isoform 3than isoform 1). The details still need us to address in our futureresearch.The results got from stably overexpressed p120ctn isoforms 1Aand 3A cells (designated A549-1A and A549-3A cells) demonstratethat both of these two isoforms overexpression could increase Kaisoexpression in cytoplasm and nucleus. But difference also can befound, p120ctn isoform 3 seems exert more effort on Kaiso\u2019s sub-cellular localization. Our binding studies further suggest that onlyp120ctn isoform 3 directly binds to Kaiso. This result consistentswith report by Daniel and Reynolds [20]. In that study, they foundthat Kaiso might only directly bind with p120ctn isoform 3 butdid not absolute exclude the possible binding between Kaiso andp120ctn isoform 1, for cell lines employed in their study expressvery low levels of p120ctn isoform 1. This possible interaction canbe eliminated by our result of co-immunoprecipitation assay, forp120ctn isoform 1 had been significantly upregulated in A549-1A cells. How p120ctn isoform 1 affects the localization of Kaiso,although they did not directly interact, is an interesting problem toclarify.Our study showed that p120ctn depletion or overexpression didnot influence Kaiso transcription, but did influence Kaiso proteinexpression. These results demonstrate that p120ctn only regulatesKaiso at the protein level, rather than by affecting Kaiso gene tran-CTEscription. Park et al. [47] have demonstrated that Frodo depletion(Frodo-morpholino [Frodo-MO] injection) resulted in significantlydecreased p120ctn levels, while, in contrast, the amount of Kaisoprotein remained unchanged. This apparently contradictory find-ings of two different studies could be explained by the fact that,2 Canceicm[5posmaoupKCrAc1tUcSWR[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[A14 S.-D. Dai et al. / Lungn the Jae-il Park study, Xenopus embryos were used rather thanancer cell lines and the regulation mechanism of p120ctn on Kaisoight not be the same under physiological/pathological conditions44].. ConclusionOur data showed that abnormal p120ctn expression and cyto-lasmic Kaiso expression significantly correlated to higher degreef malignancy (high-stage, nodal metastasis) and poor progno-is of the NSCLC patients. Abnormal p120ctn expression is theajor and independent factor defining the clinicopathological char-cters of patients. Kaiso\u2013p120ctn complex exists in cytoplasmf lung cancer cells. Although both p120ctn isoforms can reg-late subcellular localization and protein levels of Kaiso, only120ctn isoform 3, but not isoform 1, directly interacts withaiso.onflict of interest statementNone of the authors of this manuscript have a financial interestelated to this work.cknowledgementWe sincerely thank Dr. Albert B.
