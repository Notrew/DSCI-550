Franco, Bowen Wang, Stephen Seedial,K. Craig Kent*Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of AmericaAbstractAtherosclerotic-associated diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite recent progress,interventional treatments for atherosclerosis can be complicated by restenosis resulting from neo-intimal hyperplasia. Wehave previously demonstrated that TGF-b and its downstream signaling protein Smad3:1) are up-regulated followingvascular injury, 2) together drive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration and 3) enhance the development ofintimal hyperplasia. In order to determine a mechanism through which TGF-b/Smad3 promote these effects, Affymetrixgene expression arrays were performed on primary rat SMCs infected with Smad3 and stimulated with TGF-b or infectedwith GFP alone. More than 200 genes were differentially expressed (.2.0 fold change, p,0.05) in TGF-b/Smad3 stimulatedSMCs. We then performed GO term enrichment analysis using the DAVID bioinformatics database and found that TGF-b/Smad3 activated the expression of multiple genes related to either development or cell differentiation, several of whichhave been shown to be associated with multipotent stem or progenitor cells. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed up-regulation of several developmental genes including FGF1, NGF, and Wnt11 (by 2.5, 6 and 7 fold, respectively) as well asstem/progenitor cell associated genes CD34 and CXCR4 (by 10 and 45 fold, respectively). In addition, up-regulation of thesefactors at protein levels were also confirmed by Western blotting, or by immunocytochemistry (performed for CXCR4 andNGF). Finally, TGF-b/Smad3 down regulated transcription of SMC contractile genes as well as protein production of smoothmuscle alpha actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. These combined results suggest that TGF-b/Smad3stimulation drives SMCs to a phenotypically altered state of de-differentiation through the up-regulation of developmentalrelated genes.Citation: Shi X, DiRenzo D, Guo L-W, Franco SR, Wang B, et al.

Each year over a millionvascular reconstructions are performed to restore circulation toischemic organs. Unfortunately, a good number of theseeventually fail due to intimal hyperplasia which re-narrows thevessel lumen. Currently, the only clinical approach to preventrestenosis is the drug eluting stent, which is implanted into a vesselfollowing angioplasty, releasing drugs such as rapamycin orpaclitaxel. Even with the use of these stents, the incidence ofrestenosis remains ,15% in the coronary arteries and higher inthe peripheral circulation [1]. Moreover, patients are predisposedto a risk of thrombosis resulting in sudden death. Therefore, it isimperative to further delineate the underlying mechanisms ofrestenosis with the goal of devising better strategies for prevention.Intimal hyperplasia, or injury-triggered growth of the subintimallayer of an artery or vein is the primary pathological event leadingto restenosis. Essential to this process is the transformation ofmedial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from a quiescent andcontractile state to a synthetic phenotype, active in the productionof extracellular matrix [2]. These \u2018\u2018activated\u2019\u2019 cells quickly multiplyand migrate into the subintimal space forming a highly cellularneointimal plaque. While attracting enormous interest, the natureof this SMC phenotypic transformation has remained controver-sial. A common observation is that injury-stimulated SMCs re-gainthe ability to proliferate and migrate while losing signature SMCcharacteristics, i.e. loss of the spindle morphology and a decrease inSMC markers such as smooth muscle actin (SMA), calponin, andmyosin heavy chain (MHC). It has been hypothesized by somethat SMCs, in response to injury, switch to a phenotypicallymodulated state [2]. However, in a recent study, it washypothesized that this \u2018\u2018synthetic\u2019\u2019 cell population is derived fromresident stem cells in the media, rather than de-differentiation ofmature medial SMCs [3].PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093995&domain=pdfTGF-b is known to be a regulator of a great number of celltypes. Following ligand binding, the TGF-b receptor heterodimeris activated and phosphorylates the two cognate Smads, Smad2and Smad3, which then bind to Smad4. The resulting complextranslocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of aplethora of genes by binding to their promoters [4]. Theregulatory power of Smad3 as a master transcription factor isaugmented or modulated by interactions with some 50 co-transcription factors. Aside from these canonical pathways,TGF-b is also able to regulate gene expression through non-canonical pathways, typically MAPK including ERK, JNK, andp38. Moreover, these noncanonical pathways crosstalk with thecanonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway forming a complex TGF-bsignaling network. As such, TGF-b function can vary and dependsupon cell type, the extracellular environment, as well as thesignaling context [4].TGF-b has been found to be an inhibitor of proliferation inmany cell types including cancer cells. In vascular SMCs we andseveral other groups have observed in vitro, that TGF-b inhibits cellproliferation as well as migration [5,6,7]. This is surprising in thatTGF-b has been found to enhance the formation of intimalhyperplasia at the time of arterial injury, which is characterized bySMC proliferation and migration [8]. Our group has found thatthe anti-proliferative effect of TGF-b is reversed in the presence ofelevated Smad3 expression, and Smad3 expression is enhancedfollowing arterial injury. Moreover, adenoviral expression ofSmad3 following arterial injury exacerbates the formation ofintimal hyperplasia [6]. Thus, in a background of elevated Smad3,the function of TGF-b in SMCs is paradoxically opposite of theanti-proliferative effect generally observed in cell culture. Wereason that when Smad3 protein is increased (in vitro or in vivo), thecanonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway may over-ride other TGF-b-associated pathways and dominate the TGF-b signaling network,leading to an altered outcome in SMC behavior. We hypothesizethat TGF-b/Smad3 signaling alters the expression profile of theSmad3-responsive genome thus driving SMCs to a distinct, de-differentiated fate.In order to investigate the TGF-b/Smad3-directed SMCtranscriptome, we performed gene array following TGF-bstimulation of primary rat aortic SMCs transduced with anadenovirus expressing Smad3, mimicking the in vivo condition ofTGF-b and Smad3 elevation following arterial injury. Interest-ingly, our data reveal, in response to TGF-b/Smad3, up-regulation of a large number of genes associated with developmentand/or multipotent stem cells or progenitor cells. Our findingssuggest a novel mechanism whereby elevated TGF-b/Smad3reverses the developmental lineage to a de-differentiated state.These findings provide novel, important insight into the disparatefunction of TGF-b in vitro and in vivo as well as the molecularmechanisms of intimal hyperplasia.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementThe experiments involving animal use were carried out in strictaccordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Careand Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes ofHealth. The protocol (Permit Number: M02273) was approved bythe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison. All surgery was performedunder isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimizesuffering.ReagentsRecombinant human TGF-b1 was purchased from R&DSystems (Minneapolis, MN). Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium(DMEM) and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen(Carlsbad, CA). All the other reagents were from Sigma (St. LouisMO) unless otherwise specified.Smooth Muscle Cell Culture and Viral InfectionRat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolatedfrom the thoracoabdominal aorta of male Sprague-Dawley ratsbased on a protocol described by Clowes et al. [9]. Vascular SMCswere used at passages 5 to 6 for all experiments and weremaintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovinesolution (FBS) at 37uC with 5% CO2. For experiments involvingSmad3 overexpression, vascular SMCs were infected withadenovirus (36104 particles/cell) expressing Smad3 (or GFPcontrol) in DMEM containing 2% FBS for 4 h at 37uC followedby recovery in media containing 10% FBS. After overnightincubation, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for24 h. The cells were then treated with recombinant TGF-b (5 ng/ml) or solvent for desired hours. For microarray analysis, passage5 SMCs from 3 different animals were infected with AdSmad3 orAdGFP control followed by treatment with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) orsolvent (for GFP control) for 24h. Adenoviral vectors expressingSmad3 (AdSmad3) and GFP (AdGFP) were constructed aspreviously described [7].RNA Isolation and Quality ControlTotal RNA from SMCs treated with AdSmad3 and TGF-b orAdGFP alone was isolated using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Mini Kit(Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. For quality control, 1 mg of total RNA was analyzed bycapillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip andthe Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,CA). All RNA samples used in this study showed no sign ofdegradation.MicroarrayMicroarray was carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). Whole transcripttarget labeling was carried out with total RNA using Ambion\u2019sexpression kit to generate terminal labeled cDNA (Austin, TX).Labeled cDNA was hybridized to rat Genechip (Rat Gene 1.0 STArray) overnight in the AFX HybOven480 (Santa Clara, CA), andthen post-processed on the Fluidics450 station. Post-hybridizationwashing was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The microarray slides were scanned on a G7 scanner (Affymetrix,Santa Clara, CA). Data were extracted using the Affyrmetrixconsole software. The complete data set is available at GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO Accession: GSE54624).Basic AnalysesThe fold changes of gene expression, P values and heat mapswere calculated using the ArrayStar software (DNASTAR, Inc.,Madison, WI). A moderated t-test was performed to identifyputative genes with significant expression changes. Putative genesthat were up or down regulated more than 2-fold with a P valueless than 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed andselected for further analysis.Functional Analysis of Significantly Affected GenesGenes that were up or down regulated more than 2 fold (P,0.05) after TGF-b/Smad3 treatment compared to GFP controlTGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation GenesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995were submitted to David Bioinformatics Resources 6.7, NIAID/NIH (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). The overall functions regu-lated by these TGF-b/Smad3 modulated genes were identified byFunctional Annotation Clustering and ranked by enrichmentscores.Real-time Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)mRNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,Valencia, CA). Potential contaminating genomic DNA wasremoved by using gDNA Eliminator columns provided in thekit. The purified mRNA (2 mg) was used for the first-strand cDNAsynthesis and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,CA). Each cDNA template was amplified in triplicates usingSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,CA) with gene specific primers.Western Blotting AnalysisCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containingProtease Inhibitor Cocktail I (Millipore,Billerica, MA). Proteinconcentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit(Hercules, CA). Thirty micrograms of proteins from each samplewere separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocel-lulose membranes. Protein levels were assessed by immunoblottingwith the following rabbit antibodies for FGF-1, NGF, Wnt11,CXCR4, CD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),calponin, and myosin heavy chain (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),mouse antibodies for a-smooth muscle actin and b-actin (Sigma,St. Louis, MO). After incubation with appropriate primaryantibodies and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondaryantibodies, the specific protein bands on the membranes werevisualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce,Davenport, IL).ImmunocytochemistryImmunostaining was performed to detect in situ the expressionof CXCR4 and NGF in SMCs, following our published method.Cells were prepared by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSfor 10 minutes. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% tritonx-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA/5% donkey serumfor 1 h. Primary antibody was applied overnight at 4uC, and thena secondary antibody was incubated with the cells for 1 h at roomtemperature followed by fluorescence microscopy.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis of the data other than microarray results wasconducted using a one\u2013way analysis of variance (ANOVA) anddata were presented as mean 6 SEM derived from at least threeindependent experiments, unless otherwise stated. If significant,the ANOVA was followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. Pvalue less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.ResultsStimulation of Vascular SMCs with TGF-b/Smad3 DrivesLarge-scale Gene ExpressionThe genome-wide changes in mRNA expression that occur inSMCs in response to enhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling are ofgreat interest and will provide significant insight into the role ofTGF-b in the development of restenosis. To identify which genesare influenced, rat primary SMCs were infected with adenoviralvectors expressing human Smad3 or control GFP. SMC cultureswere serum-starved for 24 hours and the Smad3 group wasstimulated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours prior to RNAisolation and Affymetrix gene expression array analysis. Bycomparing control (AdGFP) SMCs to cells expressing Smad3and stimulated by TGF-b our goal was to mimic a comparisonbetween uninjured artery with low levels of TGF-b and Smad3and injured artery with increased expression of both proteins. Thiscombined TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation led to the significant (p,0.05) (.2.0 fold) changes in the expression levels of 219 genes with143 genes up-regulated and 76 genes down-regulated (Figure 1A).Although we used p,0.05 as our threshold and a two-fold changein expression, 289 additional genes were observed that had astatistically significant (p,0.05) change in gene expression but thenumerical change was not greater than 2.0 fold (Figure 1B).Additionally, there were 466 genes that exhibited a greater than2.0 fold change in gene expression but these differences did notreach statistical significance (Figure 1B). Although the criteria usedto select the 219 genes that are the focus of this analysis werereasonably stringent, there are clearly additional genes that areaffected by the combination of TGF-b and Smad3. Nevertheless,the findings from this gene expression array demonstrate thatcombined TGF-b/Smad3 signaling leads to changes in expressionof a large number of genes that are potentially responsible for thealtered cellular state of SMCs following in vivo vascular injury.DAVID GO-term Analysis of TGF-b/Smad3 DifferentiallyRegulated GenesAdditional studies were then performed to identify the putativebiological function of these 219 genes. In order to betterunderstand the consequences of TGF-b/Smad3 activation ofSMCs we utilized the DAVID bioinformatics database (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) to determine enriched gene ontology(GO) terms. The gene ontology project provides a controlledvocabulary of terms for describing gene product characteristicsand gene product annotation data from the published literature.These terms are designed to establish a universal vocabulary fordescribing the molecular function, biological processes, andcellular component associated with every gene in the genome.For this particular analysis, DAVID identified significantlyenriched biological processes associated with our list of 219differentially expressed genes and clustered these into functionalcategories. The top 20 functional categories, based on enrichmentscore, are displayed in Figure 2 and the entire data set can befound in Table S1. Interestingly, the most enriched functionalcategory with an enrichment score of 5.9 is \u2018\u2018DevelopmentalProcess,\u2019\u2019 suggesting that SMCs stimulated by TGF-b/Smad3 mayreactivate a developmental pattern of gene expression. Included inthe top 20 were other functional categories relating to thedevelopmental processes including \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Differen-tiation,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Branching Tube Morphogenesis,\u2019\u2019 Respiratory SystemDevelopment,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Limb Development,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Immune systemDevelopment\u2019\u2019 (Figure 2). Although categories related to develop-ment of the limb, respiratory, and immune systems seemcounterintuitive, it is probable that similar genes function in thedevelopment of multiple organ systems, including the vascularsystem. In sum, these results reinforce the notion that SMCs, whenexposed to Smad3 and TGF-b, reactivate a pattern of develop-mental gene expression.Following vascular injury and as a precursor to intimalhyperplasia, SMCs migrate, become proliferative and are resistantto apoptosis. In SMCs activated by Smad3 and TGF-b weobserved functional categories of genes that promote all three ofthese processes. Inclusive within the top 20 functional categorieswere \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Migration,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Regulation of CellTGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation GenesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/Response/Chemotaxis,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Negative Regulation of Cell Migration\u2019\u2019and \u2018\u2018Positive Regulation of Cell Migration\u2019\u2019 showing that multiplegenes affected by TGF-b/Smad3 influence SMC migration. Also,\u2018\u2018Negative Regulation of Cell Apoptosis\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Regulation ofApoptosis\u2019\u2019 indicate that TGF-b/Smad3 may have a significanteffect on SMC apoptosis. Finally, \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Growth\u2019\u2019and \u2018\u2018Leukocyte Proliferation\u2019\u2019 suggest that TGF-b/Smad3activation of SMCs can also influence proliferation. In ourprevious studies we have demonstrated that TGF-b/Smad3stimulation is capable of enhancing proliferation and migrationand protecting against apoptosis of vascular SMCs therebycontributing to the development of neo-intimal hyperplasia. Theidentification of these enriched categories provides potentialmechanisms for our previous findings.Taken together, the DAVID GO-term enrichment analysisreinforces that TGF-b/Smad3 activates genes associated with de-differentiation/differentiation as well as SMC proliferation,migration and apoptosis. The sum of these effects may providean explanation why TGF-b/Smad3 have such a potent stimula-tory effect on the development of intimal hyperplasia.Categorization of Developmental Related GenesThe \u2018\u2018Developmental Process\u2019\u2019 is the most enriched functionalcategory populated by the 219 differentially expressed genesinduced by TGF-b/Smad3. We combined the various functionalclusters and generated a list of 60 genes that are related todevelopment/differentiation/or de-differentiation. To better un-derstand the role of these 60 genes in SMC behavior we conductedan extensive literature search and classified each into one of threemajor categories: \u2018\u2018de-differentiation related,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018differentiationrelated,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018other developmental related.\u2019\u2019 TGF-b/Smad3treatment of SMCs significantly regulated a cluster of 17 genesthat have been previously associated with de-differentiation in oneor more cell types (Table 1). We also identified an additional 34genes that, in at least one cellular system, have been found to beassociated with cell differentiation (Table 2). There were anadditional 9 developmental genes that we could not categorize asassociated with de-differentiation or differentiation (Table 3).For those 17 de-differentiation genes, the degree of de-differentiation might be further subdivided into a hierarchy ofprogenitor cells being the least de-differentiated, followed bymultipotent cells and then pluripotent cells as the most de-differentiated. A single gene was found to be associated withpluripotency. This gene, telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Terf1),is essential for the protection of telomere ends and induction ofinduced pluripotent stem cells from somatic precursors [10]. Incontrast, we found several genes associated with multipotenthematopoietic stem cells including the stem cell chemoattractant,CXCL12 (SDF-1) and its corresponding receptor CXCR4.Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is also included in the de-differentiation table in that it has been shown to inhibit thedifferentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into myeloid cells [11].In addition, several genes associated with multipotent mesenchy-mal stem cells were also observed. The secreted factors FGF1 andHB-EGF have both been shown to play essential roles inmesenchymal stem cell renewal and inhibition of spontaneousdifferentiation [12,13,14]. Likewise, Gremlin-1 (Grem1) andWnt9a expression are responsible for maintaining a populationof mesenchymal stem cells in a pre-osteoblast state [15,16]whereas expression of PTH-LH inhibits chondrocyte differentia-tion from mesenchymal stem cell precursors [17]. We alsoidentified 5 genes from the de-differentiation category that areinvolved in progenitor cell activity. Interestingly, these genes wereshown to inhibit the differentiation of local progenitor cells intotheir adult counterparts in various tissues including: for skinkeratinocytes, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2); forblood cell progenitors, Sox18; for chondrocyte progenitors,Chordin-like 2 (Chrdl2); and for retinal progenitor cells, Wnt2b[18,19,20,21]. Of most relevance to vascular disease, ForkheadFigure 1. TGF-b/Smad3 treatment significantly affects gene expression in vascular SMCs. Cultured rat vascular SMCs were infected withan adenovirus expressing Smad3 (AdSmad3) and treated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for 24 h.

These genes can modulate thede-differentiation of SMCs into stem-like cells which regainplasticity with increased capacity to proliferate and migrate.Validation of Array Data for TGF-b/Smad3 GeneExpression by qRT-PCRQuantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to corrobo-rate our microarray findings for TGF-b/Smad3 regulated geneexpression. The Affymetrix gene array revealed a number ofintriguing genes regulated by TGF-b/Smad3 and up-regulation ofseveral that have been previously reported to be associated withde-differentiation. To confirm the microarray results, SMCs wereinfected with AdGFP or AdSmad3 and then treated with solventor TGF-b. The mRNA levels of several highly regulated genesassociated with development were evaluated by qRT-PCR(Figure 3). We initially evaluated three genes due to their well-established roles in the development of a variety of mammaliantissue including vascular, epithelium, and neuronal tissue. Theresults of qRT-PCR were in agreement with microarray resultswith regard to the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1),nerve growth factor (NGF) and wingless-related MMTV integra-tion site 11 (Wnt11). FGF1 was elevated ,2.5 fold in TGF-b/Smad3-stimulated cells compared to GFP control, whereas NGFand Wnt11 were up-regulated ,6 fold and ,7 fold, respectively(Figure 3). Although all these genes were elevated, there weredifferences in the expression profiles of each. For Wnt11, TGF-balone produced an effect on gene expression that was almost assignificant as that found with combined TGF-b/Smad3 stimula-tion. In contrast, FGF1 and NGf up-regulation by TGF-b washeavily reliant on the presence of elevated levels of Smad3(Figure 3A). We further confirmed up-regulation of proteinproduction of these 3 factors. Western blotting showed an ,2.5\u20133 fold increase of all 3 proteins either in SMC lysates (Figure 3B)or cell culture media (Figure 3C), as a result of TGF-b/Smad3treatment. Following the treatment with AdSmad3 alone (noTGF-b), while only FGF-1 was significantly up-regulated in celllysates, all 3 factors were significantly increased in conditionedmedia.In additional experiments we evaluated expression of CXCR4and CD34, both stem/progenitor associated genes. The qRT-PCR data indicate that CXCR4 and CD34 mRNA levels wereincreased by ,10 fold and 45 fold, respectively, after TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation (Figure 4A); Western blotting confirmed anincrease of these two proteins in cell lysates albeit to a lower extent(,3 fold) (Figure 4B). In order to understand the temporalexpression profiles of these two genes, we determined the qRT-PCR time course. SMCs were infected with AdSmad3 and treatedwith TGF-b (5ng/ml) for the indicated times, AdGFP served as acontrol. TGF-b/Smad3 gradually and consistently increasedCD34 expression to 30 fold at 12 hours and to a maximum of50 fold at 48 hours. In contrast, CXCR4 was enhanced andpeaked at 50 fold at 6 hours then gradually fell to 10-fold by 48hours (Figure 4C). These results further validate the array findingsand confirm that TGF-b/Smad3 activate two additional genesassociated with cell development. Interestingly, the time course ofeach differs with CXCR4 associated with a peak in expression at 6hours and CD34 expression gradually increasing over time.Using immunocytochemistry we then determined the percent-age of SMCs that express development/progenitor associatedgenes in response to the combined stimulation of AdSmad3 andTGF-b. In order to avoid an interference of GFP fluorescence withFigure 2. Functional role of TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes.Significantly regulated genes after AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment (.2-foldchange and P,0.05) were submitted to David Bioinformatics Resources6.7 (NIH, NIAID) for functional analysis. TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genesare associated with multiple functions based upon clustering annota-tion measured by Fisher Exact in the DAVID system. The enrichmentscores represent the relative importance of the function of each theregulated genes. An enrichment score of 1.3 is similar to P,0.05.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093995.g002TGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation GenesPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995microscopic detection of immunostained proteins, we sought touse GFP as a surrogate of viral expression of Smad3 because theadenoviral vector was designed to co-express GFP and Smad3.Indeed, after AdSmad3 infection and TGF-b treatment, over 90%of GFP-expressing SMCs were Smad3-overexpressing cells (FigureS1 in File S1). We then immunostained two representative factors,NGF and CXCR4, in AdGFP and AdSmad3 infected (and TGF-btreated) cells. We found that ,60% of GFP cells were NGf andCXCR4 positive cells (Figure 5), indicating a strong association ofup-regulation of these factors with Smad3 expression.In sum, through determination of mRNA, protein, and in situcellular expression, we have confirmed significant up-regulation offive genes, all of which were found by the Affymetrix geneexpression array to be associated with SMC development.TGF-b/Smad3 Negatively Regulates SMC DifferentiationTGF-b is classically considered a stimulant of SMC differen-tiation [23,24,25,26]. However, the foregoing suggests that in thecontext of elevated Smad3, TGF-b promotes de-differentiation.Consistent with this hypothesis, we propose that TGF-b/Smad3might also inhibit SMC differentiation. To explore this possibility,using qRT-PCR we evaluated the effect of TGF-b/Smad3 onexpression of smooth muscle actin (SMA), Calponin, and smoothmuscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), which are three proteinsknown to be associated with SMC differentiation. SMCs wereinfected with AdSmad3 and treated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for24 h or infected with AdGFP. qRT-PCR revealed that activationof the TGF-b/Smad3 pathway significantly decreased theexpression of the SMC contractile genes, SMA, Calponin, SM-MHC to approximately 60% of control (Figure 6A); eitherAdSmad3 or TGF-b alone did not produce a significant change(Figure S2 in File S1). These findings were then confirmed byWestern blotting, using an identical experimental protocol. Proteinlevels associated with each of these genes fell to approximately50% of control (Figure 6B, C). Thus, our findings suggest thatTGF-b/Smad3 not only enhance expression of factors thatpromote cellular de-differentiation but also inhibit factors thathave been previously found to be associated with differentiation orpreservation of the SMCs in a quiescent, contractile state.Whereas TGF-b alone has been strongly associated with SMCdifferentiation, the sum of our findings suggest that in the presenceof elevated Smad3, TGF-b transforms into a potent stimulant ofSMC de-differentiation.DiscussionTGF-b is a critically important factor in the development ofintimal hyperplasia. Its expression is up-regulated in arteries andveins following vascular reconstruction. Moreover, increasingTGF-b through viral expression in an animal model of arterialinjury exacerbates intimal hyperplasia, whereas inhibiting TGF-bsignaling by using antibodies or by expressing a soluble form of theTGF-b receptor attenuates it [8]. These findings are surprisingsince, TGF-b, in vitro, is a potent inhibitor of SMC proliferationand migration, both necessary contributors to intimal hyperplasia.Our recent published findings bring some resolution to thisconundrum. It appears that TGF-b in the presence of elevatedlevels of its canonical signaling protein Smad3, transforms from aninhibitor of SMC proliferation and migration to a stimulant ofboth processes. We have previously demonstrated that adminis-tration of TGF-b to cultured SMCs coupled with adenoviraloverexpression of Smad3, leads to enhanced proliferation,migration, and synthesis of extracellular matrix [6,27,28,29].These results are mirrored in vivo where overexpression of Smad3was found to enhance balloon injury-induced intimal hyperplasiain rat carotid arteries [6,29]. While transfection with siRNA toreduce Smad3 levels reversed SMC proliferation stimulated byAdSmad3 [63], adenoviral expression of Smad7, which blocksSmad3 signaling, effectively inhibited intimal hyperplasia [6].Despite the current knowledge that TGF-b/Smad3 play crucialroles in stimulating SMC proliferation, migration and intimalhyperplasia in response to arterial injury, changes in geneexpression and the mechanism behind this response remainTable 1.

We performed the Affymetrix gene expression arrays onSMCs infected with AdSmad3 and stimulated by TGF-b, with theassumption that identification of genes regulated by the combina-tion of TGF-b/Smad3 may provide important insight into howthis signaling axis affects intimal hyperplasia. We identified 219genes whose expression was substantially altered (.2 fold change,p,0.05). We then applied DAVID bioinformatics tools to analyzeTGF-b/Samd3 regulated gene functions. The most salient findingof this analysis was that the most prominently regulated genes werethose related to development, some of which are associated withstem or progenitor cells. It is likely that expression of thesedevelopmental and stem cell-related genes is indicative that TGF-b/Smad3 at minimum produces SMC de-differentiation or atmaximum transforms SMCs into stem or progenitor cells followingvascular injury.It has been thought for many years that for neointimalhyperplasia to occur, a transformation of medial SMCs isnecessary to allow for their migration to and proliferation withinthe subintimal space. Classically, this process has been described as\u2018\u2018phenotypic switching\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018phenotypic modulation\u2019\u2019 wherebySMCs transition from quiescent and contractile to synthetic cellsfollowing vascular injury [2,30]. As a consequence, SMCs reducetheir expression of contractile genes, most notably smooth musclealpha-actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chainwhile up-regulating expression of genes that lead to the productionof extracellular matrix [2,30]. A variety of factors released at thetime of arterial injury, including PDGF-BB, PDGF-DD, oxidizedphospholipids and extracellular matrix proteins, have beenimplicated in the transformation of SMCs from a contractile toa synthetic phenotype [31,32,33,34]. Furthermore, many of thesestimulants exert their function through the intra-cellular signalingTable 2.

The concept that SMCs express stem cell-related genes following arterial injury is not entirely novel and hasbeen suggested by recent studies. Our group has previouslyreported the presence of the stem cell factor, C-kit, in vascularSMCs derived from human saphenous vein. Moreover, we founda substantial increase in C-kit in hyperplastic plaque that developsin the rat carotid model of intimal hyperplasia [37]. Ferlosio et al.demonstrated an increase in the percentage of medial cellsexpressing the stem cell markers flt-1 and c-kit in large arteries ofaged humans and rats versus younger controls [38]. SMCs isolatedfrom aged rats were also more proliferative, migratory andexpressed less SMC alpha actin compared to younger controls[38]. These findings reinforce the notion that SMCs up-regulatestem cell-associated genes in response to injury or chronic stresssuch as aging.Additional evidence that SMCs can activate stem cell geneexpression following arterial injury is revealed through numerousstudies of the epigenetic regulator, Klf4. Several publications bythe Owens group have demonstrated that Klf4 is up-regulated byPDGF-BB and plays a pivotal role in phenotypic transformationsof SMCs [39,40]. These studies are especially interesting in thatKlf4 is one of the four \u2018\u2018Yamanaka factors\u2019\u2019 that are capable of re-programming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.The role of Klf4 in SMC de-differentiation, however, is stillsomewhat unclear. Other studies have shown that Klf4 has aninhibitory effect on SMC proliferation [41]. The discrepant role ofKlf4 in SMC differentiation/de-differentiation is discussed in arecent review where it is suggested that post-translationalmodifications of this protein might explain its variable function[42]. Regardless, the stem cell marker Klf4 appears to play animportant, but somewhat controversial, role in SMC differentia-tion, proliferation, and vascular restenosis.PDGF-BB is by far the most widely studied stimulant of de-differentiation and numerous investigators have dissected themolecular mechanisms through which this protein inducesphenotypic switching of SMCs. PDGF-BB has been shown toactivate the MAPK signaling cascade leading to Elk-1 phosphor-ylation [43]. Myocardin is a master regulator for differentiationand contractile protein expression in SMCs [46]. PhosphorylatedElk-1 displaces myocardin at the promoter of SMC contractilegenes and reduces its expression [44]. IL-1b has also been shownin numerous studies to push cells towards a de-differentiated stateby inhibiting myocardin. This effect is mediated through NF-kBand Notch3 [45]. These findings demonstrate that there issignificant cross-talk between signaling proteins, suggesting thatSMC phenotypic switching is a highly dynamic process thatinvolves multiple pathways.The role of TGF-b in SMC differentiation is controversial andappears to depend upon the cell-type and developmental stage. Invitro, TGF-b has been found to stimulate SMC differentiation asevidenced by enhanced contractile protein expression. Chen et al.showed that TGF-b signaling promotes contractile proteinexpression in neural crest (Monc-1) cells which leads to theirdifferentiation into SMCs [24]. Imamura et al. showed that TGF-bhas the capacity to induce differentiation of bone marrow derivedprogenitor cells toward a SMC lineage through myocardin.Alternatively, our data suggest that TGF-b and Smad3 promotede-differentiation of adult SMCs, at least partially by reactivatingexpression of genes related to embryonic development andsuppressing expression of SMC differentiation markers. Thus inthe presence of elevated Smad3, TGF-b switches from a stimulantof differentiation to a promoter of de-differentiation.It has been previously discovered that in some cells, TGF-bpositively regulates stem cell function. For example, TGF-bsignaling is necessary for proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells[47]. Moreover, the TGF-b family has been implicated in themaintenance of embryonic stem cells [48], preventing these cellsfrom differentiating and migrating. Falk et al. reported that TGF-bregulates neuronal stem cell proliferation through Wnt signaling[49]. Coincidentally, we found that TGF-b/Smad3 stimulate Wnt,Sox, and FGF family gene expression (Table 2). It appears thatelevated Smad3 is crucial for TGF-b regulated de-differentiation.Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3 have beenobserved in stem cells and both are decreased when stem cellsdifferentiate [50], suggesting that activated TGF-b signaling isrequired to maintain de-differentiation. TGF-b regulates embry-onic stem cell function by clustering Smad3 with other keyregulators including Nanog and Oct4 [51,52]. Together, Nanogand Oct4, along with Lin28 and Sox2, can induce differentiatedcells into pluripotent stem cells with full capacity to differentiateinto any cell type [53].Our findings demonstrate that reactivation of embryonicdevelopmental genes by TGF-b/Smad3 in a similar manner,leads to SMC plasticity and its consequences including SMCproliferation. Our qRT-PCR data confirm the microarray resultsand support a positive role for TGF-b/Smad3 in regulatingexpression of stem cell-related genes and SMC de-differentiation.It is interesting to note that CXCR4 and CD34, which are stemcell/progenitor markers, are substantially up-regulated in SMCsfollowing treatment with TGF-b/Smad3. Furthermore, we foundthat FGF-1, a potent mitogen for hematopoietic stem cellexpansion, was significantly up-regulated following TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation. In contrast to FGF-1, basic fibroblast growthfactor (FGF-2) is widely studied in SMCs and is known to enhanceproliferation, migration, and drive intimal hyperplasia. Althoughthere is a paucity of research regarding FGF-1 in SMCs, a reportby Takahashi et al. demonstrated that FGF-1 expression wassufficient to inhibit the differentiation of SMCs from progenitor-like cells [54]. CD34 and CXCR4 have also been studied in thevascular system. CD34 is a well-known marker for hematopoieticstem cells and is often found in endothelial cells [55]. However,our finding of CD34 in SMCs is novel. Several reports have shownthat the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis is important in the development ofintimal hyperplasia [56]. Nevertheless, the finding of CXCR4 inSMCs is also relatively novel. In contrast to stem/progenitormarkers, SMA, calponin and MHC, signature markers of SMCdifferentiation, are all down-regulated in SMCs in response to thetreatment with TGF-b/Smad3. A decrease of these SMC markersFigure 3. Up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of FGF-1, NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs by AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment.

Thus, it is reasonableto postulate that TGF-b in the presence of elevated Smad3 triggersFigure 4. Up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of CD34 and CXCR4 in SMCs by AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment.

While the functions of these twogenes in SMCs are not currently known, they have been reportedto play a role in differentiation of non-SMC cell types [57,58], notsupporting the hypothesis that TGF-b/Smad3 promotes de-differentiation. However, many developmental genes play differingor even opposite roles depending upon the context or the cell type.It may well be that NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs promote de-differentiation. Alternatively, it might be that TGF-b/Smad3induce transcription of genes associated with differentiation (NGFand Wnt11) as well as de-differentiation, but the balance of theircombined effect favors de-differentiation. It is also interesting tonote that TGF-b/Smad3 significantly increased (by ,5\u201310 foldcompared to AdGFP control) the expression of osteopontin, nestin,and collagen type II, which are markers of osteoblasts, neurocrestcells, and chondrocytes, respectively (Figure S3 in File S1).Moreover, TGF-b/Smad3-conditioned media were able to up-regulate osteopontin and nestin as well (Figure S4 in File S1). Up-regulation of these genes of different lineages lends additionalevidence to our assessment that TGF-b/Smad3-stimulated cellsFigure 5.

It is reasonable topostulate that de-differentiated cells have a greater potential thandifferentiated SMCs to express marker genes of other cell types.Taken together, the foregoing results prompt us to propose thatenhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling confers on SMCs the propen-sity to de-differentiate toward an earlier stage in the developmentallineage, which is consistent with our earlier observations thatTGF-b/Smad3 promotes SMC proliferation and migration andintimal hyperplasia.Our primary hypothesis is that SMCs that contribute to intimalhyperplasia are initially differentiated but transform into a de-differentiated state in response to factors such as TGF-b/Smad3.Alternative hypotheses have been proposed that might explain thepresence of de-differentiated cells in arterial media and subintimalplaque. One possibility is that these de-differentiated cellstranslocate from another site. For example, there is substantialevidence that at least some cells that contribute to the neointimaare myofibroblasts derived from the arterial adventitia [59]. Thereare a series of studies showing in the murine model, that neo-intimal cells are, in part, derived from the bone marrow[7,60,61,62]. A recent study raised the controversial notion thatde-differentiation of mature SMCs is not the primary driving forcebehind the development of intimal hyperplasia [3]. Rather,neointima develops from undifferentiated multipotent vascularstem cells (MVSCs) that naturally reside in the media of thenormal uninjured artery and then become activated with vascularinjury [3]. Although this notion is highly contentious, our findingsare not at complete odds with this theory. In studies of animal aswell as human plaque, we have found that some but far from allcells, have enhanced expression of Smad3 [63]. Possibly up-regulation of Smad3 signaling is confined to MVSCs followingvascular injury. Although the classical concept that quiescentmedial SMCs transform into the cells that comprise subintimalplaque is still well accepted, the contribution of de-differentiatedcells derived from other sources including the adventitia, bonemarrow, or an intrinsic population of stem cells within the normalarterial wall requires further exploration.TGF-b/Smad3 play an important role in the development ofvascular restenosis following arterial reconstruction. Our findingssuggest an important role for TGF-b/Smad3 in de-differentiationof vascular SMCs placing the TGF-b/Smad3 signaling axis at thecenter of a novel pathway that drives a phenotypic switch ofvascular SMCs following arterial injury. We have identified agroup of novel TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes that may be centralto this process. Blocking de-differentiation is a strategy that mightbe used to prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia. Thus, athorough understanding of the de-differentiation factors that areenhanced or the differentiation factors that are suppressed couldlead to novel therapeutics to prevent restenotic disease. Anapproach that includes simultaneous suppression or accentuationof several of these factors might be particularly strategic. Theidentification of global targets and molecular pathways associatedwith TGF-b/Smad3 pathway will provide a better understandingof the multi-faceted roles of TGF-b in complex pathophysiologicalprocesses of restenosis.Supporting InformationTable S1 The entire data set of microarray.(XLSX)File S1 Supporting Information Figures.
