We hypothesizedthat this susceptibility may be associated with a decreased response by leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).In this study, we compared LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd) by mononuclearcells (MNC) from adult peripheral blood and newborn umbilical cord blood in vitro and attempted todetermine the mechanisms involved in its regulation. At a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) and in thepresence of autologous plasma, MNC from adults and newborns secreted similar amounts of TNF-\ufffd. However,in the absence of plasma, MNC from newborns secreted significantly less TNF-\ufffd compared to MNC fromadults. Moreover, at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) and in the presence of plasma, TNF-\ufffd secretionwas significantly lower for newborn MNC compared to adult MNC. Adults and newborns had similar numbersof CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-positive cells as measured by flow cytometry. However, the intensityof the CD14 marker was greater for adult than for newborn cells. Incubation of cells with LPS led to an increasein CD14 and TLR-4 intensity for adult cells but not for newborn cells. The effect of LPS stimulation of adultor newborn cells was similar for ERK, p38, and I\ufffdB\ufffd phosphorylation, as well as I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. Finally,we assessed levels of the TLR-4 adapter protein, the myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88). We found adirect relation between adult and newborn TNF-\ufffd secretion and MyD88, which was significantly decreased innewborn monocytes. Since TLR-4 signals intracellularly through the adapter protein, MyD88, we hypothesizethat MyD88-dependent factors are responsible for delayed and decreased TNF-\ufffd secretion in newbornmonocytes.Phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils(PMNs) and monocytes play a key role in host defense againstbacterial infection. During infection, phagocytic cell activity ismodulated by cytokines (from the host) and toxins (from theinvading microorganism). For example, after exposure to lipo-polysaccharide (LPS), PMNs are primed for increased oxida-tive radical production (1, 45), and monocytes are activated toproduce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd) (4, 35). Sincepriming of PMNs and activation of monocytes are key stages ofthe early response to infection, any altered or delayed responseto LPS may interupt the host\u2019s response to infection.We have shown previously that PMNs from newborns areprimed less effectively in vitro with LPS compared to PMNsfrom adults (7, 38). Similarly, some authors have found thatmonocytes from newborns have a lower response than adultmonocytes in the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF-\ufffd, afterLPS stimulation (11, 36). This diminished response to LPS bynewborn monocytes and PMNs may contribute to the observedincreased incidence and susceptibility of newborns to gram-negative bacterial infection (22, 42).Over the past decade the mechanism of LPS interaction withthe phagocytic cell membrane has become more clearly under-stood. For adult PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages, CD14 isthe principal cell membrane receptor for the LPS/LPS-bindingprotein (LBP) complex (40). Indeed, the presence of CD14and LBP greatly enhance cellular activation with LPS (25, 27,37, 41, 48, 50, 51, 54). In addition to CD14, a family of trans-membrane receptors with homology to Toll proteins of Dro-sophila are known to trigger inflammatory reactions, includingsecretion of proinflammatory cytokines (32, 39). The Toll-likereceptor-4 (TLR-4) imparts ligand-specific recognition of LPSfor mammalian cells (18, 28). Through CD14\u2013TLR-4 interac-tions, LPS induces several intracellular responses, includingactivation of nuclear factor \ufffdB (NF-\ufffdB) and activation of themitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, particularlyextracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 (49).However, the intracellular processes involved in TNF-\ufffd tran-scription, translation, and secretion into the extracellular spaceafter stimulation by LPS are less well understood.Using an in vitro model of the mononuclear cell (MNC)response to LPS, Cohen et al. (11) showed that cells derivedfrom cord blood of newborns secrete lower amounts of TNF-\ufffdcompared to MNC from adults. A decreased response to LPSmay be even more marked in preterm infants (17, 24). How-ever, the mechanism underlying the hyporesponsiveness ofnewborn cells has not been determined. We hypothesized thatnewborn cells have an inherent deficiency in the production of* Corresponding author.

We investigated surface expres-sion of CD14 and TLR-4 on adult and newborn monocytes andLPS-induced TNF-\ufffd secretion. We also compared intracellularfactors in adult and newborn mononuclear cells, including my-eloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylationof ERK-1 and ERK-2 (ERK-1/2) and p38, as well as I\ufffdB phos-phorylation and degradation. We report here that diminishedLPS-induced TNF-\ufffd protein secretion by monocytes from humannewborns is associated with diminished MyD88 expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents.

Fresh peripheral venous blood from healthy adult volun-teers and umbilical cord blood from normal, full-term newborns delivered bycaesarean section, were collected aseptically and anticoagulated with heparin (10U/ml). MNC were isolated by using a Percoll gradient technique describedpreviously (34). MNC were routinely purified to \ufffd95% purity and \ufffd98% via-bility in approximately 2 h and were assayed immediately afterward. After en-richment, MNC were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 without serum. Inpreliminary experiments, MNC from adult venous and from newborn cord bloodwere characterized by using flow cytometry (FACS) for surface CD14. Thepercentage of CD14 positive monocytes in MNC was similar for adult andnewborn cells (10 and 12%, respectively).Adherent cells (monocytes) were prepared by culturing MNC (3.5 \ufffd 106/ml)in RPMI 1640 with 5% autologous plasma in the wells of a 24-well plate at 37\u00b0Cand 5% CO2 for 2 h. The nonadherent cells were removed by a wash withmedium without plasma. Adherent cells were stimulated with LPS (at concen-trations indicated in Results) in RPMI 1640 culture medium with or without 5%autologous plasma. Supernatants of adherent cells were collected at 1, 3, 6, and24 h and stored at \t70\u00b0C until assayed. In some experiments, MNC were alsocultured and stimulated with LPS in suspension (i.e., nonadherent).Flow cytometry. For CD14 assessment healthy adult venous or full term new-born cord blood (50 l) samples were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1or 10 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C before being stained with anti-CD14 (MY4clone; final concentration, 12.5 g/ml) or isotype control antibody (12.5 g/ml)for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks balanced saltsolution and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at4\u00b0C, and then 1 ml of red blood cell lysing solution was added. The cells were washedthen fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).For TLR-4 staining, leukocyte-rich plasma was incubated in the presence orabsence of 5 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed twice with PBSand labeled with a mouse anti-human TLR-4 (IgG2a) MAb or IgG2a isotypecontrol antibody for 1 h and then washed and incubated with FITC-conjugatedgoat anti-mouse IgG. Red blood cells were then removed by hypotonic washing,and the remaining cells were suspended in 1% paraformaldehyde. Cell prepa-rations were stored at 4\u00b0C until FACS analysis. Cells were analyzed by using aBecton Dickinson FACScan by using the Lysis II software program. Lympho-cytes, PMNs, and monocytes were identified on the basis of front and side lightscatter. Specific CD14 and TLR-4 was expressed as the mean value of thefluorescence intensity on samples minus that of the isotype control.Measurements of adult and newborn TNF-\ufffd. Bioactivity of TNF-\ufffd was as-sessed with L929 cells as described previously (19). TNF-\ufffd protein concentra-tions were measured by using an ELISA as described by the manufacturer(Pharmingen) by using MAb 1 (2 g/ml) as capture and biotin-conjugated MAb11 for detection. TNF-\ufffd standards and adult and newborn MNC supernatantswere diluted in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. The lower limit of detectionwas 15 pg/ml in the assay. For intracellular TNF-\ufffd, standards were diluted in lysisbuffer. The lower limit of detection with lysis buffer was 30 pg/106 cells.Measurements of adult and neonate mRNA for TNF-\ufffd. Isolation of total adultand newborn cellular RNA was achieved by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. One microgram each of adult andnewborn MNC RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by using Superscript IIreverse transcriptase in the presence of [\ufffd-32P]dCTP. Then, equal amounts ofacid-precipitable counts per minute of each cDNA were used for PCR. PCR wasrun for 35 cycles for \ufffd-actin detection and 40 or 45 cycles for TNF-\ufffd detectionin the presence of specific primer. The sequences for the sense and antisenseprimers for TNF-\ufffd are 5\ufffd-TTG TTC CTC AGC CTC TTC TCC-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-AGGGTT TGC TAC AAC ATG GGC-3\ufffd, respectively, and the sense and antisenseprimer for \ufffd-actin are 5\ufffd-ACA TCC GCA AAG ACC TGT ACG-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TTGCTG ATC CAC ATC TGC TGG-3\ufffd, respectively. The antisense primer forTNF-\ufffd spans an intron-exon boundary and thus cannot amplify a product fromDNA. Neither TNF-\ufffd primer cross-reacts with human TNF-\ufffd. PCR productswere electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.5 g of ethidiumbromide/ml and photographed under UV light.Western blot assays. Adherent monocytes from adults and newborns wereprepared and incubated in the absence or presence of LPS (0.1 or 10 ng/ml) asdescribed above for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After the incubation, themedium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS con-taining 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The PBS was then replaced with 0.5ml of M2 buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaC1, 3 mM EGTA,3 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 g ofleupeptin/ml, 5 g/ml of pepstatin A, 10 g of aprotinin/ml, 0.1 mM Na3VO4).After incubation for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the lysates were transferred to microcentri-fuge tubes and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C toremove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations in the lysates were de-termined by using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Twenty micrograms ofprotein from each sample was analyzed by Western blotting after sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer, with antibodiesspecific for phosphorylated I\ufffdB\ufffd, I\ufffdB\ufffd protein, MyD88, TLR-4, phosphorylatedp38, or ERK1/2. The binding of the antibodies were detected with HRP-conju-gated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG and ECL Western blotting reagents, fol-lowed by exposure to Kodak X-ray films. The equality of loading was confirmedby stripping the membranes and reblotting with p38, ERK2 protein antibodies asdescribed earlier (6). Band density was quantified by densitometry analysis byusing NIH Image J software and calculated as the corrected density of MyD88bands related to that of \ufffd-actin on the same blots.Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean \ufffd the standard deviation(SD) (see Fig. 1, 3, and 5) or the mean \ufffd standard error of mean (SEM) (see Fig.2). For comparison between adult and newborn samples, a nonpaired t test wasused; a P value of \ufffd0.05 was considered significant. Statistical determinationswere done by using Statistix (Analytical Software, Minneapolis, Minn.).RESULTSTNF-\ufffd secretion by adult and newborn MNC. TNF-\ufffd secre-tion from adherent monocytes of adults and newborns was1224 YAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.compared by using bioassay and ELISA. In agreement withearlier reports that newborn monocytes secret fewer cytokinesthan adult monocytes upon LPS stimulation (11, 36), in ourexperimental system, we also observed that the secretion ofTNF-\ufffd from both adherent monocytes and nonadherent MNCof newborns was less than that from adults early in incubation(\ufffd6 h) (Fig. 1). For adult cells the concentration of TNF-\ufffd inthe supernatant of adherent monocytes peaked between 3 and6 h, whereas the maximum for newborn cells was not reacheduntil 6 h of incubation. Excellent correlation between bioassayand ELISA was found for cells from adults and newborns (Fig.1A and B) (r \ufffd 0.94).Since adherence of monocytes to glass or plastic may signalcells to produce inflammatory cytokines (26) and to developcharacteristics of tissue macrophages, we undertook experi-ments with nonadherent MNC in the presence or absence ofplasma. Using this model we compared LPS-induced TNF-\ufffdproduction by adult venous and newborn cord blood MNC. Asshown in Fig. 1C, neither adult nor newborn MNC secreteddetectable TNF-\ufffd protein (\ufffd15 pg/ml) after stimulation with alow concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) in the absence of plasma.In the presence of plasma (5%), however, this low concentra-tion of LPS did induce both adult and newborn MNC TNF-\ufffdsecretion. Levels achieved by adult MNC were significantlyhigher than that of newborn cells at 3 h (5.38 \ufffd 0.56 ng/mlversus 0.97 \ufffd 0.85 ng/ml; P \ufffd 0.01). The difference betweenadult and newborn cellular response was still seen after 6 h ofincubation (6.60 \ufffd 0.97 ng/ml versus 1.52 \ufffd 1.30 ng/ml; P \ufffd0.05).In the absence of plasma and at a higher LPS concentration(10 ng/ml), both adult and newborn MNC produced TNF-\ufffd(Fig. 1C), but MNC from newborns again secreted less TNF-\ufffdcompared to adult MNC (0.72 \ufffd 0.33 ng/ml versus 2.05 \ufffd 0.72ng/ml; P \ufffd 0.05). As expected, when 5% plasma was present,MNC from both adults and newborns secreted higher amountsof TNF-\ufffd. Under these conditions (10 ng of LPS/ml plus 5%plasma) adult and newborn MNC secreted similar amounts ofTNF-\ufffd (5.80 \ufffd 1.01 ng/ml for adult and 5.65 \ufffd 0.57 ng/ml fornewborn MNC).In order to better understand TNF-\ufffd regulation in new-borns, we examined the levels of mRNA for TNF-\ufffd in stimu-lated MNC. Newborn and adult MNC consistently showeddetectable mRNA for TNF-\ufffd in the presence of 0.1 ng ofLPS/ml alone, although we failed to detect secreted or intra-cellular TNF-\ufffd protein under this condition. When plasma andLPS (0.1 ng/ml) were both present in the cultures, steady-statemRNA levels slightly increased but remained similar in bothadult and newborn cells (Fig. 2). Thus, differences in TNF-\ufffdexpression could not be attributed to major differences inTNF-\ufffd mRNA levels between adults and newborns.CD14 and TLR-4 of adult and newborn monocytes. Sincemembrane-bound CD14 and TLR-4 is required for effectiveLPS induced TNF-\ufffd production from monocytes/macro-phages, we characterized CD14 on monocytes from adults andFIG. 1. Plastic adherent newborn monocytes and MNC produceless TNF-\ufffd than adult monocytes.

(C) MNC were incubatedfor 3 h with LPS (at 0.1 and 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence ofadult plasma (5%).

TNF-\ufffd mRNA levels are similar in MNC from adults andnewborns. Adult and newborn monocytes were incubated with LPS(0.1 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of adult plasma (5%) for 3 h.Total cellular RNA was extracted and used in reverse transcription-PCR with specific primer sets for TNF-\ufffd and \ufffd-actin. A representativeresult of three independent experiments is shown.VOL. 72, 2004 TNF-\ufffd PRODUCTION BY NEWBORN MONONUCLEAR CELLS 1225newborns before or after LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3,adult and newborn monocytes expressed similar levels ofTLR-4 and CD14 before LPS stimulation; however, newborncells demonstrated significantly lower levels of both TLR-4 andCD14 than adult cells after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3).Responses of MAP kinases and I\ufffdB\ufffd in monocytes fromadults and newborns to LPS stimulation. The inducible ex-pression of the gene for TNF-\ufffd by monocytes is regulated byMAP kinases and I\ufffdB/NF-\ufffdB nuclear transcription factors (14,49). Because the LPS-induced secretion of TNF-\ufffd from new-born MNC was remarkably decreased compared to adult cells,we assessed the signaling molecule activation in adult andnewborn monocytes after LPS stimulation. The basal levels ofphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in newborn monocyteswere slightly higher than in adult monocytes (Fig. 4A and C).After LPS stimulation, incremental changes in levels of phos-phorylated ERK1/2 were somewhat greater in adult than new-born monocytes (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, LPS activatedp38 to a similar extent in monocytes from both adults andnewborns (Fig. 4C). Similar results were observed in MNC thatwere incubated in suspension (Fig. 5). These patterns of MAPkinase responsiveness suggest that MAP kinase signaling, byitself, was unlikely to be responsible for the attenuation ofnewborn TNF-\ufffd production.A critical step during induction of many cytokines is theactivation of NF-\ufffdB. This occurs as a result of phosphorylationFIG. 3. LPS-stimulated newborn monocytes have lower amounts ofTLR-4 and CD14 than adult cells.

As shown inFig. 4E and F, I\ufffdB\ufffd phosphorylation and I\ufffdB\ufffd protein deg-radation were similar for both adult and newborn monocytes.These data correspond with the reverse transcription-PCR re-sults showing similar levels of TNF-\ufffd mRNA in adult andnewborn cells (Fig. 2).Expression of MyD88 in monocytes from adults and new-borns. MyD88, a cytosolic adapter protein, has been reportedas an essential mediator for LPS receptor signaling (3, 21, 43,46). Thus, we investigated whether there was any difference inthe expression of MyD88 in adult versus newborn monocytesby using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, there was amarked difference in protein levels of MyD88 in lysates pre-pared from newborn compared to adult monocytes (58.7% \ufffd9.8% of adult monocyte MyD88 protein; P \ufffd 0.0003 as deter-mined by paired t test). This was not linked to any detectabledifference in total cellular TLR-4 protein on the same analyzedsamples (Fig. 6), although the surface expression of this recep-tor was higher in LPS-stimulated adult cells compared to new-born cells (Fig. 3A).DISCUSSIONIt is generally understood that newborns have increasedsusceptibility to gram-negative bacterial and viral infection. Anumber of mechanisms may contribute to this, including hu-moral and cellular factors. In recent years cytokines critical inthe early stages of inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)(36) and IL-12 (20, 31), have also been assessed in newborns.Most of this work was done with primary cell cultures stimu-lated in vitro with live organisms or bacterial LPS. Diminishedand delayed secretion of these cytokines has been reported fornewborn cells.The results of studies comparing TNF-\ufffd secretion by new-born animals or cells after stimulation with LPS or bacteriahave been variable. Although most studies have reported di-minished responsiveness of newborns (9, 11, 36), some inves-tigations have found similar or increased responsiveness ofnewborns compared to juvenile or adult animals after LPSstimulation (13).In our study, significantly lower amounts of TNF-\ufffd weresecreted by human newborn MNC compared to adult MNCafter LPS exposure. This was evident when cells were stimu-lated with a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) in the ab-sence of plasma and at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml)in the presence of plasma.Diminished TNF-\ufffd secretion correlated directly with levelsof MyD88 in newborn cells. Our findings with MNC and ourprevious report with PMNs from normal newborns (38) areremarkably similar to observations with cells from MyD88\t/\tmice and MyD88 truncated cells. Mice with the MyD88 geneinactivated (MyD88\t/\t) lack LPS-induced cytokine produc-tion and NO2\t release but preserve NF-\ufffdB and JNK activation(2, 21, 23). TLR signaling is also suppressed when MyD88molecule is truncated (10). The diminished LPS responses thatwe observed in newborn MNC are therefore consistent withFIG. 6. Expression of MyD88 and TLR-4 in adult and newborn monocytes. (A) Adherent monocytes were harvested and lysed as described inthe text. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-MyD88 antibody. (B and C) The same membranes were stripped andreblotted with a rabbit anti-TLR-4 antibody (B) and then repeatedly with the stripping-reblotting cycle for \ufffd-actin (C). A pooled result of thedensitometry analysis of MyD88 bands in panel A is shown in panel D as means \ufffd the SD of arbitrary units normalized by the density of \ufffd-actinbands (n \ufffd 7). \u274b, P \ufffd 0.0003 (paired t test).VOL. 72, 2004 TNF-\ufffd PRODUCTION BY NEWBORN MONONUCLEAR CELLS 1227reports of decreased expression of MyD88. Because of its cen-tral place in signaling pathways, MyD88 may become a \u201cbot-tleneck\u201d affecting TLR-triggered cytokines in general (44).This possibility should be explored through assessment ofother stimuli linked to MyD88 processing and other cytokines.The differences between newborn and adult TNF-\ufffd secre-tion are most evident in suboptimal conditions of stimulation,such as low concentrations of LPS in the presence of plasma orhigher concentrations of LPS in the absence of plasma. How-ever, with high concentrations of LPS in the presence ofplasma, newborn and adult MNC secrete similar amounts ofTNF-\ufffd. The reason for this difference is currently not clear.We hypothesize that, at high concentrations, LPS may over-whelm deficits of MyD88 by signaling through a MyD88-inde-pendent pathway, resulting in similar amounts of TNF-\ufffd se-cretion in adult and newborn MNC.Production and secretion of TNF-\ufffd may be controlled ormodulated at several steps: cell receptors, intracellular mes-sengers, mRNA transcription, protein translation, intracellularstorage, and/or secretion. In addition, LPS can interact withcells via at least two pathways that are either dependent orindependent of plasma proteins (5, 11, 12, 30, 47, 52, 53). Thetwo pathways of LPS activation may serve different roles ingram-negative bacterial infection. Plasma-dependent LPS ac-tivation may be the predominant pathway for monocytes andPMNs in the bloodstream, where plasma proteins are at highconcentrations and LPS levels are low early in sepsis. In con-trast, the plasma-independent pathway may be important atthe local site of infection, where plasma proteins levels are lowand the LPS concentration may be high. Understanding bothpathways of cellular activation by LPS will be important inorder to understand the host response to gram-negative infec-tion.At low concentrations of LPS, LBP facilitates the binding ofLPS to CD14 and greatly enhances TNF-\ufffd secretion. Thus,one possible explanation for our finding is that LBP or someother constituents of plasma may be more active in adult thanin newborn plasma. However, LBP is unlikely to be responsi-ble, since we have shown previously that concentrations innewborn and adult plasma are similar (8). We also speculatedthat the difference between adult and newborn MNC proteinproduction might be related to mRNA transcription. However,when mRNA for TNF-\ufffd was assessed, no striking differencewas observed. This observation is consistent with the report ofHan et al. (16) showing that TNF-\ufffd secretion after LPS stim-ulation is controlled primarily by posttranscriptional mecha-nisms.CD14 is a critical LPS receptor on human MNC. Most LPSresponses including activation of MAP kinases depend primar-ily on CD14 (15, 29). Because CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidy-linositol-anchoring molecule, it lacks an intracellular domainneeded to transmit the LPS signal. As presently understood,LPS, with the extracellular proteins LBP and MD2, binds toCD14, which then clusters with TLR-4. The CD14\u2013TLR-4complex then signals intracellularly through the adapter pro-teins MyD88 and/or Mal (MyD88 adapter-like protein) to in-duce activation of IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase),which triggers signal cascades through MAP kinase and otherpathways (3, 21, 33, 43, 46). We found that TLR-4 expressionin the monocytes of adults and newborns is similar before cellsare stimulated with LPS. The MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38were phosphorylated in both adult and newborn monocytes inresponse to LPS. However, more studies should be done onMAP kinases to determine whether subtle differences betweenadults and newborns are present. The LPS induced I\ufffdB\ufffd phos-phorylation and degradation were also similar in adult andnewborn monocytes.The finding of greatly diminished MyD88 in cells of humannewborns provides some insight into the role this moleculemay play in the diminished inflammatory responses in new-borns. Although the suppression of inflammation and acquiredimmunity may be advantageous for survival of the fetus, innateand acquired immune processes must be acquired rapidly afterbirth. Further study on regulation of MyD88 should be done toprovide insight into the ontogeny of the innate immune system.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Chris Waterhouse and Linda Best for their technicalassistance, Kim Barrett for transcribing the manuscript, and the CaseRoom nurses of the IWK Health Centre for their assistance in collect-ing newborn umbilical cord blood.This research was supported by Hospital for Sick Children Founda-tion (Toronto) and the Canada Institute of Health Research(MT14439).
