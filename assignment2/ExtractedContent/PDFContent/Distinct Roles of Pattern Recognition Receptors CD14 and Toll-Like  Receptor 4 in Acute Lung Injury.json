Scott Worthen1,2Division of Respiratory Infections, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Medical and Research Center,1 and Divisionof Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences,2 Denver, Colorado,and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts3Received 5 October 2004/Accepted 16 November 2004Acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major cause of mortality among humans.ALI is characterized by microvascular protein leakage, neutrophil influx, and expression of proinflammatorymediators, followed by severe lung damage. LPS binding to its receptors is the crucial step in the causation ofthese multistep events. LPS binding and signaling involves CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, therelative contributions of CD14 and TLR4 in the induction of ALI and their therapeutic potentials are not clearin vivo. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the roles of CD14 and TLR4 in LPS-inducedALI to determine which of these molecules is the more critical target for attenuating ALI in a mouse model.Our results show that CD14 and TLR4 are necessary for low-dose (300-\ufffdg/ml) LPS-induced microvascularleakage, NF-\ufffdB activation, neutrophil influx, cytokine and chemokine (KC, macrophage inflammatory protein2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6) expression, and subsequent lung damage. On the other hand,when a 10-fold-higher dose of LPS (3 mg/ml) was used, these responses were only partially dependent on CD14and they were totally dependent on TLR4. The CD14-independent LPS response was dependent on CD11b. ATLR4 blocking antibody abolished microvascular leakage, neutrophil accumulation, cytokine responses, andlung pathology with a low dose of LPS but only attenuated the responses with a high dose of LPS. These dataare the first to demonstrate that LPS-induced CD14-depdendent and -independent (CD11b-dependent) sig-naling pathways in the lung are entirely dependent on TLR4 and that blocking TLR4 might be beneficial inlung diseases caused by LPS from gram-negative pathogens.Pulmonary inflammation leading to acute lung injury (ALI)or its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), is a leading cause of mortality among humans (5, 28).ALI is characterized by extensive neutrophil influx into thelungs, production of proinflammatory mediators, and damageof lung epithelial and endothelial surfaces (12, 33, 38). Pulmo-nary inflammation resulting in ALI may be a harbinger ofmultiple organ failure, particularly during sepsis associatedwith increased circulatory levels of endotoxin or lipopolysac-charide (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria. Hence,LPS has been recognized as a principal component in thecausation of ALI (7). LPS recognition by the host receptors isthe critical first step in a multistep sequence leading to activa-tion of a plethora of signal transduction cascades in a variety ofcells present in the lung. The downstream effectors of theseLPS-induced signaling pathways then induce the production ofa variety of endogenous mediators, including proinflammatorycytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules, reactive oxy-gen species, and nitric oxide, by various lung cells (8, 21, 31),leading to ALI or ARDS.LPS recognition is mediated, in part, by CD14 (30, 39).CD14 is expressed as a 55-kDa protein in two forms; a solubleform (sCD14) is found in serum, while a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-linked membrane-bound form (mCD14) is found pre-dominantly in phagocytes. Neither of these forms has intrinsicsignaling properties because of the lack of a transmembranedomain (30). Although mCD14 requires Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4), sCD14 requires both LPS-binding protein (LBP) andTLR4 to induce downstream signaling cascades (10). It iswidely believed that mCD14 transfers LPS to its high-affinityreceptor, TLR4 (9, 14). It has also been demonstrated thatboth CD14-dependent and -independent signaling cascadesare responsible for cellular responses in thioglycolate-elicitedperitoneal macrophages in response to Escherichia coli LPS(27). A subsequent study showed that CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) isan important molecule, in addition to CD14 and TLR4, ineliciting a complete LPS response in thioglycolate-elicitedperitoneal macrophages (26). However, it has not been deter-mined whether CD11b is responsible for the CD14-indepen-dent but TLR4-dependent pathway of LPS signaling in vivo.Furthermore, the exact contribution of CD14-dependent and-independent pathways to the multiple signaling pathways re-sulting in lung injury induced by LPS is unknown.A large body of evidence has demonstrated that TLR4 isrequired for induction of an innate immune response againstLPS from gram-negative bacteria (14, 29). This conclusion issupported by the fact that mice having a gene disruption(TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd) (14), deletion (C57BL/10ScCr), or natural pointmutation (C3H/HeJ) in the TLR4 gene are unresponsive tosystemic LPS (29). However, the role of TLR4 in the inductionof pulmonary inflammation in mice is still debatable. A role ofTLR4 has been described in a murine model of hemorrhage\u2013LPS-induced lung inflammation (4). By contrast, another study* Corresponding author.

The goal of the present study was tocompare the roles of CD14 and TLR4 in the pathogenesis oflung damage induced after inhalation of E. coli LPS in order todetermine which of these molecules is the more critical targetfor attenuating lung damage in a mouse model. Since CD14and TLR4 are important for LPS recognition and signaling inthe host, we hypothesized that a deficiency in or mutation ofeither CD14 or TLR4 protects mice against pulmonary inflam-mation caused by LPS, but the relative efficacy of such hypoth-esized protection is not known.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice. CD14-null (CD14\ufffd/\ufffd) mice were used after they were backcrossed 10times with C57BL/6 mice as described previously (24). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice(CD14\ufffd/\ufffd; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind.) were used as controls forCD14\ufffd/\ufffd. TLR4 mutant mice (TLR4mt; C3H/HeJ) were purchased from Jack-son Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine); the mutation in these mice resulted inresistance to the pathophysiological effects of LPS, and these mice have no otherknown defects in responses to microbes and/or their products (29). Wild-typeC3H/HeN mice (TLR4wt; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were used as controls forTLR4mt mice. In another set of experiments, we used a CD14 TLR4 double-knockout strain that was created from CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4-deficient mice after10 backcrosses with C57BL/6 mice (14). All animal experiments were conductedin accordance with National Jewish Medical and Research Center committee-approved protocols based on Association for Assessment and Accreditation ofLaboratory Animal Care policies. The mice weighed between 20 and 30 g andwere between 8 and 10 weeks old at the time of use.Reagents. Purified E. coli O111:B4 LPS, sterile distilled water, hexadecyltri-methylammonium bromide (HTAB), and O-dianisidine were purchased fromSigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Anti-mouse CD11b and its isotype-matched control antibody (Ab), capture and blocking antibodies for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and cytokine standards were purchasedfrom R&D systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). Anti-TLR4 Ab and the isotype Abwere obtained from e-Biosciences (San Diego, Calif.). Isotonic saline (0.9%sodium chloride) was purchased from Baxter Corp. (Deerfield, Ill.).LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. The induction of pulmonary inflam-mation in a mouse model by LPS instillation has been described previously (17,25). Briefly, mice were exposed to 0.3 mg of LPS per ml in 0.9% saline or to 0.9%saline by aerosolization for 20 min under a laminar flow hood by using a flow rateof 2 liters/min. For high-dose LPS experiments, 3 mg of LPS per ml in 0.9%saline was used in a similar manner (17, 25). At 2, 8, and 24 h after inhalation ofLPS or 0.9% saline, mice were sacrificed for collection of bronchoalveolar lavageFIG. 1. Effect of E. coli LPS on protein contents, total white blood cell counts, and neutrophil counts in the BALF recovered from LPS- orsaline-instilled lungs at 2, 8, and 24 h for CD14\ufffd/\ufffd, TLR4mt, and wild-type (CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wt) mice.

A dose of Ab (sodium azide free) was dilutedin 40 \ufffdl of phosphate-buffered saline prior to intratracheal administration. Incontrol experiments, 40 \ufffdl of phosphate-buffered saline was administrated in-tratracheally.(i) Anti-CD11b Ab. The immunoglobulin G2B (IgG2B) clone M1/70 CD11bblocking Ab or the isotype control IgG2B Ab was administrated at a concentra-tion of 40 \ufffdg/mouse 2 h prior to LPS exposure. The mice were anesthetized byusing Avertin (333 mg/kg), and the Ab was slowly infused intratracheally into themouse lungs. It has been shown previously that the anti-CD11b Ab specificallyblocks mouse CD11b at this concentration in vivo (6).(ii) Anti-TLR4 Ab. Mice were pretreated with either an anti-TLR4 Ab thatrecognizes the extracellular domain of mouse TLR4 or the isotype-matchedcontrol Ab 2 h prior to LPS exposure. Previous studies have shown that thisanti-TLR4 Ab is indeed a blocking Ab that binds to TLR4 and blocks LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd) production in cultured macro-phages (2). We used a concentration of 20 \ufffdg/mouse based on its maximalinhibition of LPS-induced effects in vivo as determined with a range of Abconcentrations (2, 20, and 100 \ufffdg/mouse) (Jeyaseelan and Worthen, unpublisheddata). The mice were then exposed to LPS and were sacrificed at 8 and 24 h forthe collection of BALF and lungs.BALF collection. BALF was harvested as previously described (17, 25). Ap-proximately 3.0 ml of BALF was obtained from each mouse. One hundredmicroliters of BALF was centrifuged for 5 min at 400 \ufffd g by using a cytospin ona Superfrost/Plus microscopic slide, and BALF cells were stained by the Diff-Quick method (Fisher, Chicago, Ill.). The rest of the BALF was passed througha 0.22-\ufffdm-pore-size filter and then used immediately or stored at \ufffd70\u00b0C forprotein measurement of KC, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2),TNF-\ufffd, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents by ELISA, and the total protein con-centration in recovered BALF was determined by using the Bradford assay(Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.).Tissue collection. The animals were humanely sacrificed, and their lungs wereexcised. The whole lungs were then snap frozen and processed for NF-\ufffdBtranslocation and myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays.MPO assay. An MPO assay was performed as described previously (3, 17).After BALF was collected, isolated whole lungs were weighed, frozen at \ufffd70\u00b0C,and then homogenized in 1 ml of HTAB buffer for 30 s (50 mg of tissue/ml ofHTAB). After addition of more HTAB buffer (according to the weight of thelungs) to each tube, the samples were vortexed. After this, 1 ml of homogenatewas transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20,000 \ufffd g for 4min. Seven microliters of supernatant was transferred into a flat-bottom 96-wellplate, and 200 \ufffdl of a O-dianisidine hydrochloride solution was added immedi-ately before the optical density at 450 nm was determined. The MPO activity wasexpressed in units per milligram of lung tissue.Lung morphology. Mouse lungs were perfused and fixed with Streck tissuefixative (Streck Laboratories, Omaha, Nebr.) overnight at room temperature.The lungs were embedded in paraffin, and 5-\ufffdm sections were cut and stainedwith hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis.NF-\ufffdB activation assay. Nuclear extract from mouse lungs was prepared byusing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Active Motif, Carlsbad, Calif.). Briefly, frozenlung samples were homogenized with 300 \ufffdl of ice-cold 1\ufffd hypotonic buffersupplemented with dithiothreitol for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at850 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet (nuclearfraction) was resuspended in 50 \ufffdl of complete lysis buffer and incubated for 30min on ice. Then the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, andthe supernatant was collected and stored at \ufffd70\u00b0C. The protein concentrationsof the samples were assessed by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 20 \ufffdgof nuclear extract was used to measure the activity of the p65 subunit of NF-\ufffdBaccording to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Active Motif). The opticalFIG. 2.

These times were selected becausein our previous studies we found dramatic differences in thecharacteristic features of the inflammatory response to LPS(17). We first examined the microvascular leakage of proteinsinto lung parenchyma in response to LPS. In saline controls forall four groups of mice (C57BL/6 [CD14\ufffd/\ufffd], CD14\ufffd/\ufffd,C3HeN [TLR4wt], and C3HeJ [TLR4mt]), the total proteincontents in mice were not different at 2, 8, or 24 h (Fig. 1A andE). On the other hand, inhalation of LPS significantly in-creased the BALF total protein content in wild-type mice(CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wt) at 8 and 24 h (Fig. 1A and E), indi-cating that there was microvascular leakage induced by LPS atlater times in these mouse strains. By contrast, no increase inthe total protein content was observed in LPS-treated lungs ofCD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice at 8 and 24 h (Fig. 1A and E). Inorder to measure leukocyte accumulation in response to LPS,the total number of white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophilsin BALF and lung MPO activity, an index of neutrophil se-questration, were determined. Saline control data showed thatthere was no difference among the four groups (Fig. 1B to Dand F to H). On the other hand, LPS treatment of wild-typemice (CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wt) increased the total WBC andneutrophil counts in BALF and the lung MPO activity at 8 and24 h (Fig. 1B to D and F to H), indicating that neutrophilsaccumulated in both the alveolar space and the whole lung.However, no increase in the total WBC and neutrophil countsin BALF or in lung MPO activity was noted in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd andTLR4mt mice at either 8 or 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 1Bto D and F to H). We then assessed lung histology in responseto LPS at 24 h since we previously demonstrated that lungpathology in response to inhaled LPS is most evident at 24 h(17). In animals treated with saline, no lung pathology wasobserved in any of the four groups (Fig. 2 C to D and G to H).By contrast, LPS treatment induced interstitial edema andneutrophil influx in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wt mice at 24 h (Fig. 2Band F). No changes in lung histology were detected inCD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice at 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig.2A and B). These observations indicate that both CD14 andTLR4 are essential for the induction of microvascular damage,increase in the total WBC count, neutrophil influx, and lunghistology in response to 300 \ufffdg of LPS/ml.FIG. 5.

INFECT. IMMUN.NF-\ufffdB activation of CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice in responseto LPS. Previous studies have shown that LPS binding to itsreceptor(s) induces a signaling cascade that involves activationof NF-\ufffdB, which activates the transcription of a variety ofgenes involved in ALI (18). Therefore, we measured the trans-location of the p65 subunit of NF-\ufffdB into the nucleus of lungcells as an index of LPS signaling. LPS caused significant ac-tivation of NF-\ufffdB in the lungs from CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wtmice (Fig. 3), but no significant activation of NF-\ufffdB was ob-served in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice or saline-treatedCD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4wt mice (Fig. 3A). These observationsdemonstrated that CD14 and TLR4 are essential in LPS sig-naling cascades leading to NF-\ufffdB activation.Cytokine responses in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice in re-sponse to LPS. To understand the mechanisms involved in theCD14- and TLR4-dependent innate immune response in thelung in response to LPS, BALF was analyzed to determine theexpression of chemokine and cytokine proteins, including KC,MIP-2, TNF-\ufffd, and IL-6. Figure 4 shows that there were in-creased KC, MIP-2, TNF-\ufffd, and IL-6 levels in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd andTLR4wt mouse BALF after LPS treatment at 2, 8, and 24 h,respectively, compared to the saline-treated control mice. Incontrast, no increases in the levels of these cytokines wereobserved in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd mice (Fig. 4A to D) and TLR4mt mice(Fig. 5E to H) in response to LPS. These findings show thatLPS signaling via CD14 and TLR4 is necessary for induction ofexpression of these chemokines and cytokines.TLR4mt, TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd, and CD14/TLR4 double-knockout mice,but not CD14\ufffd/\ufffd mice, are completely resistant to high-doseLPS-induced ALI. In order to determine whether the lack of aresponse seen in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd and TLR4mt mice reflected a rela-tive blockade rather than an absolute blockade, we tested theresponse to a high dose of LPS (3 mg/ml). Furthermore, LPScaused significant microvascular protein leakage, an increasein the total WBC count, neutrophil influx into the lungs, andlung histopathology in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd mice at 24 h (Fig. 5A to D).However, no microvascular leakage, neutrophil influx, or lungpathology was observed in TLR4mt mice in response to thehigh dose of LPS at 24 h (Fig. 5E to H). In addition, thisCD14-independent response was not observed in TLR4-defi-cient mice, which had a C57BL/6 background, or in the CD14/TLR4 double-knockout mice, which also had a C57BL/6 back-ground (Fig. 5C, inset). Collectively, these data suggest thatboth CD14-dependent and -independent responses to LPS aretotally dependent on TLR4. We next determined the mecha-nisms underlying the CD14-independent signaling pathway us-ing a CD11b-blocking Ab, since it has been shown that CD11bis required for LPS-induced signaling in peritoneal macro-phages (15). Interestingly, LPS did not induce an increase inneutrophils (Fig. 6A) or in lung MPO activity (Fig. 6B) inanti-CD11b Ab-treated CD14\ufffd/\ufffd mice, indicating that CD11bis responsible for the CD14-independent pathway.Effects of TLR4-blocking Ab in LPS-induced ALI. SinceTLR4, unlike CD14, is critical for induction of ALI in mice inresponse to both low and high doses of LPS, we examinedwhether it is possible to modulate TLR4 signaling in order tominimize ALI caused by LPS in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Abblockade (20 \ufffdg/mouse) revealed that treatment of C57BL/6mice with Ab directed against TLR4 abrogated the neutrophilinflux, neutrophil sequestration in the lung, and lung pathologyinduced by a low dose of LPS, whereas treatment with theisotype-matched control Ab (IgG2\ufffd) (20 \ufffdg/mouse) did notinfluence LPS-induced ALI (Fig. 7). In a similar fashion, LPS-induced expression of KC, MIP-2, TNF-\ufffd, and IL-6 in BALFwas eliminated by anti-TLR4 Ab but not by the isotype-matched control Ab (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, anti-TLR4 Ababrogated LPS-induced histopathology at 24 h (Fig. 7). More-over, at the high dose of LPS, these responses were attenuatedonly by anti-TLR4 Ab (Fig. 8A to C, F, and G). However,anti-TLR4 or isotype-matched control Ab alone did not influ-ence lung histopathogy at 24 h after saline treatment (Fig. 8Dand E).DISCUSSIONInfection with gram-negative bacteria may lead to develop-ment of the sepsis syndrome as a consequence of an excessivehost response to LPS in humans (19, 23). One of the clinicalfeatures associated with sepsis in humans is pulmonary inflam-mation resulting in ALI or ARDS, which may also reflect apoorly controlled inflammatory response in the lungs in re-sponse to LPS (12, 33, 38). Despite recent advances, statisticshave shown that the mortality associated with ALI remainshigh among humans, warranting new treatment and preventionstrategies (28). LPS binding to CD14 and TLR4 is critical forinduction of a plethora of downstream effects leading to ALI.A thorough understanding of the role of these molecules thatrecognize LPS and induce its signaling cascades is critical fordesigning novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to at-tenuate ALI or ARDS. The present study was undertaken toFIG. 6.

In the absence of CD14, however, microvas-cular leakage, neutrophil influx and sequestration, and lunghistology with the high dose of LPS were only attenuated. Inanti-CD11b Ab-treated CD14\ufffd/\ufffd mice, no features of ALIwere observed with the high dose of LPS. Furthermore, noneof the features was present in TLR4mt mice with both low andhigh doses of LPS. Blockade of TLR4 with an Ab remarkablyattenuated LPS-induced microvascular protein leakage, neu-trophil influx, and lung histology with both the low and highdoses of LPS in normal C57BL/6 mice. These new findingsdemonstrate that the inflammatory responses induced by LPSare CD14 dependent as well as CD14 independent (CD11bdependent), but both of these signaling cascades are entirelydependent on TLR4 in a mouse model. To our knowledge, wedemonstrated here for the first time that modulation of TLR4function in the lung is a useful strategy for minimizing LPS-induced ALI in a mouse model.Although aerosolization of LPS-induced ALI is self-limitingin mouse models, this rodent model mimics several key fea-tures of human ALI and ARDS (11, 20). Our previous studieswith lung tissues and BALF cytospin preparations demon-strated that LPS instillation into mice results in the influx ofneutrophils and monocytes and severe inflammation in thelung in a time-dependent fashion within 24 h (17). In addition,this model permits analysis of the roles of CD14 and TLR4when appropriate gene-deficient or mutant mouse strains areused.The role of CD14 in the induction of ALI in mice has beendemonstrated largely by using blocking antibodies in responseto systemic LPS or aerosolized LPS. CD14 blockade experi-ments performed with various neutralizing antibodies resultedin a range of effects on lung inflammation in mice in an incon-sistent fashion (16, 34). These observations were probably dueto several inherent limitations of the procedure, such as (i) thebinding sites of some of those antibodies are not known (34);FIG. 7. Blocking TLR4 abolishes ALI induced by a low dose of LPS, as demonstrated by the neutrophil counts in BALF (A), the MPO activityin the lungs at 8 and 24 h (B), the BALF cytokine profiles at 2 h (C), and the lung histopathology at 24 h after inhalation of LPS (D and E). Thevalues are means \ufffd standard deviations. Values that are significantly different for the anti-TLR4-Ab-treated and isotype control Ab-treated groupsprior to LPS treatment are indicated by asterisks (P \ufffd 0.05; eight mice/group).

IMMUN.(ii) blocking may not be useful since soluble CD14 in serumreplaces the membrane-bound form (mCD14) in terms of sig-naling mainly in nonmyeloid cells (13, 32); and (iii) CD14-dependent signaling and CD14-independent signaling exist inmacrophages (27). The precise mechanisms by which LPS in-duces ALI via CD14 in the lung as a whole representing severalcell types are still debatable. Our study demonstrated that ALIinduced by a low dose of LPS is totally dependent on CD14;however, at a high dose of LPS, ALI is only partially mediatedby CD14. By contrast, Andoneui et al. (3) demonstrated thatLPS-induced neutrophil influx in the lung is entirely dependenton CD14; the reason for the apparent discrepancy is that theroute of LPS administration (intraperitoneal), the dose of LPS(0.5 mg/kg), and the time after LPS treatment that lungs wereharvested (4.5 h) were different in their study (3).The potential mechanisms for the CD14-independent andTLR4-dependent signaling via LPS include Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) (10, 15, 24) and the macrophage scavenger receptor,which are known to bind LPS and induce signaling (15). Otherexplanations for CD14-independent and TLR4-dependent sig-naling include (i) higher-affinity binding of LPS to TLR4 thanto CD14 (1); (ii) changes in the avidity of the LPS-TLR4complex upon the initial LPS binding (32); (iii) the involve-ment of heat shock proteins 70 and 90, growth differentiationfactor 5, and chemokine receptor 4, since these molecules forma CD14-independent signal transduction mechanism in re-sponse to LPS (35); and (iv) the presence of MD-2, since arecent report showed that MD-2 is a bona fide LPS-bindingprotein that does not need the assistance of LPS-binding pro-tein or CD14 to induce signaling via TLR4 (36, 37). Most ofthese mechanisms have been identified in individual cell types.Since the lung as a whole represents a broad spectrum of celltypes, it is extremely difficult to test these possibilities in vivo.Despite these limitations, our results demonstrate for the firsttime that ALI induced by a high dose of LPS in CD14\ufffd/\ufffd miceis totally dependent on CD11b, suggesting that this is the majormechanism in the CD14-independent pathway in the lung inresponse to LPS.LPS signaling involves interaction of LBP, CD14, MD2, andTLR4, although LBP, CD14, and MD-2 have no intrinsic sig-naling properties (10). TLR4 is a germ line-encoded trans-membrane signaling protein that recognizes microbial prod-ucts, including E. coli LPS, and induces signaling upon bindingto LPS (14). Binding of LPS to TLR4 in conjunction with otherFIG. 8. Blocking TLR4 attenuates ALI in response to a high dose of LPS, as shown by the neutrophil counts in BALF (A), the lung MPOactivity at 8 and 24 h (B), the BALF cytokine profiles at 2 h (C), and the lung histopathology at 24 h after inhalation of saline (D and E) or LPS(F and G). The values are means \ufffd standard deviations. Values that are significantly different for anti-TLR4-Ab-treated and isotype Ab-treatedgroups prior to the LPS challenge are indicated by asterisks (P \ufffd 0.05; eight mice/group).

On theother hand, another study demonstrated that factors otherthan TLR4 were involved in the secretion of TNF-\ufffd and MIP-2in the lungs in response to inhaled LPS (22). However, theauthors postulated that this response was due to low levels ofcontamination of the E. coli LPS used. This possibility is un-likely since the present study showed that TLR4 is solely re-sponsible for the induction of ALI via activation of NF-\ufffdB andsubsequent production of cytokines.Since our results demonstrated that LPS-induced ALI ispartially dependent on CD14 but fully dependent on TLR4, wedecided to determine whether TLR4 blocking is a useful strat-egy for minimizing ALI in normal and healthy wild-typeC57BL/6 mice. Blocking the critical first step of LPS binding toTLR4 by anti-TLR4 antibody was effective in attenuating ALIwith both low and high doses of LPS. To our knowledge, thisis the first report showing that a TLR4-blocking antibody re-duces the characteristic features of ALI, including an increasein the total WBC count, neutrophil influx and sequestration inthe lung, and lung histology induced by LPS. This could serveas a basis for future investigations to study the role of TLR4 inthe pathogenesis of ALI in humans leading to pulmonary in-flammation and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syn-drome.In summary, the results presented here for the first timedemonstrate that LPS-induced host responses are entirely de-pendent on TLR4 and are only partially dependent on CD14 inan in vivo mouse model. Furthermore, we found that CD11bcontributes to the CD14-independent pathway in the lungs inresponse to LPS. Collectively, these observations suggest thatTLR4 is an attractive target for immunomodulation. Our datasupport that blocking the extracellular domain of TLR4 is abeneficial therapeutic strategy for minimizing lung diseases inwhich LPS from gram-negative pathogens has been implicatedas the primary etiological agent.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by NIH grants P50HL067671-03 andRR14466.We thank Kenneth Malcolm and Mike Fessler for helpful discus-sions and Paul Kubes for providing the protocol for the MPO assay.REFERENCES1.
