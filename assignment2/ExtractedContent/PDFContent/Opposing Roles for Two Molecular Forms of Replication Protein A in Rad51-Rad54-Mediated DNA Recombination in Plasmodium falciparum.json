"Opposing Roles for Two Molecular Forms of Replication Protein A inRad51-Rad54-Mediated DNA Recombination in PlasmodiumfalciparumAnusha M. Gopalakrishnan, Nirbhay KumarDepartment of Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USAABSTRACT The bacterial RecA protein and its eukaryotic homologue Rad51 play a central role in the homologous DNA strandexchange reaction during recombination and DNA repair. Previously, our lab has shown that PfRad51, the Plasmodium falci-parum homologue of Rad51, exhibited ATPase activity and promoted DNA strand exchange in vitro. In this study, we evaluatedthe catalytic functions of PfRad51 in the presence of putative interacting partners, especially P. falciparum homologues of Rad54and replication protein A. PfRad54 accelerated PfRad51-mediated pairing between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and its homol-ogous linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2. We also present evidence that recombinantPfRPA1L protein serves the function of the bacterial homologue single-stranded binding protein (SSB) in initiating homologouspairing and strand exchange activity. More importantly, the function of PfRPA1L was negatively regulated in a dose-dependentmanner by PfRPA1S, another RPA homologue in P. falciparum. Finally, we present in vivo evidence through comet assays formethyl methane sulfonate-induced DNA damage in malaria parasites and accompanying upregulation of PfRad51, PfRad54,PfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S at the level of transcript and protein needed to repair DNA damage. This study provides new insightsinto the role of putative Rad51-interacting proteins involved in homologous recombination and emphasizes the physiologicalrole of DNA damage repair during the growth of parasites.IMPORTANCE Homologous recombination plays a major role in chromosomal rearrangement, and Rad51 protein, aided by sev-eral other proteins, plays a central role in DNA strand exchange reaction during recombination and DNA repair. This study re-ports on the characterization of the role of P. falciparum Rad51 in homologous strand exchange and DNA repair and evaluatesthe functional contribution of PfRad54 and PfRPA1 proteins. Data presented here provide mechanistic insights into DNA re-combination and DNA damage repair mechanisms in this parasite. The importance of these research findings in future work willbe to investigate if Rad51-dependent mechanisms are involved in chromosomal rearrangements during antigenic variation inP. falciparum. A prominent determinant of antigenic variation, the extraordinary ability of the parasite to rapidly change itssurface molecules, is associated with var genes, and antigenic variation presents a major challenge to vaccine development.Received 4 April 2013 Accepted 8 April 2013 Published 30 April 2013Citation Gopalakrishnan AM, Kumar N. 2013.

Mechanisms of gene expression and rearrange-ment during various phases of parasite development in the verte-brate and invertebrate hosts and during disease and immuneevasion are poorly understood. The virulence of Plasmodium fal-ciparum, one of the four established parasite species causing hu-man malaria, is thought to result, at least in part, from the way inwhich parasites modify antigens on the surface of infected eryth-rocytes (2). This phenomenon, known as antigenic variation, hasimplications for severe and pregnancy-associated malaria and forthe development of an efficient vaccine (3). DNA recombinationis thought to play a role in generating diversity within the var genefamily.The exchange of genetic information between allelic sequenceshas essential roles in eliminating deleterious lesions, such as DNAdouble-strand breaks (DSB), preserving replication forks forchromosome segregation during meiosis and for maintenance ofgenomic integrity (4). The class of enzymes that catalyze this pro-cess are known as recombinases, and their assembly on homolo-gous DNA sequences is a rate-limiting process, mediated by anumber of accessory factors (5). Eukaryotic Rad51, like its bacte-rial homologue RecA, is an essential protein for mitotic homolo-gous recombination (HR) events and catalyzes the pairing andinteractions between homologous DNA strands necessary for pro-moting single-strand exchange (SSE). Similar to Escherichia coliRecA protein, ScRad51 and HsRad51 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) and Homo sapiens, respectively, have been shown to playroles in promoting SSE between homologous sequences by bind-ing to DNA and forming nucleoprotein filaments (6, 7). Previ-ously, our lab has shown that PfRad51, the homologue of Rad51 inRESEARCH ARTICLEMay/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 1http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/mbio.asm.orgP. falciparum, exhibited ATPase activity, promoted DNA SSE invitro (8), and may play a functional role(s) during HR, rearrange-ments, and DNA damage repair.Another key player in HR is Rad54, a member of the Swi2/Snf2subfamily of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-dependent AT-Pases (9, 10). Rad54 interacts with Rad51 and plays roles in mul-tiple stages of HR (11, 12). A role for the Rad54 homologue inP. falciparum and its involvement in facilitating activities ofPfRad51 are not known. Replication protein A (RPA), anothermolecular component involved in HR, is a heterotrimeric com-plex, vital for DNA replication, repair, and recombination (13,14). RPA has been shown to consist of 70-kDa (RPA1), 32-kDa(RPA2), and 14-kDa (RPA3) subunits (15). Genes encoding RPAsubunits have been identified and described in several protozoanparasites, such as Cryptosporidium parvum CpRPA1 (16),Crithidia fasciculata CfRPA1 (17), and P. falciparum PfRPA1 (18).RPA1 is present in two different forms in C. parvum, Toxoplasmagondii, and P. falciparum. The two open reading frames (ORFs) ofthe RPA1 gene in P. falciparum encode a truncated short RPA1Sprotein (PFI0235w; ~50 kDa) and a longer RPA1L protein(PFD0475c; ~134 kDa) (18, 19), differentially expressed across theparasite life cycle, indicating the different possible roles duringparasite development (19). Although the biochemical functions ofthe RPA1 complex have been well detailed in humans and yeasts,their role in the malaria parasite is not known. Detailed biochem-ical characterization of the recombination proteins PfRad54 andPfRPA1 may provide further insights into DNA recombinationand DNA damage repair mechanisms in these organisms.In this study, we sought to characterize molecular componentsof the recombination machinery in P. falciparum to provide amechanistic understanding of recombinational DNA rearrange-ment. We evaluated the catalytic functions of PfRad51 in the pres-ence of the putative interacting partners PfRad54, PfRPA1L, andPfRPA1S and divalent cations. Our data indicate that a coordi-nated involvement of these proteins may play a functional role inHR and DNA repair mechanisms in the malaria parasite and mayprovide additional targets for the development of novel antima-laria drugs. A long-term significance of our studies lies in the po-tential to investigate recombinational rearrangement of the vargenes involved in antigenic variation, one of the major impedi-ments in generating protective immune responses against a widearray of genetically diverse malaria parasites.RESULTSIdentification of homologues of the components of recombina-tion machinery in P. falciparum. We have previously cloned andcharacterized PfRad51, a P. falciparum recombinase (8). Miningthe P. falciparum genome database also revealed that Dmc1(MAL8P1.76), MRE11 (PFA0390w), and Rad54 are involved inHR; however, Rad52, whose association with DSB has been shownto be a prerequisite for the recruitment of Rad51 protein (20),appears to be absent in P. falciparum. A lack of PfRad52 stressedthat other interacting proteins must be influencing or regulatingRad51-mediated SSE reactions in P. falciparum. When thePfRad54 sequence was aligned with other eukaryotic Rad54 se-quences, it revealed regions of considerable sequence similarityand dissimilarity, including gaps and insertions (see Fig. S1 and S2in the supplemental material). Figure 1A identifies the conserva-tion of various functional domains in PfRad54; the N-terminalregion is expected to contain a putative Rad51 interaction do-main, and the functional significance of the C-terminal region inPfRad54 is unknown. The P. falciparum genome also encodes twoRPA1 subunits (PFI0235w and PFD0475c), a single RPA2 subunit(chr11.phat_340), and a single RPA3 subunit (PF07_0039). TheORFs of the RPA1 subunits encode a truncated short PfRPA1Sprotein (~50 kDa) and a longer PfRPA1L protein (~134 kDa) (18,19), compared to only a single molecule in higher eukaryotes(Fig. S2). PfRPA1L contains an extended N terminus (Fig. 1B) anda Zn finger motif in the N-terminal region lacking in PfRPA1S.Proteomics data (http://www.plasmodb.org) and a reportedprotein-DNA binding study (18) suggest that PfRPA1L andPfRPA1S bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affin-ity. None of the molecules involved in nonhomologous end join-ing (NHEJ) were revealed in the Plasmodium genome sequence.Purification of recombinant His-tagged PfRad51, PfRad54 (1to 164), PfRPA1L (678 to 1145), and PfRPA1S proteins. Recom-binant PfRad51 was purified (Fig. 1C) as described previously (8).The amino-terminal region (amino acid residues 1 to 164) corre-sponding to putative PfRad51-interacting domain A of PfRad54,and the ssDNA binding domains of PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S wereexpressed as 6\ufffdHis-tagged products and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) beads (Fig. 1A). Figure 1C shows thepurified PfRad54, PfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S proteins used in vari-ous functional assays. The size and purity were confirmed by Coo-massie blue staining and Western blot analysis using anti-6\ufffdHistag conjugate antibody (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., CA), whichrecognizes His tag expressed in all the recombinant proteins.The N-terminal domain of recombinant PfRad54 protein ac-celerates homologous DNA SSE in the presence of recombinantPfRad51 and CaCl2. The role of Rad54, a protein that belongs tothe core enzymatic machinery of HR in eukaryotes, has beenshown to stimulate the SSE activity of Rad51 (21). In order toestablish a functional role for Rad54 in the malaria parasite, wepurified the N-terminal region of PfRad54 (amino acids [aa] 1 to164) and evaluated its participation in SSE catalyzed by PfRad51.Linear dsDNA (\u00f8X 174) and homologous circular \u00f8X 174 ssDNAsubstrates were incubated in the presence of ATP, MgCl2,PfRad51, and single-stranded binding protein (SSB), as previouslyreported (8). PfRad51-mediated SSE was noticeable at the 15-min(Fig. 2B, panel I) time point. We next supplemented the SSE re-action with purified PfRad54 (2 \ufffdM) in the presence or absence ofCaCl2. The kinetics of PfRad51-catalyzed SSE with or withoutPfRad54 were comparable (Fig. 2B, panel II); however, the pres-ence of 0.5 mM CaCl2 and PfRad54 accelerated the formation ofintermediate products from 15 min in the absence of CaCl2 to10 min in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2B, panel III; see also Fig. S3in the supplemental material). PfRad54 and CaCl2 in the absenceof PfRad51 were not effective in the SSE (data not shown). Thisobservation is in agreement with the idea that Ca2\ufffd is a universalcofactor of DNA SSE promoted by mammalian homologous re-combination proteins in vitro (22). These results also support thatthe PfRad54 region chosen for expression for functional studies isindeed capable of interacting with PfRad51 during SSE.Recombinant PfRPA1L serves the function of SSB, whereasrecombinant PfRPA1S does not exhibit any SSB-like function.To test the function of the two RPA1 subunits in SSE in Plasmo-dium, we performed the SSE using PfRPA1L instead of SSB. Asshown in Fig. 3A (panel II), when PfRPA1L was used in place ofSSB, PfRPA1L was able to efficiently initiate SSE catalyzed byPfRad51. The kinetics of this reaction was found to be similar toGopalakrishnan and Kumar2 \u00ae mbio.asm.org May/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13http://www.plasmodb.orgmbio.asm.orgthat of SSB, and the intermediate products were visible at the15-min time point of the reaction (Fig. 3A, panels I and II). On theother hand, PfRPA1S did not initiate a SSE reaction, even after45 min of the reaction (Fig. 3A, panel III). These results suggestthat PfRPA1L exhibits an SSB-like function in SSE initiationwhereas PfRPA1S does not exhibit any such function.PfRPA1S downregulates the function of PfRPA1L but notSSB. Intrigued by the presence of two molecular forms of RPA1 inP. falciparum, we performed SSE assays in the presence of bothPfRPA1L and PfRPA1S. When equal molar amounts of PfRPA1Land PfRPA1S (0.5 \ufffdM) were added to initiate the reaction, therewas a delay in the reaction initiation (from 15 min to 30 min)(Fig. 3B, panel I). A further increase in the PfRPA1S concentrationto 1 \ufffdM (2-fold molar excess over PfRPA1L) deferred the reactionfrom 30 min to 60 min (Fig. 3B, panel III), and no intermediateproducts were seen even 120 min after reaction initiation whenPfRPA1S was increased to 2 \ufffdM (4-fold molar excess overPfRPA1L) (Fig. 3B, panel IV). This inhibitory activity of PfRPA1Swas observed even if SSE was carried out in the presence ofPfRad54 and 0.5 mM CaCl2 (data not shown).In view of the negative regulation of PfRPA1L by PfRPA1S, wealso investigated whether or not the order in which these two wereadded to initiate the reaction would influence the outcome. Thereaction was first initiated with PfRPA1S (0.5 \ufffdM) for 10 min,followed by addition of PfRPA1L (0.5 \ufffdM). The SSE was delayedto 30 min as previously seen (Fig. 3B, panel V) when the two wereadded simultaneously. The negative effect of 0.5 \ufffdM PfRPA1S wasnullified if the amount of PfRPA1L was doubled to 1 \ufffdM insteadof the standard 0.5 \ufffdM (Fig. 3B, panel VI), suggesting titrability ofnegative regulatory activity of PfRPA1S by PfRPA1L.Recombinant PfRPA1L can initiate SSE in the presence ofboth PfRad51 and the bacterial homologue RecA. To further testwhether the inhibition of SSE by PfRPA1S was a generalized effector specific to PfRPA1L, we incubated equal amounts of SSB andPfRPA1S (0.5 \ufffdM) to initiate the reaction. As seen in Fig. 3C,panel I, there was no delay in the reaction by PfRPA1S carried outin the presence of SSB, suggesting that PfRPA1S specifically slowsdown or inhibits the activity of PfRPA1L. To further characterizethe SSB-like function of PfRPA1L, we compared SSE activity ini-tiated by RecA. As shown in Fig. 3C, panel II, PfRPA1L can facil-itate RecA-mediated SSE as efficiently as SSB, further suggestingthat PfRPA1L is indeed a functional homologue of SSB in P. falci-parum. Not surprisingly, PfRPA1S was not active in the presenceof RecA, as there were no intermediate products formed even after60 min (Fig. 3C, panel III). When PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S wereincubated together in the presence of RecA, PfRPA1S again de-FIG 1 (A) Schematic representation of ScRad54 and PfRad54 proteins.

(i) Tran-scriptional effects. Exposure to the DNA-alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) has been shown to lead to overexpres-sion of rad51 (23\u201325), rad54 (26\u201328), and rpa1 (29, 30). Thesestudies also showed that mutation of the above-mentioned genesmade the cells sensitive to MMS, indicating their roles in DNArepair. Previously, we have shown that Plasmodium Rad51 is up-regulated in response to DNA damage created by MMS. We thenstudied MMS-induced changes in the expression of PfRad54 andPfRPA1 (long [L] and short [S] forms) initially by reversetranscription-PCR (RT-PCR) (data not shown), followed byquantitative real-time PCR. Figure 4A shows relative quantifica-tion measured by the Pfaffl method (31) and the average thresholdcycle (\ufffd\ufffdCT) value of each gene across the different erythrocyticstages (rings, trophozoites, and schizonts). The average \ufffd\ufffdCT val-ues for induced PfRad51 and PfRad54 in the ring and trophozoitestages of P. falciparum were 2 to 2.5 times higher than those inuninduced parasites. However, the highest fold induction de-tected was 11 to 30 times in the schizont stages. The transcrip-tional changes for pfrpa1L and pfrpa1S were also 10 to 100 timeshigher than those for control samples, suggesting that genes forboth S and L forms of RPA1 are also induced during MMS treat-ment. This finding suggests coregulation and functional involve-ment of both RPA1L and RPA1S during the DNA damage repairprocess in the malaria parasites. The P values were corrected usingthe Bonferroni method, and P values of the various samples were\ufffd0.0001 to 0.0016, suggesting that there was a statistically signif-icant difference between the uninduced and MMS-induced sam-ples across the erythrocytic cycle for all four genes tested, indicat-ing the functional significance of these genes in the parasitesundergoing active DNA replication. To rule out any genomicDNA (gDNA) contamination in any of the samples, the unin-duced and induced samples were amplified with or without a re-verse transcription step as well as using primers for a housekeep-ing stress-related gene, Pfgrp78 (32). Equal amounts of total RNAfrom control and MMS-treated parasites were used in these stud-ies. Transcripts (amplified 434-bp product) for Pfgrp78 were ofcomparable intensities in uninduced and induced samples in thelife cycle stages of the parasite (see Fig. S4 in the supplementalmaterial). These primers also amplify a 289-bp-larger band fromgenomic DNA templates due to the presence of an intron, andthese results rule out any genomic DNA contamination in theRNA preparations. Likewise, no PCR products were seen when thereverse transcription step was omitted (Fig. S5).FIG 2 (A) Schematic representation of the SSE assay.

Western blot analysis was carried outto further demonstrate that MMS induction was seen at the pro-tein level as well. Previously, our lab has shown that MMS treat-ment resulted in the induction of PfRad51 expression (33). Wetreated synchronized ring-, trophozoite-, and schizont-stage par-asites for 6 h with 0.05% and 0.005% MMS. The expression ofPfRad54 was assessed using the ScRad54 antibody (a generous giftfrom Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, UC, Davis), which recognizes recom-binant truncated PfRad54 expressed in E. coli (23 kDa) (Fig. 4B,lane 2) and full-length PfRad54 (140 kDa) in the P. falciparumlysates. Pooled preimmune serum (negative controls) did not rec-ognize any proteins in the parasite lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Threeindependent experiments were performed, and Fig. 4C shows re-sults of one such typical experiment. Treatment with 0.05% and0.005% MMS showed a marked induction in PfRad51 andPfRad54 expression (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that theexpression of both PfRad51 and PfRad54 is upregulated in re-sponse to exposure to a DNA-damaging agent, thereby stronglysuggesting a conserved role for PfRad54, just like PfRad51 in therecombinational repair process. Similar Western blot analysis forRPA1 (L and S forms) could not be performed due to nonavail-ability of specific antibodies.(iii) Evidence for DNA damage by MMS and DNA repair inmalaria parasites. MMS is a known DNA-damaging agent andhas been shown to induce PfRad51 (33). We wanted to establishthat such induction of recombination molecules in P. falciparumis indeed in response to actual DNA damage caused by MMS in theparasite. To visualize and quantify DNA damage, we performedComet assays and analyzed DNA damage in individual cells. Theshapes of the DNA comet tail and migration pattern were evalu-ated to assess the extent of DNA damage. As seen in Fig. 5A, max-imum comets were seen in the MMS-treated schizont stage (aver-age Olive tail moment [OTM], 18.1) compared to rings (1.5) andtrophozoites (11.8). In order to establish a functional DNA repairprocess in P. falciparum, we then assessed the ability of these par-asites to repair damaged DNA in a \u201creturn-to-growth\u201d experi-ment. Figure 5B illustrates a correlation between the Olive tailmoment (the product of the proportion of tail intensity and thedisplacement of tail center of mass relative to the center of thehead) and the parasitemia over various time points during thereturn-to-growth phase. Parasite growth was restored to normallevels in MMS-treated samples after 42 h, and it was comparable tothat of control samples (mock treated) maintained in parallel. Thecomet OTM (with a larger value indicating DNA damage) wasinversely proportional to parasitemia, as parasites repaired dam-aged DNA and returned to normal growth. Starting from a valueof 56.1 immediately after MMS treatment, the OTM values de-creased to 41.3 at 12 h, 21.6 at 18 h, and 2.6 at 42 h, providingevidence for the presence of DNA damage during the first 18 hfollowed by repair of DNA damage and restoration of parasitegrowth by 42 h (Fig. 5C and D).

The scoring included the totalnumber of nuclei, the number of intact heads (undamaged), andthe number of comets (damaged), and the percentages of dam-aged and undamaged nuclei were calculated before (0 h) and 6 hafter MMS treatment as well as at 12, 18, and 42 h during theback-to-growth condition. In parallel, control samples (mocktreatment) were also analyzed at the indicated time points. As seenin Fig. 5C and D, as the parasite growth recovered, it was accom-panied by repair of damaged DNA, indicated by an increase in thepercentage of intact undamaged nuclei and a gradual decrease inthe OTM values. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis revealed arho value of \ufffd0.96, indicating a negative correlation betweenOTM and percent parasite growth recovery. These studies provideexperimental evidence for MMS-induced DNA damage in theparasite and the involvement of functional DNA repair mecha-nisms in response to DNA damage.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have provided new insights into the role of theinteracting partners of Rad51, Rad54, and RPA and their involve-ment in HR and DNA repair in P. falciparum. Failure to identifyhomologues of PfRad52 and the accessory proteins PfRad55 andPfRad57 by genome mining and the presence of two RPAs distinctfrom those of other higher eukaryotic cells suggest that DNA re-pair mechanisms in Plasmodium have evolved to retain functionalsimilarities as well as unique features compared to other species.Previously, we have shown that Rad51 participates in HR mecha-nisms in the apicomplexan parasite P. falciparum. Rad51 has beenshown to be present in other parasites: Leishmania Rad51 (Lm-Rad51) and Entamoeba histolytica Rad51 (EhRad51) have beenshown to bind to DNA and exhibit DNA-stimulated ATPase ac-tivity (34, 35), and Trypanosome Rad51 has been suggested to playa regulatory role in variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) switching(36). In other species, Rad54 and Rad51 form a complex nucleo-protein filament which stimulates Rad51, leading to translocationof target DNA to the site of homology search (37, 38). The absenceof Rad52 and accessory proteins emphasizes the importance of thefunctional role of PfRad54 in facilitating PfRad51-mediated re-combination and DNA repair. Unlike PfRad51, PfRad54 did notinitiate SSE by itself; rather, it accelerated the reaction when com-bined with PfRad51 and Ca2\ufffd. Deletion analysis has shown thatFIG 4 Induction of recombination molecules by MMS. (A) Transcriptional changes upon MMS treatment, analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Parasite cultureswere synchronized by the sorbitol method, and cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA from rings, trophozoites, and schizonts. Untreated and 0.05% and0.005% MMS-treated samples from each stage were collected for analysis. cDNA was then amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (see Table S2 in thesupplemental material) using the Bio-Rad IQ5 real-time PCR detection system.

We therefore focused our initial attempts on theN-terminal domain of PfRad54, a region homologous to ScRad54which interacts with ScRad51, to study its role in SSE. Due to itslarge size (153 kDa), we did not attempt to express full-lengthPfRad54, which would have also included the DNA binding do-main. We are not sure if this might account for the lack of SSEactivity of PfRad54 alone.The recruitment of Rad51 and Rad54 to the site of HR dependssolely on the mode of action of single-stranded binding proteins(SSB), replication proteins (RPA eukaryotic homologues), andthe DNA repair protein Rad52, all of which bind and stabilizesingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The P. falciparum genome en-codes two RPA1 subunits (http://www.plasmodb.org), PfRPA1Land PfRPA1S, expressed differentially across the parasite life cycle,suggesting different possible roles of these subunits during para-site development (19). The absence of the Rad52 homologue inP. falciparum also suggests the importance of PfRPA1 proteins inengaging PfRad51 and PfRad54 at the site of recombination. Ourresults demonstrated an SSB-like function for PfRPA1L, whereasthe role of PfRPA1S remains intriguing. PfRPA1S alone did notexhibit any SSE activity, and importantly, it resulted in aconcentration-dependent inhibition of the activity of PfRPA1L,suggesting that PfRPA1S may be a regulator for PfRPA1L and SSEactivity in P. falciparum. Considering that a Rad52 homologue isabsent in Plasmodium and RPA1S does not exhibit SSE activity,the role of PfRPA1L becomes more critical in initiating SSE viaremoval of secondary structures from ssDNA. The observationthat PfRPA1S specifically delayed or inhibited the reaction ofPfRPA1L and not the bacterial homologue SSB further indicatesthat PfRPA1S likely interacts with PfRPA1L directly. These find-ings are significant, keeping in mind that Rad52 recruits Rad51,which interacts with ssDNA by displacing RPA (40, 41). In theabsence of Rad52 in Plasmodium, we speculate that, dependingupon the stoichiometry of available RPA1S and RPA1L, an inter-action between RPA1S and RPA1L acts to limit the recruitment ofPfRad51 to DNA and, hence, reduced SSE. We do not know ifPfRPA1S prevents PfRad51 from binding to ssDNA or interactswith PfRPA1L directly and modulates its function. Since PfRPA1Sis upregulated at the transcriptional level in response to a DNA-damaging agent, it is expected to participate in DNA damagerepair and may even play an important role at a DNA damagecheckpoint. We are investigating the biochemical nature and stoi-FIG 5 Evidence for DNA damage and DNA repair.

(B) Parasite growth versus Comet assay olive tail moment at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 42 h after MMS (0.05%) treatmentcompared to untreated parasites. The error bars represent the SEM. Parasitemia differences between the MMS-treated and control samples were not statisticallysignificant. (C) Parasite recovery versus Comet assay olive tail moment. Comet assay data were analyzed to score damaged and undamaged nuclei for each sample.Shown are Comet assay results indicating DNA repair through percent recovery in MMS-treated and control parasites at 12 h, 18 h, and 42 h of the recoveryperiod. The majority of parasites (97%) were recovered at 18 h, with only 3% of parasites exhibiting a high OTM value (21.6). The error bars represent the SEM.(D) Parasite recovery visualization by Comet assay at 12 h, 18 h, and 42 h (no visually detectable tail) during the return to growth after MMS treatment.Recombination and DNA Damage Repair in Parasite GrowthMay/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 7http://www.plasmodb.orgmbio.asm.orgchiometry of this interaction, suggested by our studies to be animportant regulator in Plasmodium HR and DNA damage repair.In response to a serious threat like DNA damage, cells are en-dowed with an elaborate battery of DNA repair machinery that istriggered by unrepaired DSBs. In Trypanosoma and Leishmania,Rad51 has been shown to play a critical role in DNA repair path-ways (34, 36). Previously, our lab has presented evidence for in-duction of PfRad51 in response to the DNA-damaging agentMMS (33), suggesting a conserved role for this gene in recombi-national repair processes in the protozoan parasites. Results nowpresented in the current study demonstrate that in addition to theinduction of PfRad51, expression of PfRad54, PfRPA1L, andPfRPA1S was significantly upregulated in response to MMS. Sincemaximum response was seen in the mitotically active trophozoitesand schizonts, it also suggests a link between the activity of recom-bination molecules and DNA replication.In addition, we have also shown that MMS does indeed causeDNA damage in P. falciparum. Using a Comet assay, we observedmaximum values for comet tails in the schizont stage (Fig. 5A)that are undergoing DNA replication. In order to establish a func-tional DNA repair process in P. falciparum, we performed return-to-growth experiments. Further evidence for functional DNA re-pair in response to DNA damage through analysis of recovery ofparasites in culture and reversal of DNA damage was revealed bycomet tail shortening. Both parasite growth and MMS-inducedDNA damage returned to normal values within 24 to 42 h of therecovery phase.Results of the studies presented suggest a role for Rad51,Rad54, RPA1L, and RPA1S in DNA repair and DNA recombina-tion. One point of regulation may be exerted at the level ofPfRPA1S. PfRPA1S was found to negatively regulate the functionof PfRPA1L, and during MMS-induced DNA damage, expressionof both PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S was markedly upregulated. Fur-ther studies are needed to define these molecular interactions. Ourcurrent observations allow us to speculate the following possibleroles of PfRPA1S, which are represented in Fig. S6 in the supple-mental material. In the absence of PfRPA1S, PfRPA1L efficientlyinitiates SSE catalyzed by PfRad51 and, hence, serves the functionof SSB (Fig. S6A). When PfRPA1S is also present, it likely interactswith PfRPA1L either directly or through yet-unknown mediatorsor cofactors and slows down the SSE, delaying product formation(Fig. S6B). In the presence of \ufffd4-fold molar excess of PfRPA1Scompared to PfRPA1L, no SSE occurs, indicating the titrability ofPfRPA1L by the negative regulatory activity exerted by PfRPA1S(Fig. S6C). The nature of the interaction of these macromolecularcomplexes in the parasites through various life cycle stages is cur-rently under investigation. Since the short form of RPA1 is presentin a few other apicomplexan parasites, e.g., Cryptosporidium andToxoplasma, our studies with PfRPA1S may provide an excellentmodel system to study DNA damage and repair as well as a poten-tial checkpoint in HR and DNA repair in these medically impor-tant apicomplexan parasites and other biological systems in whichmultiple forms of RPA1 are present.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning, expression, and purification of recombinant PfRad51,PfRad54, PfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S. Recombinant PfRad51 was purified asdescribed previously (8). The N-terminal (putative Rad51 interacting do-main) coding sequence of PfRad54 (GeneID Pf08_0126; bp 1 to 492 of thecoding sequence) was cloned into the expression vector pRsetA (Invitro-gen), giving rise to a product containing a 6-histidine tag at the N termi-nus of the expressed protein, referred to throughout as PfRad54. Afterverifying the sequence, the plasmid was transfected in Escherichia colihost strain BL21* (DE3)-pLys S (Invitrogen). Gene-specific oligonucleo-tides used for amplification are shown in Table S1 in the supple-mental material. Cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria broth containing50 \ufffdg/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. Ex-pression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG (isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (1 mM), and incubation continued for 3 h. Cellswere harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM phosphatebuffer, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% lysozyme) per gramof bacterial pellet, incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysed by sonication (3bursts of 1-min pulse at 4\u00b0C). The lysate was centrifuged at 17,500 \ufffd g for30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5,and 4 M urea, stirred at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 17,500 \ufffd g. Thesupernatant was loaded over a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) andwashed with phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8) containing 20 mM imida-zole, and bound protein was eluted with elution buffers (25 mM Tris-HCl,pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing increasing amounts of imidazole (50,100, 150, or 200 mM). The 200 mM imidazole elution fractions contain-ing recombinant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against the dialysisbuffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol[DTT], 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) to remove imidazole. The purifiedprotein was tested by Coomassie blue staining and Western blot analysisusing antibody specific for the 6\ufffdHis tag. The protein concentration wasmeasured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method and stored at \ufffd80\u00b0Cuntil further use.The 3= end of the PfRPA1L gene (GeneID PfD0470c; bp 2035 to3438 of the coding sequence, referred as PfRPA1L) and the full codingsequence of the PfRPA1S gene (GeneID PFI0235w; bp 1 to 1455) wereeach cloned into the expression vector pRsetA. Gene-specific oligonucle-otides used for amplification are shown in Table S1 in the supplementalmaterial. Cultures were grown at 30\u00b0C in Luria broth containing 50 \ufffdg/mlampicillin to an OD600 of 0.6. Expression of recombinant protein wasinduced by IPTG (0.5 mM), and incubation continued for 2 h at 25\u00b0C.Cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris,pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% lysozyme) pergram of bacterial pellet. The cultures were incubated on ice for 30 min andlysed by sonication (3 bursts of 1-min pulse at 4\u00b0C). The lysate was thencentrifuged at 17,500 \ufffd g for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded overa Ni-NTA-agarose column after column equilibration with 25 mM Tris,pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole.The column was washed with 25 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mMTris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole),and bound protein was eluted with elution buffers (25 mM Tris-HCl,pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing increasing amounts of imidazole (50,100, 150, 200, and 250 mM). The 250 mM imidazole elution fractionswere pooled and dialyzed against the dialysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) to remove imidazole.The purified protein was tested by Coomassie blue staining and Westernblot analysis using antibody specific for the 6\ufffdHis tag. The protein con-centration was measured by the BCA method and stored at \ufffd70\u00b0C untilfurther use.Single-stranded exchange assay. The assay mixture contained reac-tion buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol), 10 mM MgCl2,5 \ufffdM circular \ufffdX 174 RF I dsDNA (New England Biolabs [NEB]), 15 \ufffdM\ufffdX virion dsDNA (NEB), 1 mM DTT, and 2 \ufffdM concentrations of theproteins (RecA obtained from NEB M0249S, PfRad51, or PfRad54) to betested for functional activity. The reaction mixture (135 \ufffdl) was preincu-bated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by addition of 15 \ufffdl of an initiationmixture (final concentration of 25 mM Tri-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol,3 mM ATP, and 0.5 \ufffdM single-stranded binding protein [SSB from Strat-agene or PfRPA1L or PfRPA1S]). Aliquots were collected at indicatedtime points and quenched with stop solution (1% SDS, 15 mM EDTA),and the products were analyzed by 1% Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) agaroseGopalakrishnan and Kumar8 \u00ae mbio.asm.org May/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13mbio.asm.orggel electrophoresis. The gel was run overnight at 18V, stained for 1 h withethidium bromide (final concentration, 0.5 \ufffdg/ml), and visualized afterdestaining in water.Parasite culture, RNA extraction, and cDNA synthesis. P. falciparumclone 3D7 was grown at 4% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supple-mented with 10% O\ufffd normal human serum and red blood cells. Parasiteswere cultured at 37\u00b0C using the candle jar method (42) and visualized byGiemsa stain (43). Parasite cultures were synchronized by the sorbitolmethod as described previously (44). Synchronized ring-, trophozoite-,and schizont-stage parasites were treated with 0.005% and 0.05% methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) in the culture medium at 37\u00b0C, and aliquotswere collected for RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. RNA was extractedfrom MMS-treated and untreated parasites using Trizol reagent (Invitro-gen), and the concentration of RNA was measured using NanoDrop(model 2000/2000c). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribedusing oligo(dT)18 primer, a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Diag-nostics GmbH), and cycler protocol conditions as described by the man-ufacturer. The resulting cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification for30 cycles using gene-specific primers. Control reactions without reversetranscriptase were carried out to confirm that no DNA contamination waspresent in the RNA samples. The products were run on 1% agarose gel andstained with ethidium bromide.Western blot analysis. MMS-treated synchronized parasites were re-leased from red cells by 0.01% saponin lysis for 5 min at 0\u00b0C and washedtwo times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The samples wereanalyzed by Western blotting using a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse anti-PfRad51 (M. Bhattacharyya and N. Kumar, unpublished data), a 1:5,000dilution of mouse anti-ScRad54 (a kind gift from Wolf-Dietrich Heyer,UC, Davis), and a 1:7,500 dilution of mouse anti-PfHsp70 (45) antibodyusing enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-based detection methods(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Comet assays and DNA damage repair. MMS-treated synchronizedparasites corresponding to 4 \ufffd 105 infected red blood cells were collected,lysed with 0.01% saponin, washed three times with cold PBS, and finallyresuspended in 1.0 ml PBS for single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet as-says) (46). Diluted cells (30 \ufffdl) were mixed with 300 \ufffdl Comet LMAga-rose (1% low-temperature melting agarose [Trevigen, Gaithersburg,MD]), and the mixture was added to wells of a Trevigen slide, incubated at4\u00b0C for 30 min, and immersed in chilled lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl,100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, 1% N-lauryl-sarcosine, 1% TritonX-100) at 4\u00b0C for 60 min. Excess lysis solution was removed from slidesand then transferred to a clean tray immersed in alkaline lysis solution(200 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA), rinsed for 5 min in 1\ufffd Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE), and electrophoresed for 10 min at 1 volt/cm in 1\ufffd TBE.Slides were fixed in 70% ethanol and dried overnight. Wells were stainedwith 50 \ufffdl freshly prepared SYBR green I and photographed at \ufffd200magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon) with a Sensicam QEhigh-performance camera (Cooke Corporation). Comets were scored forall samples using Comet assay IV software. Control parasites exposed to a5-Gy dose of radiation (cesium 137; Gammacell-40 by NordIon Interna-tional) were used to guide Comet assay software (Trevigen, Gaithersburg,MD) for quantitation of DNA damage. An automatic scoring methodmeasured comet head and tail lengths, head and tail percent intensity, tailmigration, and Olive tail moment (OTM) (the product of the tail lengthand the fraction of total DNA in the tail). To study the efficiency of theDNA damage repair process in P. falciparum, parasites were treated with0.05% MMS (6 h at 37\u00b0C), washed, and recultured in the presence of freshgrowth medium and uninfected erythrocytes for 42 h. Cultures were har-vested at various intervals (12, 18, and 42 h) to prepare blood smears tocheck parasite growth and DNA damage by Comet assays. For each sam-ple (control and MMS treatment) and each time point, three replicateswere performed and an average of their OTM values was used for dataanalysis.Real-time quantitative PCR. RNA preparation and cDNA synthesisdetails were as explained above. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) samples wereprepared in IQ SYBR green Supermix containing SYBR green dye, iTaqDNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and buffers(Bio-Rad), 0.4 \ufffdM concentrations of each oligonucleotide primer (seeTable S2 in the supplemental material), and a 1:100 dilution of the cDNAreaction. Amplification was performed on a Bio-Rad IQ5 real-time PCRdetection system using 95\u00b0C for 2 min for initial denaturation and enzymeactivation, followed by a further incubation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and 45cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. P. falciparum seryltRNA synthetase (GeneID PF07_0073) was used as an internal controlgene. A set of three independent replicates was obtained, and the averagevalue from that was taken for data analysis.Data analysis and statistical evaluation. Relative CT values from real-time RT-PCR in the induced and uninduced samples were calculated byusing the Pfaffl method (31). Briefly, the average CT value from threeindependent replicates of the internal control gene (seryl tRNA synthe-tase) was subtracted from the average CT value for each sample (control orinduced) to calculate the \ufffdCT. The \ufffdCT for each sample was divided bythe \ufffdCT of the control (uninduced sample) to obtain the \ufffd\ufffdCT. Theinverse of \ufffd\ufffdCT raised to the power of two determines the initial amountof DNA in each sample. The experimental standard deviation (SD) wascalculated by the square root of the sum of the squares of the SD of eachsample and the internal control. Finally, using the \ufffdCT and the experi-mental SD, the induced sample was compared with the respective unin-duced sample using InStat software (GraphPad) to calculate P values. Thestatistical adjustment for the multiple comparisons was accommodatedby correcting the P value by the Bonferroni method.SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALSupplemental material for this article may be found at http://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00252-13/-/DCSupplemental.Figure S1, PDF file, 0.2 MB.Figure S2, PDF file, 0.3 MB.Figure S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S4, PDF file, 0.2 MB.Figure S5, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Figure S6, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Table S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.Table S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Mrinal Bhattacharyya for discussions during the early stages ofthese studies, Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, UC, Davis, for the generous gift of theScRad54 antibody, William Wimley, Tulane School of Medicine, for help-ful discussions on statistical analyses, Joni Emmons for editorial com-ments, and Melody C.
