"A novel function for p21Cip1 and acetyltransferase p/CAF as critical transcriptional regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasionRESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessA novel function for p21Cip1 and acetyltransferasep/CAF as critical transcriptional regulators of TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasionMeiou Dai1, Amal A Al-Odaini1, Ani Arakelian2, Shafaat A Rabbani2, Suhad Ali1 and Jean-Jacques Lebrun1*AbstractIntroduction: Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancermetastasis, the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death. Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1(p21), a member of the core cell cycle machinery, in transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb)-mediated breastcancer cell migration and invasion.Methods: A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and localinvasion. The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25,SUM159PT, SUM149PT, SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFb and the protein expressionlevels were measured by Western blot. Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healingand Transwell assay. TGFb transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFb/Smad reporter construct (CAGA12-luc) usingluciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFb downstream target genes. The interactions among p21, p/CAF andSmad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNAimmunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes. Finally, the association among activeTGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissuemicroarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive.Results: We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breastcancer patients. Furthermore, using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies, we found p21 to be essential fortumor cell invasion. The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3, and p/CAF interactiondownstream of TGFb. p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFb-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controllingSmad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In addition, we found that active TGFb/Smad signalingcorrelates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays frombreast cancer patients.Conclusions: Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cellmigration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy.Introductionp21 was originally identified as a cell cycle regulatorthrough inhibition of different cyclin/cyclin-dependentkinase complexes [1]. p21 is a member of the Cip/Kipfamily of cell cycle inhibitors, which also includesp27Kip1 and p57Kip2 [2-4]. In addition to its role in cellcycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellularsenescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytos-keleton [5-7]. The role of p21 in breast cancer develop-ment and progression has not been fully investigated.While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a down-stream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it doesnot fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor.Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are notcommon in human cancers [8]. Furthermore, in vivo stu-dies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss ofp21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cellsto undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these* Correspondence: jj.lebrun@mcgill.ca1Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill UniversityHealth Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, QC, CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleDai et al.

Intriguingly, p21 is oftenoverexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcino-mas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix[10-13]. Together these observations suggest that the roleplayed by p21 in cancer is more complex than initiallythought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycleregulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles inpromoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps inthe metastatic process and are regulated by numeroustumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microen-vironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracel-lular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cellmigration and invasion [14]. Among these tumor-secretedfactors, TGFb has been shown to play a pivotal role inpromoting tumor metastasis [15]. The TGFb family regu-lates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determinationduring embryogenesis and exerts profound effects onreproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth,bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughoutadult life [16]. The effects of TGFb in breast cancer arecomplex. TGFb is thought to play a dual role in breastcancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in nor-mal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor inaggressive carcinoma [17]. The growth inhibitory effects ofTGFb are known to be mediated through transcriptionalrepression of the c-myc gene [18] and induction of the cellcycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1arrest [19,20]. During tumor progression, however, theloss of TGFb growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due todefects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGFb [18]. Mean-while, other TGFb responses prevail, unrelated to growthinhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis[21-25]. Indeed, TGFb induces degradation of the ECM,inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration andinvasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis [21-23,25].Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secreteincreasing quantities of TGFb, which in turn alter thestroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumorangiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosup-pression, thus further contributing to tumor progressionand metastasis [21-23,25]. Together these studies highlightan important role for TGFb in advanced breast cancer.However, the function for p21 downstream of TGFb hasnot been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression corre-lates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Theexpression of p21 is required to promote tumor cellmigration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo.Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated byTGFb/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like tri-ple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 tophysically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyl-transferase p/CAF in response to TGFb and identifiedp21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGFb-mediatedbreast cancer cell migration and invasion. We alsoshowed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGFb transcrip-tional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genesby controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancyon its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemicalanalysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patientsrevealed a significant correlation between active TGFb/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carci-nomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAFas critical regulators of cell migration and invasion down-stream of TGFb/Smad3 pathway in advanced breastcancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cellswere grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetalbovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5%CO2.

After two days,25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added toeach well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5lof dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each welland mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was mea-sured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGFb for 0, 2, 6 and24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol over-night, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stainedwith 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotech-nology). DNA content was determined using a FACScanflow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated inEssen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, AnnArbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use ofImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos ofthe wound are automatically taken at the exact same loca-tion by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cellswere then serum-starved for six hours and confluent celllayers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker togenerate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. Afterwounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and sti-mulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml ofTGFb. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed intoIncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics:wound width, wound confluence or relative wound densityautomatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced(GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilledH2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell inva-sion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incu-bated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded onTranswell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in theupper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/mlTGFb for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers con-tained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PTcells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM\u2019S med-ium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upperchamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invadedthrough GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formalde-hyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystalviolet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells werephotographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscopeand total cell numbers were counted and quantified byImage J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda,Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimu-lated or not with TGFb overnight. Cells were then fixedwith 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilizedin 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS andblocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubatedwith anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS andincubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for onehour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00aeGold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocalanalysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axio-vert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarrayslides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinizedand rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1(Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mMcitrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes.The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistrystaining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19,Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam),phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DABPlus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detec-tion of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides werethen counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Labora-tories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated andmounted for microscopic examination. All images werescanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA,USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a patholo-gist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 wasscored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25%tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cellsstained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moder-ately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21were examined by the Pearson correlation test usingSPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associationsbetween these protein expressions and lymph node statuswere assessed by Fisher\u2019s exact test. P-value (two-sided)<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Dai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127Page 4 of 22Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice wereobtained from Charles River (Charles River LaboratoriesInternational, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as amodel for primary mammary tumor formation and localinvasion. The animal study was approved by the ethicscommittee and all the experimental animal protocols werein accordance with the McGill University Animal Care.Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail ofketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and aceproma-zine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, par-ental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) witha 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor sizewas measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volumewas determined according to the formula: tumor volume= shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice(eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injec-tion to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At theend of these studies, mammary tumors with surroundingfat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered for-malin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor wereembedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International,Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sectionswere stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of thetumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the lefttibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice weremonitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiographyof the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor thedevelopment of skeletal lesions at four, six and eightweeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system(Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8,radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and theosteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described[30]. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, nolesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significantlesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bonesurface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major breakin peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent\u2019s t-test was used and differences betweengroups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breastcancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expressionof cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis inbreast carcinomas [31-33]. To further explore the corre-lation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcomein breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently pub-lished gene profiling database of breast cancer patientsto assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS)and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes[34]. We analyzed the prognostic value according to themedian, upper and lower quartile expression levels ofp21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) andDMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (leftpanels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlatedwith poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7;1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17;0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levelsshowed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P =0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metas-tasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and abetter survival rate. Although the prediction did notshow statistically significant results in the medianexpression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR,1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical signifi-cance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed therelationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes inboth estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest inpatients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status(Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannotrule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found inthe stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, thesedata demonstrate that high p21 expression correlateswith poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevatedp21 expression may play a role in promoting tumorprogression.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivoand cancer cell migration and invasion in vitroTo investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formationand progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-meta-static cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triplenegative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred toas MDA) cells [35]. We first assessed the effect of suppres-sing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xeno-graft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stablytransfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells.Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells(Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells wereorthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad offemale Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumorgrowth was monitored weekly.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127Page 7 of 22depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for earlytumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with theoverlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzedby a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed bydetermining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to thesurrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tis-sue), as previously described [36]. As shown in Figure 2C(left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group dis-played no clear margin with the surrounding tissues andwere deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast,tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumormass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays animportant role in tumor invasion. This was confirmedin vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibitedboth cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E,respectively).As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of theanimals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells(eight per group) were injected into the mammary fatpad developed any bone lesions after two months, thedate at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumorsize. This timing may have been insufficient for tumorcells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse[37]. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in thelater stage of breast cancer progression, we examined itsinvolvement in the development of bone osteolyticlesions using an intratibia injection model of parentaland p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice.By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experi-mental model allows for the assessment of tumor cellmetastasis and survival in the bone marrow [38]. Asshown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), followingX-ray examination of the bones, both groups of micedeveloped secondary tumors that caused severe osteolyticbone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the laterstages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indi-cate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells toacquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted tothe earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely inductionof local cell invasion from the tumor to the surroundingtissues.TGFb induces p21 expression in migratory and invasivehuman breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signalingpathways [7]. Among these and of particular interest isthe TGFb/Smad signaling pathway [15,25,39]. Therefore,we examined the effect of TGFb on the expression levelsof p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breastcancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarci-noma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25)[40], an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafterreferred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with ana-plastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carci-noma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derivedSUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived frommetastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal car-cinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315) [41]. As shown inFigure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGFbstrongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in thesecell lines. Interestingly, TGFb showed no regulatoryeffect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regula-tory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistentwith a loss of the TGFb growth inhibitory responses inthese cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhi-bitor, the TGFb-induced increases in p21 protein levelsdid not translate into growth inhibition by TGFb (Addi-tional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest inthese breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investi-gated the mechanisms by which TGFb regulates p21 pro-tein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGFb type Ireceptor (TbRI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGFb-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGFbregulation of p21 expression is mediated through theTGFb receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we foundthis effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, asTGFb induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 andSmad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable toinduce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted ofSmad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, thesedata indicate that TGFb potently induces p21 expressionin a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cellgrowth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.p21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cellmigrationTGFb is an important modulator of cell motility in breastcancer [25,42]. Thus, we investigated whether p21 couldact downstream of TGFb to promote cell migration. Wefirst examined the effect of TGFb on cell migrationdynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupledto quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122).Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics:wound width, wound confluence and relative wound den-sity, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A,B, TGFb potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2and SUM149. As a negative control, we also usedSUM1315 in which TGFb did not regulate p21 expression.As expected, there was no effect of TGFb on cell migra-tion in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGFb-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expressionusing two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed theeffect of TGFb on cell migration dynamics by thescratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C,Dai et al.

The effect ofp21 siRNAs on TGFb-induced cell migration was similarto that observed when cells were transfected with asiRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control(Figure 4D, E).

These resultsdemonstrate that TGFb-mediated migration of humanbreast cancer cells is dependent on TGFb-induced p21expression.p21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cellinvasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGFb-induced tumor cellinvasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a ScrsiRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasivepotential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-MatrigelTranswell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock andScr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGFb signifi-cantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel andthis effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21.Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA onTGFb-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effectof the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of thep21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cellsin which endogenous p21 expression was silencedwere transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA(Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level(Figure 5C) as well as TGFb-induced cell invasion throughthe GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effectis specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limita-tion of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed thepro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressingor blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did notalter their growth in response to TGFb (Additional file 6,Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we foundSUM159 to be highly responsive to TGFb-induced cellinvasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, theTGFb pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpres-sion of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what wasobserved in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate thatTGFb-mediated migration and invasion of human breastcancer cells are dependent on TGFb-induced p21 expres-sion. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGFbsignaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serumand EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, FigureS6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatoryrole in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain thestrong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cellinvasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGFb-inducedtranscriptional activity and downstream genes involved incell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regu-lates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibitingROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migra-tion in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells [43,44].Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and totalprotein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cellsin response to TGFb. As shown in Figure S7A (Addi-tional file 8), TGFb has no effect on the phosphorylationof cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulatecofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 underthe stimulation of TGFb. Treatment with TGFb causedaccumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependentmanner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGFb-inducedand p21-driven cell migration and invasion in humanbreast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cellcycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interactwith multiple transcription factors [7] to selectively inhi-bit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in dis-tinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair,survival and ECM components [45]. Thus, we investi-gated whether p21 could interact with the Smad pro-teins to regulate the TGFb pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipita-tion studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfectedwith myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown inFigure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-inducedassociation between Smad2 and p21, we found TGFb toclearly induce complex formation between Smad3 andp21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of thep21/Smad3 interaction on TGFb signaling, we thenexamined the effect of p21 on TGFb-induced Smad3activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knockingdown p21 did not affect TGFb-induced Smad3 phos-phorylation. However, using a TGFb/Smad transcrip-tional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found thatp21 is required for TGFb-induced Smad transcriptionalactivity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silen-cing abolished TGFb-induced luciferase activity of theSmad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-lucactivity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overex-pressing p21 in response to TGFb. These results indi-cate that TGFb induces a complex formation betweenp21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect theearlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphoryla-tion), it is required for TGFb-mediated Smad transcrip-tional activity.We next performed gene profiling experiments in par-ental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transientlytransfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimumof two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiplep21-dependent TGFb target genes, among which wereselected those known to be associated with the tumormetastasis process. This shortlist included five candidatetarget genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8),Dai et al.

The mRNA levels ofindicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).Dai et al.

To confirm that these genes were TGFbdownstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were sti-mulated or not with TGFb and mRNA levels for thesetarget genes were analyzed by quantitative real-timePCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGFb signifi-cantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2,PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in bothcell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptionalregulation of these genes by TGFb, we examined theeffects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressingp21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A,knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGFbtranscriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 andPTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGFb to induceexpression of these target genes. The same results wereobtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data notshown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in thesecell lines potentiated the TGFb transcriptional effects onthese target genes. As a negative control and to ensurespecificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect ofsilencing p21 on the TGFb-mediated increase in trans-forming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA.TGFb regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21(Figure 7B).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGFb target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced theirgene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown inFigure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impairedTGFb-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. Whiledepletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antago-nized the TGFb response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examina-tion of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicatedthat IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggest-ing that they may be specifically required for the TGFbpro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition ofMMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasionsuggesting that these target genes have a broader effecton cell invasion, not limited to the TGFb signaling path-way. Together, these results indicate that even though allfive genes are important for TGFb signaling leading tocell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predomi-nant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGFb transcriptional activity andSmad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcrip-tion by associating with various transcription factors [7],but also regulates estrogen receptor-a-dependent geneexpression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP)[47,48]. Gene transcription downstream of TGFb signal-ing is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a memberof another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases [49-52]. Thus, we examined whetherp21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF inresponse to TGFb. Interestingly, we found that whileTGFb did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancercells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly bindsto Smad3 [50]. As we have shown that TGFb inducescomplex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A),we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is alsorequired for Smad3 association with p21. For this,HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA toblock expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown inFigure 8B, TGFb induced complex formation betweenp21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly,depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interac-tion, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required forSmad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regu-lation of p21-dependent TGFb downstream target genes,SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-taggedp21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAFsiRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured toverify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR(Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated inductionof IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGFb. However, theseeffects were significantly blocked when p/CAF geneexpression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is requiredfor p21-dependent gene expression of the TGFb targets(Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream ofTGFb was further investigated using the Transwell Matri-gel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAFgene expression significantly impaired TGFb-induced cellinvasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Westernblotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene tran-scription by acetylating histones and transcription factors[49], we then assessed whether TGFb could induce globalchanges in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. Forthis, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells,treated or not with TGFb and subjected to immunoblot-ting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig-ure S8 (Additional file 9), TGFb had no effect on globalhistone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhi-bitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels.This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAFrecruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be moreDai et al.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127Page 16 of 22directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather thanglobal histone modifications. To address this, we examinedwhether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads.Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interact-ing with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acety-lation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, theacetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did notshow any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data notshown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to berequired for its DNA binding activity [51]. Thus, this ledus to investigate whether p/CAF could associate withDNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNAIP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad bind-ing element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in theFigure 8H, we found TGFb to specifically induce bindingof both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, wefound that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siR-NAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I),suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required forSmad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptionalactivity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required forSmad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), wethen assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF onSmad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-lucreporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the resultsclearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGFb-inducedSmad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF reg-ulate TGFb transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGFb induces acomplex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF,further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Further-more, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNAbinding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity,highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGFb tar-get gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associatedwith lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognosticindicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes [53]. Highexpression of TGFb1 is correlated with a high incidenceof lymph node metastasis [54]. To examine the associa-tion among active TGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immu-nohistochemistry to measure the expression levels ofserine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasiveductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node posi-tive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAFprotein expression in tumor cells was graded anddescribed in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. Asshown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patientsshowed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expres-sions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3(68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed inpatients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P =0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguishbetween tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratinantibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplasticcells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Addi-tional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higherlevel in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. Wealso examined the relationships between pSmad3 levelsand p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels,using the Pearson\u2019s correlation test. As shown in Figure9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phos-phorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantlycorrelate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively,these data indicate that active TGFb/Smad3 signaling isassociated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expressionlevels and significantly correlates with lymph nodemetastasis in breast cancer.DiscussionWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cellcycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmicp21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatoryfunctions [27,43,55]. The accumulation of cytoplasmicp21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activatedtumorigenic transformation [32,44]. Moreover, overex-pression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis ofmany types of cancer. However, the function of p21 inbreast cancer has not been established. In our study, weassessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast can-cer patients. High p21 expression correlates with pooroverall survival and distant metastasis free survival.Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat padtransplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cellsin mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expres-sion did not affect the primary tumor formation, itpotently prevented primary tumor cells to invade intosurrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evi-dence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primarytumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast can-cer progression, TGFb cytostatic responses are lost whilepro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained[56]. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer celllines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGFband that while TGFb did not induce any change in p15or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This isin contrast to the effect observed in human immortalizedDai et al.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127Page 19 of 22a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancerprogression.We further report that the TGFb-mediated increasein p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 spe-cific. This is interesting in light of previous reportsindicating that overexpression of a dominant negativeform of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells tometastasize [57] and that Smad3, but not Smad2, pro-motes breast cancer metastasis in mice [58]. Further-more, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have beendescribed, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yetbeen reported. Together these data suggest that inbreast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions aremediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may proveuseful to improve the clinical course of metastaticpatients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiationsteps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It hasbeen suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; how-ever, we found that TGFb had no effect on regulatingcofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, weidentified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regu-lation of TGFb/Smad3 signaling through the interactionof p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. Theinteraction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-depen-dent, but whether this interaction is direct will requirefurther investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 oncell migration and invasion are mediated through inter-actions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulateSmad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptionalactivity, as well as gene transcription of several TGFbpro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interest-ing to further investigate whether p21 is selective for thepro-oncogenic activity of TGFb or whether it is alsorequired for the transcriptional regulation of other typesof TGFb responses and target genes. Taken together, ourresults demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcrip-tional target of TGFb and a co-stimulatory factor ofSmad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast can-cer cells (Figure 10).Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGFb-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. Theprognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clini-cal and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph nodemetastasis is one of the most important prognostic para-meters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is asharp difference in survival rate between patients withpositive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, wefound a significant association of active TGFb/Smad3 sig-naling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node posi-tivity, making them potential useful prognosis markersfor lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for thecell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. Highexpression of p21 positively correlated with poor overalland distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breastcancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstreamregulator of TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migrationand invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 andthe acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smadtranscriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of sev-eral TGFb-induced pro-metastatic genes. These resultshighlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGFb-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at thetranscriptional level.Additional materialAdditional file 1: Table S1: Patient characteristics from breastcarcinoma microarray tissue sections.
