EA (10 or 30mg/kg/day, intragastrically) was administered for 14 consecutive days, andactivity, protein, and mRNA levels were determined. Although the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B and CYP2E enzyme activitieswere decreased significantly, the activities of all other enzymes were unchanged with the 10mg/kg/day EA. In addition, western-blot and qRT-PCR results clearly corroborated the above enzyme expressions. On the other hand, while the NAD(P)H:quinoneoxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities wereincreased significantly, CYP1A, 2B, 2C, 2E, and 19 enzyme activities were reduced significantly with 30mg/kg/day EA. In addition,CYP2B, 2C6, 2E1, and 19 protein and mRNA levels were substantially decreased by the 30mg/kg/day dose of EA, but the CYP1Aprotein, and mRNA levels were not changed. CYP3A enzyme activity, protein and mRNA levels were not altered by neither 10 nor30mg/kg/day ellagic acid.These results indicate that EA exerts a dose-dependent impact on themetabolismof chemical carcinogensand drugs by affecting the enzymes involved in xenobiotics activation/detoxification and antioxidant pathways.1. IntroductionEllagic acid (EA) is one of the important components offruits and vegetables [1] and has been shown to possessnumerous anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic propertiestowards various carcinogens [1\u20137]. Several mechanisms havebeen proposed to explain the broad antimutagenic andanticarcinogenic effects of EA [8\u201313]. One of the mech-anisms proposed involves inhibition of cytochrome P450(CYP450) enzymes [8]. CYP450 enzymes are widely knownfor their role in the metabolism of drugs and other foreigncompounds. Thus, modulation of this enzyme system caninfluence the metabolism of xenobiotics, producing effectsof pharmacological and toxicological importance. A numberof naturally occurring flavonoids have been shown to mod-ulate the CYP450 system by the activation or inhibition ofthese enzymes [14]. Multiple P450 isozymes show differentsubstrate specificities and affinities toward both endogenousand exogenous compounds. Among these P450s, CYP1A, 2B,2C, 2E, and 3A subfamilies have received a great deal ofattention in recent years because of their ability to metabolizevarious pharmaceutical and carcinogenic agents [15\u201317]. Itis well established that CYP1A and CYP2E enzymes aremainly involved in carcinogen metabolism while CYP3A,CYP2B, and CYP2C enzymes aremainly responsible for drugmetabolism.Aromatase represents a crucial enzyme of estrogenbiosynthesis, and increased expression of aromatase hasbeen observed in breast cancer tissue [18]. Flavonoids andisoflavones are structurally similar to the endogenous estra-diol and possess both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activitieshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/3589452 BioMed Research International[19]. Previous studies suggest that ellagic acid has potential forthe prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancers [20, 21].Another possible mechanism for the broad chemopro-tective and antioxidant effects of EA might involve theinduction of phase II and antioxidant enzymes. GSTs have aconsiderably important role in the detoxification of carcino-gens [22]. NQO1 prevents quinine redox cycling and lowerslevels of electrophilic quinines [23]. Hence, the inductions ofGST and NQO1 by flavonoids are possibly associated withcancer chemopreventive effects. The present study is, to ourknowledge, the first study analyzing the effect of EA onNQO1activity, mRNA, and protein levels in rat.Although there are individual studies examining theeffect of EA on several enzymes, no study has evaluated thealteration of so many enzymes simultaneously with differentdose of EA. Therefore, the present study was undertaken toobserve the overall simultaneous changes following in vivotreatment with different dose of EA by investigating changesin the activity,mRNA, andprotein levels of specific rat hepaticP450s, phase II, and antioxidant enzymes at once.2. Material and Methods2.1. Chemicals. The following chemicals were purchasedfrom Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St Louis, Mis-souri, USA): ellagic acid, acrylamide, aniline, anti-rabbitIgG-HRP conjugate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Folinphenol reagent, glycerol, glycine, HEPES, \ud835\udefd-NADPH, phe-nol, caffeine, TRIS, PMSF, potassium dihydrogen phosphate,dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS), and sodium potassium tartrate. Anti-rat CYP1A1,CYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, and CYP19 antibodieswere from Abcam (Abcam PLC, Cambridge, UK). All otherchemicals and solvents were obtained from commercialsources at the highest grade of purity available.2.2. Animals and Treatment. Healthy maleWistar rats, about12 weeks old andweighing 200\u2013250 g, were obtained from theUniversity Animal House.They were housed in small cages atan ambient temperature of 22\u00b11\u2218C, on a 12 h light/dark cycle,and a standard pellet diet and distilled water were availablewithout restriction. All experimental procedures with theanimals were performed under appropriate regimes with vet-erinary services within the licensed projects (PAUHADEK-2009-007).After being acclimatized for 1 week, the rats were ran-domized and divided into three groups. Ellagic acid wasgiven intragastrically to two experimental groups (15 rats pergroup) in a dose of 10mg/kg/day (T10) and 30mg/kg/day(T30) dissolved in DMSO, respectively. Control (15 rats)rats only received a vehicle (DMSO). The doses used werechosen to be similar to the doses used in previous studiesin the literature [24\u201326]. The animals were treated for 14consecutive days. At the end of the experimental periodand following 16 h of fasting, blood was collected by heartpuncture and the rats were killed; the livers were removed,rinsed with cold physiological saline, and stored at \u221280\u2218Cuntil analyzed.2.3. Preparations of S1.5, Cytosolic, and Microsomal Frac-tion. Tissues were homogenized in a 4 part homogeniza-tion solution (1.15% KCl containing 3mM EDTA, 0.5mMAPMSF, 0.3mM \ud835\udf00-aminocaproic acid, 0.15mM butylatedhydroxytoluene, and 0.025% Triton X-100) using a tissuehomogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 4\u2218C. Subcellular fractions(S1.5, cytosolic, microsomal) of rat tissues were prepared bystandard differential centrifugation with calcium aggregationas described by [27]. The amount of protein in individualfractions was measured using BCA [28] with BSA as thestandard.2.4. Enzyme Assays. Serum aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activitieswere determined with an autoanalyzer using audit di-agnostics AST and ALT. The microsomal cytochromeP450-dependent aniline 4-hydroxylase (A4H) activitiesof rat microsomes were determined by measuring thequantity of p-aminophenol formed, as described by [29].Aminopyrene N-demethylase (APND), erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) and caffeine N-demethylase (C3ND),n-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase (NDMA), ethyl-morphine N-demethylase (EmND), and benzphetamineN-demethylase (BPND) activities were determined bymeasuring the quantity of formaldehyde formed, accordingto the method of [30] and modified by [31]. EthoxyresorufinO-deethylase (EROD), and methoxyresorufin O-demethyl-ase (MROD), benzyloxyresorufin O-demethylase (BROD),pentoxyresorufin O-demethylase (PROD) activities wereassayed as described by [15]. Dibenzylfluorescein-O-debenzylase (DBFOD) activities were assayed as describedby [32]. Rat liver NQO1 enzyme activity was determinedaccording to the method of [33]. Glutathione S-transferase(GST) activities were assayed as described by [34]. Catalase(CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities weredetermined by [35, 36], respectively.2.5. Gel Electrophoresis andWestern Blotting. SDS-PAGE andwestern blotting were performed as described previously[15]. Briefly, 120\ud835\udf07g protein samples were separated on 8.5%polyacrylamide gels using the discontinuous buffer systemof [37]. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose mem-brane by the iBlot dry blotting system (20V, 12min), usingiBlot gel transfer stacks. Following transfer, the membraneswere blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20mMTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400mM NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween20)for 60min, and incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-ratCYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, or CYP19antibodies (diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking solution) for 120minat room temperature.Themembranes were then washed withTBST (3 \u00d7 5min), incubated with the secondary antibody(HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a 1 : 5000 or 1 : 10000dilution) for 60min and again washed with TBST (3 \u00d75min). Proteins were detected using SuperSignal West PicoChemoluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA),and bands were visualized and recorded using GelQuantImage Analysis Software in a DNR LightBIS Pro ImageAnalysis System (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Jerusalem,BioMed Research International 356 kDa Control1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1056 kDa56 kDa10 mg/kgEAT30 mg/kgEATGAPDH(a)020406080100120CYP1A protein CYP1A mRNARelative protein concentration (a.u.)

Protein bands were quantified using Scion ImageVersion Beta 4.0.2 software.2.6. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR of CYP mRNAs. Total RNAwas extracted from 100mg rat livers using TRIzol reagent.Extracted RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at260/280 nm, and the integrity was checked using 1% agarosegel. For cDNA synthesis, 2.5 \ud835\udf07g of RNAwas incubated at 70\u2218Cfor 10 minutes with 0.5\ud835\udf07g of oligo (dT). After 5min on ice,50U Moloney murine leukemia virus reverses transcriptase,1mM dNTPs and 5X reaction buffer were added to theprevious mixture and incubated at 42\u2218C for 60min. Thereaction was stopped by heating the mixture to 70\u2218C for10min, and the cDNA was stored at \u221280\u2218C for further use.qRT-PCR assay was performed by using gene specificprimers. The oligosequences used as forward and reverseTable 1: Blood serumAST andALT enzyme activities in control andEA-treated rats.ASTChangefoldASTChangefoldUnit/min/mgproteinUnit/min/mgproteinControl 1.53 \u00b1 0.12 \u2014 1.33 \u00b1 0.19 \u201410mg/kg EA 1.55 \u00b1 0.16 \u2014 1.38 \u00b1 0.21 \u201430mg/kg EA 1.54 \u00b1 0.21 \u2014 1.34 \u00b1 0.12 \u2014primers for rat CYP450 isozymes were based on thosereported in [38, 39]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase (GAPDH) and \ud835\udefd-actin were used as a housekeepinggene. The PCR amplification was done using Power SYBRGreen PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Basel,Switzerland) and 500 nmol/L of forward and reverse primersfor each gene, for which the final primer concentrationwas 125 nmol/L each. Quantitative PCR was done using aLight Cycler 1.5 Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Basel,Switzerland). The PCR conditions were as follows: DNApolymerase activation at 95\u2218C for 15 minutes, followed by 45cycles at 95\u2218C for 10 seconds, 54\u201357\u2218C annealing (dependingon the gene) for 5 seconds, and 72\u2218C for 30 seconds. All geneanalyses were done at least three times.2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performedusing the Minitab 13 statistical software package (Minitab,Inc., State College, PA, USA). All results were expressedas means including their Standard Error of Means (SEMs).Comparison between groups was performed using Student\u2019st-test, and \ud835\udc43 < 0.05 was selected as the level requiredfor statistical significance. Statistical comparisons betweenthree groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance(ANOVA). When F ratios were significant (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05),one-way ANOVA was followed by Tukey\u2019s Post hoc test forcomparisons of multiple group means.3. ResultsControl and treated rats showed no significant differences infood consumption or body weight, (data not shown) afterintragastric delivery of the EA to the animals at two differentdoses (T10 and T30).As shown in Table 1, blood serumAST and ALT activitieswere not changed when compared to the control rats. Aspresented in Table 2, hepatic 1A1-associated EROD and 1A2-associatedMRODorC3NDactivities were decreased 11% and13% or 40% in T30 treated rats, respectively, when comparedto controls.The effect of the EA onCYP2B-associated BPND, EmND,BROD, and PROD activities is presented in Table 2. EAtreatment at T10 or T30 for 14 consecutive days caused astatistically significant (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) 13%, 10%, 15%, and 10% or55%, 38%, 23%, and 30% decrease in these activities in theliver, respectively.CYP2E-associated A4H and NDMA activities in controland EA-treated rats are given in Table 2.

Similarly, EA treatment at T10 reduced 28%and 26% with respect to the control.The effect of the EA on CYP2C6-associated APND,CYP3A-associated ERND, and CYP19-associated DBFODactivity is presented in Table 2. EA treatment at T30 causeda statistically significant 55%, 28%, and 24% decrease inCYP2C6, CYP3A, and CYP19 activities in the liver, respec-tively.GSTs activities in control and EA-treated rats are givenin Table 2. GST activities towards three different substrates,namely, CDNB, DCNB, and EA were increased 49%, 42%,and 33% (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) in the T30 treated group. Furthermore,treatment of rats with T30 dose caused 194%, 64%, and 114%increases in NQO1, CAT, and GPX activities, respectively,when compared to the control values (Table 2).The activation of catalytic activities was generally consis-tent with the protein levels of related CYP isoforms in rat livermicrosomes that were prepared from control and EA-treatedrats (Figures 1\u20136). The densitometric scanning of westernblot results showed that hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A were notsignificantly changed in the T10 or T30 treated rats relative tothe control animals (Figures 1 and 5).The densitometric scanning of western blot resultsshowed that hepatic CYP2B protein level was decreased 51%and 38% as a result of two different doses of EA treatments.Moreover, T10 and T30 treatments caused a 53% and 32%reduction of the CYP2E protein level (Figures 2 and 4).Although CYP2C and CYP19 protein levels were reducedwith T30 treatment, it was not at a significant level (Figures 3and 6).The effect of EA on themRNA levels of CYP isozymeswasalso determined throughout in this study.The relative CYP1Aand CYP3A mRNA levels were not changed significantlyin the EA-treated rats as compared to the control animals(Figures 1 and 5). CYP2E level was decreased significantly79% and 31% in T10 and T30 treated rats, respectively(Figure 4). In addition, CYP2B level was reduced 76% and39% as a result of two different doses of EA-treated ratsrelative to the controls (Figure 2). CYP2C level was decreased49% significantly in EA-treated rats at T30, respectively(Figure 3). Similar to the changes at protein level, CYP19mRNA was decreased but not significantly (Figure 6).4. DiscussionAlterations in the cellular metabolism of xenobiotics arethe most important mechanisms that play a vital role dur-ing chemical-induced carcinogenicity. Therefore, the use ofdietary antioxidants is an important preventive method tominimize the pathological and toxic effects associated withxenobiotics [8, 10, 14]. In this context, this study is carried outto examine the dose-dependent effects of EA on specific P450forms and also on selected phase II and antioxidant enzymesin rat liver.Plasma AST and ALT, alone or in combination, areprimarily recommended for the assessment of hepatocellularinjury in rodents and nonrodents in nonclinical studies.Theyare sensitive markers for drug-induced liver damage, andthe elevated activities of these marker enzymes in plasmaare indicative of cellular leakage and loss of the functionalintegrity of cell membranes in the liver [40]. Treatment withEA at different doses (T10 and T30) caused no changes in theactivities of these marker enzymes in plasma when comparedwith the control group. Therefore, EA, at these doses, can beused in preventive or complementary medicine with safetyprecautions and within the scope of the methods employedin public health.BioMed Research International 556 kDa Control1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1056 kDa56 kDa10 mg/kgEAT30 mg/kgEATGAPDH(a)020406080100120CYP2B protein CYP2B mRNARelative protein concentration (a.u.)

This CYP is theprimary P450 involved in the conversion of outstandingcarcinogens to the electrophilic metabolites and is knownto be induced by its substrates such as benzopyrene. Inthis study, CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,EROD, MROD, and C3ND were all decreased as a resultof T30 treatment, consistent with the previous findingsof [41]. Although EA treatment resulted in a significantreduction in CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,hepatic CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels were found notto be changed with EA treatments. EA inhibited CYP1Aenzymes directly, without an alteration of its gene and proteinexpression, and the in vivo effect depends to a great degreeon the concentration of this compound in rat liver.

Consistent withprotein levels, administration of the EA had also decreasedthe CYP2E1 mRNA level. Since the regulation of CYP2E1expression is complex, involving transcriptional, posttran-scriptional, and posttranslational events with polymorphismplaying a role [45], the observed mRNA decrease resultingfrom EA treatment could be either transcriptional or post-transcriptional, which remains to be elucidated. Hence, nomatter what the mechanism is, EA administration mightdecrease the carcinogenesis by inhibiting CYP2E1 and reducereactive oxygen species by affecting the metabolic pathwaysof alcohol.Cytochrome 2B, 2C, and 3A enzymes participate in awide array of metabolism of drugs.

Moreover, CYP2C-associated APND activitywas decreased significantly with T30 dose of EA. Also,CYP2C protein and mRNA level were decreased with thesame dose. Similarly, EA-treatment caused inhibitory effectin CYP3A-associated ERND activity in rat liver microsomes.As previously shown with CYP3A or CYP2C activities [46,47], EA, which is an antioxidant found in large quantitiesin pomegranate juice, displayed a probably nonmechanism-based inhibitory effect for CYP3A andCYP2C activities in ratliver microsomes. Thus, drug interactions are fairly likely tooccur if EA supplements are taken simultaneouslywith drugs.The aromatase enzyme, which converts androgen toestrogen, plays a key role particularly in breast carcinogenesis.CYP19-associated enzyme activities, DBFOD,were decreasedBioMed Research International 758 kDa Control1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1058 kDa58 kDa10 mg/kgEAT30 mg/kgEATGAPDH(a)020406080100120CYP19 protein CYP19 mRNARelative protein concentration (a.u.)

In addition, CYP19 protein andmRNA levels were reduced with T30 to a lesser extent thanthe activities. Therefore, the observed inhibition resultingfrom EA treatment could be neither transcriptional nortranslational and remains to be elucidated. Taken togetherwith the results of previous reports [20] and the results of thecurrent study, it may be suggested that EA intake may be aviable strategy for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.Some of the anticancer effects of dietary polyphenols arerelated, at least partly, to their indirect antioxidant activities[48\u201351]. For example, the enhancement of GPX, catalase,NQO1, GSTs, and/or phase II enzyme activities by polyphe-nols could help the detoxification of carcinogenic agents.Hence, the induction of these enzyme activities by flavonoidsis possibly associated with cancer chemopreventive effects.In this study, EA treatment caused an increase in GSTs,NQO1, GPX, and CAT activities in rat liver microsomes.Similarly, the induction of liver GSTs, NQO1, and CATenzyme activities by flavonoids such as genistein, daidzein,flavone, rutin, quercitrin, myricetin, and kaempferol wasreported in recent studies [52\u201356]. These observations maybe of importance in view of the potential use of EA both aspotent anticancer agents as well as chemopreventive agents.5. ConclusionIn this study, the different doses of EA did not produce thesame effects. While the lower dose of EA (10mg/kg/day) wasnot effective because its concentration might not have beenenough to reach to the site of action and quench all freeradicals generated, the higher dose of EA (30mg/kg/day)was good enough to be effective. In conclusion, the dose-dependent suppression of CYP1A, CYP2E, and CYP19 andthe induction of GSTs, NQO1, GPX, and CAT enzymessuggest anticancer as well as chemopreventive roles for EAwhile reductions in CYP2B, 2C, and 3A explain potentialdrug interactions.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Scientific and TechnologicalResearch Council of Turkey [109R012] and Pamukkale Uni-versity [2010FBE081].
