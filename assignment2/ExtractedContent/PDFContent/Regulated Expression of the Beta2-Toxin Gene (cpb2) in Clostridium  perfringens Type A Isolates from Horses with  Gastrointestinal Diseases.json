These putative relationships, indicated by PCR genotyping, weretested in the present study by further genotyping and phenotyping of 23 cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolatesfrom horses with GI disease (referred to hereafter as horse GI disease isolates). Our beta2-toxin (CPB2)Western blot analyses demonstrated that all of the tested isolates were unable to produce detectable levels ofCPB2. However, Southern blot and nucleotide sequencing analyses identified intact cpb2 open reading framesin all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase PCR and Northern blotanalyses showed that cpb2 genes in all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates were transcriptionally active,i.e., an \ufffd1.2-kb cpb2-specific mRNA was identified in total RNA from our surveyed isolates. The levels of cpb2mRNA in CWC245 (a high-CPB2-producing pig strain) and our surveyed horse GI disease isolates differed tosuch an extent (35-fold) that this difference could be considered as a major cause of the difference in levels ofCPB2 production by CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates. This finding received further support from ourobservation that the complementing strain 106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels ofmRNA than strain 106902, produced high levels of CPB2. Collectively, our results indicated that there is apositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens celland that decreased transcription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in part, in the low CPB2production noted for horse GI disease isolates in comparison to that noted for pig GI disease isolate CWC245.Clostridium perfringens is an important cause of histotoxicand gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in both humans and animals(20, 26). The virulence of this bacterium results largely from itsability to produce at least 15 different toxins (21). C. perfringensisolates are commonly classified (21) into one of five types, Ato E, based upon their ability to produce the four major lethaltoxins (i.e., alpha-, beta-, epsilon-, and iota-toxins). The majorlethal toxins, however, are not the only biomedically importanttoxins; some C. perfringens isolates (mostly those belonging totype A) produce C. perfringens enterotoxin (20), and manyisolates of both types A and C produce beta2-toxin (CPB2) (5,9, 11, 29)The 28-kDa CPB2 was first purified from C. perfringens typeC strain CWC245 and shown to be cytotoxic for Chinese ham-ster ovary cells (15). Fisher et al. (9) recently demonstratedthat CPB2 produced by a non-food-borne human GI diseaseisolate is cytotoxic for CaCo-2 cells. Although cpb2 was initiallyidentified in C. perfringens type C isolates, a recent study (5)demonstrated the presence of cpb2 sequences in all types of C.perfringens. The deduced amino acid sequence of CPB2 ishighly conserved in type A and C strains of C. perfringensisolated from diarrheic pigs (11, 29). However, the variabilityin CPB2 sequences in type A human isolates (9) coupled withCPB2 sequence differences in isolates from nonporcine ani-mals (16) indicate that CPB2 is an unusual C. perfringens toxin.Several epidemiological studies suggested that cpb2-positiveC. perfringens isolates are highly associated with enteric dis-eases in domestic animals, particularly enteritis in piglets (10,11, 18), typhlocolitis in horses (2, 13), diarrhea in dogs (27),ulcerative enteritis in an African elephant (1), and enterotox-emia in calves (19). These putative associations between cpb2-positive isolates and GI diseases in animals remained tentativebecause this conclusion was drawn on the basis of PCR geno-typing, in which only the presence of cpb2 sequences and notthe expression of cpb2 was demonstrated. Although a recentstudy (29), by demonstrating that all of the surveyed cpb2-positive isolates from pigs with GI disease (referred to here-after as pig GI disease isolates) can, in fact, produce CPB2,confirmed the association of cpb2-positive isolates with GIdiseases in piglets, no such evidence with a large number ofclinical isolates has been provided in favor of an association ofcpb2-positive isolates with GI diseases in nonporcine animals.Even though a recent study (5) demonstrated the productionof CPB2 in 100% (n \ufffd 2), 50% (n \ufffd 10), and 40% (n \ufffd 5) ofthe surveyed horse, bovine, and avian GI disease isolates, re-spectively, the correlation between PCR genotype and CPB2production in horse GI disease isolates still remained quitetentative due to the minute surveyed population.The putative associations thus noted between cpb2-positiveisolates and CPB2-associated horse GI diseases clearly requireverification by analyzing larger numbers of horse GI disease* Corresponding author.

In response to this issue, our present study has per-formed the first in-depth molecular genetic and phenotypicanalysis of a large number of European cpb2-positive C. per-fringens type A isolates obtained from horses with GI diseases.Results from the present study indicate that there is a positivecorrelation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amountof CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that decreasedtranscription and/or message instability may be involved, atleast in part, in the low cpb2 expression levels observed inhorse isolates compared to the level in pig isolate CWC245.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains. The C. perfringens isolates used in this study are listed anddescribed in Table 1. The cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolatesused in this study were identified earlier by multiplex PCR analysis (10, 13) ascpe-negative type A isolates. In this study, by using the reverse CAMP test (12),we reconfirmed that all cpb2-positive type A isolates surveyed in this studyproduced (data not shown) the arrow-shaped zone of synergistic hemolysis in-dicative of alpha-toxin expression.Growth conditions. A starter culture (6 ml) of each C. perfringens isolate wasprepared by overnight growth at 37\u00b0C in fluid thioglycolate broth (Difco) asdescribed previously (8). For DNA and RNA isolation or culture supernatantprotein preparation, an aliquot (0.2 ml) of each fluid thioglycolate broth culturewas inoculated into 10 ml of TGY broth (3% Trypticase, 2% glucose, 1% yeastextract, 0.1% cysteine [8]), which was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 to 24 h withoutshaking. (Note that, because of moderate aerotolerance, C. perfringens can growin liquid medium without anaerobic incubation). For selection of C. perfringenstransformants carrying pMRS140, C. perfringens cultures were plated onto abrain heart infusion agar plate containing erythromycin (50 \ufffdg/ml) and incu-bated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h in an anaerobic jar with BBL GasPak (Becton Dickinsonand Company).Protein preparations and Western blot analysis. Culture supernatant fluid wasseparated by centrifugation at 500 \ufffd g from 20-ml TGY cultures of C. perfringensisolates grown for 18 h at 37\u00b0C. This culture supernatant fluid was used to isolatesupernatant proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation (29) or to concentrateto 20-fold at 4\u00b0C using Amicon Centricon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Mil-lipore). Total cell protein was prepared from the bacterial pellet of a 20-ml TGYculture which was used to prepare culture supernatant proteins as previouslydescribed (29). Prepared proteins were electrophoresed on a 0.1% sodium do-decyl sulfate\u201312% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Sequi-Blot polyvi-nylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and CPB2 Western blot analysis wasperformed as previously described (29).Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Southern blot anal-yses. A 318-bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cpb2-specific DNA probe was pre-pared by using a two-step PCR amplification method as previously described(29). Isolated C. perfringens DNA samples, prepared as previously described (8,23), were digested with EcoRV or HpaI (New England Biolabs), separated byelectrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and Southern transferred. The blots werehybridized with the DIG-labeled cpb2 probe, which was then detected using aDIG chemiluminescence detection system utilizing CSPD [disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2\ufffd-(5-chloro)tricyclo[3,3.1.13.7]decane}-4-yl)phenylphosphate] ready-to-use substrate (Roche) as described earlier (23).PFGE and Southern blot analyses. Cells from overnight TGY cultures werecollected by centrifugation and used to prepare agarose plugs containinggenomic C. perfringens DNA as previously described (4, 6, 7, 24, 25). The undi-gested total unsheared genomic DNA in 100 \ufffdl of an agarose plug was electro-phoresed at 200 V with a Bio-Rad CHEF-DRII apparatus, with a pulse rampedfrom 50 to 90 s over 20 h (24, 25). These pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)gels were then subjected to cpb2 Southern blot analysis using the same proceduredescribed above.Cloning and sequencing of the cpb2-containing fragment from various cpb2-positive isolates. A 1,373-bp DNA fragment carrying cpb2 open reading frame(ORF) and 262-bp upstream and 312-bp downstream sequences from each ofthree horse GI disease isolates (106902, 106903, and AHT3553) was PCR am-plified using primers 5\ufffd-GCTCTAGAGGATATCTTAAATTTAGCACAG-3\ufffdTABLE 1.

These PCR products were then cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPOvector using the TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen). Both strands of the cpb2-containing DNA insert, from two clones for each isolate, were then sequencedusing M13 forward and reverse primers.RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from TGY cultures of C. perfrin-gens strains as previously described (8, 14). The primer set 5\ufffd-AAACTGAATTTTTAAATGGTGC-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3\ufffd, which am-plified a 318-bp cpb2 internal fragment, was used to detect cpb2-specific mRNAin total RNA preparations by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis with thecommercially available Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). After RT-PCR, the pres-ence of an amplified product was analyzed by subjecting an aliquot of eachsample to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining andvisualization under UV illumination. The presence of an amplified product of theexpected size was indicative of the presence of specific mRNA transcripts in totalRNA preparations.Northern blot analysis. A 560-bp internal cpb2 DNA fragment was amplifiedfrom CWC245 by PCR using primer set 5\ufffd-GGAGCAATAAGTCCAATGAA-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3\ufffd and labeled with alkalinephosphatase using the Gene Images AlkPhos direct labeling and detection sys-tem (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA isolated from C. perfringens strainsgrown in TGY broth at 37\u00b0C for different time periods as previously described (8,14) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and Northern trans-ferred. The blots were hybridized with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled cpb2probe, and hybridized probe was then detected by CDPstar chemiluminescence(Amersham Biosciences). The relative levels of cpb2 mRNA in horse GI diseaseisolates were determined from a calibration curve, which was made using variousamounts (0.1 to 5 \ufffdg) of RNA prepared from high-CPB2-producing pig strainCWC245. The densitometric analysis was performed on a Macintosh computerusing the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. NationalInstitutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).Construction of complementing strains 106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140). A 1,373-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment was extracted from pMW1 andcloned into KpnI/SalI sites of pJIR751 (3). Plasmid pMW1, which is a derivativeof the pCR-XL-TOPO vector carrying the 106902 cpb2 ORF and its upstreamand downstream sequences, was constructed for nucleotide sequencing analysesas described above. The plasmid pMRS140 was introduced into C. perfringens106902 and 106903 electrocompetent cells by electroporation as previously de-scribed (8, 23).RESULTSCPB2 production by cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.Our collection of European horse GI disease isolates has beenpreviously identified (10, 13) as cpb2 positive by using a mul-tiplex PCR assay. Since a recent study (5) reported that only50% of nonporcine cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates canproduce CPB2, in this study we first evaluated whether ourcollection of European horse GI disease isolates positive forcpb2 by PCR (cpb2 PCR-positive isolates) could, in fact,produce CPB2. We first analyzed culture supernatant pro-teins from cpb2-positive C. perfringens. When CPB2 Westernblotting was performed with supernatant proteins from acontrol CPB2-producing C. perfringens pig isolate, CWC245(11), an \ufffd28-kDa immunoreactive band was obtained (Fig.1), consistent with previous reports (11, 29). However, noCPB2 production could be detected in the culture superna-tant of a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (data not shown).When similar CPB2 Western blot analyses were performedon culture supernatant proteins prepared from our unknown23 horse GI disease isolates, no CPB2-specific immunoreactiveband was detected (Table 1; representative results are shownin Fig. 1). To investigate whether this lack of CPB2 productionin our surveyed cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates was dueto impaired secretion of CPB2, we compared the production ofCPB2 in culture supernatant with that in total cell proteinpreparations (Fig. 1) using CPB2 Western blotting analysis.Again, no CPB2-specific immunoreactive band was observed inthe assays with either supernatant or total cell proteins of horseGI disease isolates (Fig. 1). These results suggested that all ofour surveyed horse GI disease isolates were incapable of pro-ducing detectable levels of CPB2.RFLP genotyping of cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates. Toevaluate whether CPB2 Western blotting-negative isolatesFIG. 1. Western blot analysis of CPB2 production by selected horse GI disease isolates.

Migration of the supernatant proteins is shown by arrows. (B) Western blot of the gel shown in panelA. The blot was probed with CPB2 antibodies and developed by chemiluminescent detection to identify immunoreactive species. Results shownfor control isolates include those for CWC245 (a cpb2-positive type C strain). Results shown for representative horse GI disease isolates includethose for isolates 106902 and 106903. Molecular mass markers are shown in the middle.4004 WATERS ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.were truly cpb2 positive, our collection of horse GI diseaseisolates was subjected to RFLP analysis. We first performedRFLP-Southern blot analysis on representative cpb2-positive(CWC245) and cpb2-negative (106527) C. perfringens isolatesusing HpaI or EcoRV restriction enzymes which have no cleav-age site within the cpb2 ORF. As expected, a DIG-labeled cpb2probe hybridized to an \ufffd5-kb HpaI or \ufffd7.5-kb EcoRV DNAfragment of CWC245, respectively (reference 29 and data notshown). However, no hybridizing band was observed withDNA from cpb2-negative isolate 106527 (Fig. 2).When the same HpaI RFLP-Southern blot assay was appliedto our collection of horse GI disease isolates, the cpb2 probehybridized to \ufffd20-kb HpaI DNA fragments from 21 out of 23surveyed isolates (Table 1; representative results are shown inFig. 2). Two isolates, AHT2600 and AHT2779, produced hy-bridizing bands of \ufffd8 kb and \ufffd14 kb, respectively (Table 1 andFig. 2). In order to confirm that these differing HpaI RFLPresults were not simply due to the loss of an HpaI restrictionsite, further RFLP analyses were performed on EcoRV-di-gested DNA (Fig. 2). These EcoRV RFLP results confirmedour HpaI RFLP results, demonstrating that the EcoRV RFLPpatterns of these two isolates are different from that of theother surveyed horse GI disease isolates (Fig. 2). These resultssuggest that all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates carrythe cpb2 sequences.PFGE evidence supporting the plasmid localization of cpb2in isolates from horses with GI diseases. To determinewhether cpb2 is located on the chromosome or plasmid inhorse GI disease isolates, representative cpb2-positive C. per-fringens isolates were subjected to PFGE-Southern blot anal-ysis, which has been successfully used (4, 6, 7, 24, 29) to for-mally establish the chromosomal or plasmid localization of cpeand cpb2. As expected, the cpb2-containing DNA from controlstrain CWC245 entered the pulsed-field gel in the absence ofrestriction enzyme digestion and produced a hybridizing bandof \ufffd50 kb (Fig. 3). These PFGE results confirmed previousobservations that cpb2 is located on the plasmid of cpb2-pos-itive isolate CWC245 (11, 29).When similar PFGE genotyping analyses were performed onDNA of representative cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates,their cpb2-containing plasmid DNA entered the pulsed-fieldgels and produced hybridizing bands that comigrated with thecpb2-containing plasmid DNA from CWC245 (Table 1; repre-sentative results are shown in Fig. 3). These results indicatedthat the cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolatescarry cpb2 on a plasmid.Comparison of the cpb2 ORFs present in different cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates. To examine whether horseGI disease isolates carry intact cpb2 ORFs, both strands of a1,373-bp PCR-amplified DNA insert carrying the cpb2 ORFsfrom three different horse GI disease isolates were nucleotidesequenced. These analyses (data not shown) revealed that noframeshift mutations or premature termination codons werefound in the cpb2 ORF sequences of the horse GI diseaseisolates which we surveyed. The cpb2 ORF sequences presentin horse GI disease isolates were identical to one another.Furthermore, the cpb2 ORF sequences present in three ofthese isolates match the previously determined (11) cpb2 ORFsequence from CWC245 (a type C strain isolated from a dis-eased pig in France) except for one nucleotide change. Thereplacement of G with A at position 408 (from ATG) in cpb2ORFs of surveyed horse GI disease isolates creates a replace-ment of valine with isoleucine. These results suggest that oursurveyed three horse GI disease isolates carry a consensus, butFIG. 2. RFLP-Southern blot analysis of HpaI- or EcoRV-digestedDNA from horse GI disease isolates.

The Southern blots wereprobed with a 318-bp DIG-labeled cpb2-specific probe. Results shownfor control isolates include those for 106527 (a cpb2-negative type Cstrain).

Comparison of the cpb2 upstreamand downstream sequences present in all three isolates re-vealed that both upstream and downstream sequences wereidentical in all three horse GI disease isolates and matched thepreviously determined cpb2 upstream and downstream se-quences of CWC245 (11).RT-PCR analysis of cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.Having obtained evidence for the presence of intact cpb2ORFs in all of our surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negativehorse GI disease isolates, we performed RT-PCR analyses toevaluate whether the cpb2 ORFs in these isolates were tran-scriptionally active. When control experiments were performedto confirm the specificity and reliability of the RT-PCR assay,no detectable RT-PCR-amplified product was observed withRNA of a cpb2-positive isolate, CWC245, in the absence of RT(Fig. 4A), indicating that no contaminating DNA was presentin the RNA preparation. However, as expected, a 318-bp am-plified product was detected in RNA of CWC245 in the pres-ence of RT (Fig. 4A). The size of the RT-PCR-amplifiedproduct exactly matched the size of the product obtained in thecontrol PCR using CWC245 chromosomal DNA as a templateand the same primers (Fig. 4B). These results indicated thatthe cpb2 mRNA is present in total RNA of CWC245.When the same RT-PCR analysis was applied to RNA fromour four representative horse GI disease isolates (106902,106903, AHT327, and AHT3992), the 318-bp RT-dependentamplified product was detected in total RNA of all four sur-veyed isolates (Fig. 4A and data not shown). The size of eachRT-PCR-amplified product exactly matched the size of thePCR product obtained with DNA of each surveyed isolate(Fig. 4B and data not shown). These results suggest that thehorse GI disease isolates are able to produce cpb2-specifictranscripts and that the negative CPB2 production in theseisolates may not be due to the transcriptional inactivation ofcpb2.Comparative Northern blot analysis of cpb2-positive horseGI disease isolates. After we demonstrated the presence ofcpb2 transcripts in RNA of our surveyed isolates, it became ofinterest to compare the level of cpb2 mRNA synthesis in CPB2Western blotting-negative horse GI disease isolates with thatin the CPB2-producing pig isolate CWC245 by Northern blotanalysis. As shown in Fig. 5, our cpb2-specific probe hybridizedto an \ufffd1.2-kb mRNA species present in RNA samples ex-tracted from CWC245. The size of the CWC245 cpb2 tran-script matched the size of the cpb2 transcript (\ufffd1.4 kb) fromstrain 13 (22) and was in close agreement with the cpb2 codingsequence from CWC245 (10). However, as expected, thisprobe showed no hybridization to RNA samples extractedfrom a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (Fig. 5), even thoughethidium bromide staining (data not shown) confirmed thatequivalent amounts of RNA samples from both CWC245 and106527 had been electrophoresed. These results indicated thatour Northern blot results were reliable and specific.When these Northern blot analyses were applied to RNAprepared from C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates, a single1.2-kb band, which comigrated with the cpb2 probe-reactiveband of CWC245, was detected in RNA from all our surveyedisolates (Fig. 5 and Table 1). However, the expression of cpb2in horse GI disease isolates was significantly low compared tothat in pig isolate CWC245 (Fig. 5A). Over three experimentalrepetitions, the 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was repro-ducibly less abundant in RNA samples extracted from oursurveyed horse GI disease isolates than in RNA samples ex-tracted from CWC245, possibly because these strains producedtoo little cpb2 message, as would be consistent with Westernblotting results indicating no detectable CPB2 production byhorse GI disease isolates. Time course experiments demon-strated that the maximal cpb2 transcription in 3-h growth cul-tures of both pig isolate CWC245 and horse isolate 106903 andthe transcription level gradually decreased over the time pe-riod. Although expression of cpb2 was continued up to 10 h inthe growth culture of CWC245, no cpb2 transcript could bedetected in the 106903 culture after 8 h (Fig. 5B). When therelative cpb2 mRNA levels were determined by semiquantita-tive Northern blot analysis, an average difference of 35-fold incpb2 transcription levels was observed between a pig strain(CWC245) producing high levels of CPB2 and five surveyedhorse GI disease strains (170, AHT327, AHT3992, 106902, and106903) producing undetectable levels of CPB2 (Fig. 5C anddata not shown). These results suggest that decreased tran-scription and/or message instability may be involved, at least inpart, in the low CPB2 production levels noted for the horse GIdisease isolates compared with that for pig GI disease isolateCWC245.Overexpression of cpb2 in horse GI disease isolates 106902and 106903 by a recombinant plasmid carrying the cpb2 genefrom 106902.

When total RNA extracted from TGY cul-tures of either 106902(pMRS140) or 106903(pMRS140) wassubjected to Northern blot analyses, a single 1.2-kb cpb2probe-specific band was detected (Fig. 5A and data notshown). The 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was reproduc-ibly more abundant in RNA samples extracted from106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140) than in RNA sam-ples extracted from host strains 106902 and 106903, respec-tively (Fig. 5A and data not shown). There were no differencesin the abundance of the 1.2-kb species in RNA samples ex-tracted from 106902(pMRS140), 106903(pMRS140), andCWC245 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). These results suggestthat the cpb2 gene present on the multicopy plasmid pMRS140could overexpress cpb2 mRNA in 106902 and 106903.CPB2 Western blot analyses (Fig. 6) demonstrated that theplasmid pMRS140 could overproduce CPB2 in 106902 and106903. pMRS140 transformants were able to produce CPB2in a secretion-dependent manner reminiscent of CPB2 produc-tion by CWC245; that is, neither pMRS140 transformant pro-duced detectable CPB2-specific immunoreactivity in total cellproteins (data not shown), but the transformants did produceCPB2-specific immunoreactivity in culture supernatant pro-teins (Fig. 6). CPB2 Western blots also demonstrated, as ex-pected, that CPB2 production (Fig. 6 and data not shown) wasabsent from both total cell and culture supernatant proteinswhen the shuttle vector pJIR751 alone was introduced into106902 or 106903, confirming that the observed overproduc-tion of CPB2 in 106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140)was specifically caused by transcomplementation of the wild-type cpb2 gene present in pMRS140. Collectively, these resultsindicated that the cpb2 gene present in horse GI disease isolate106902 was functional and that there was a positive correlationFIG. 5.

PERFRINGENS 4007between cpb2 message levels and the amount of CPB2 pro-duced by C. perfringens.DISCUSSIONOur present study reports an array of evidence supportingthe hypothesis that all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolatescarry a functional cpb2 gene and that the lack of CPB2 pro-duction is not due to the inactivation or loss of the cpb2 gene.(i) RFLP- and PFGE-Southern blot analyses reconfirmed thepresence of cpb2 sequences on a large plasmid in all of oursurveyed horse GI disease isolates. (ii) Nucleotide sequencingidentified intact cpb2 ORFs in our surveyed CPB2 Westernblotting-negative isolates. The cpb2 ORF sequences present inthree surveyed horse GI disease isolates are identical to oneanother and to previously determined (11, 29) cpb2 ORF se-quences. (iii) Finally, complementation studies demonstratedthat a recombinant plasmid carrying 106902 cpb2 increasedCPB2 production in 106902 cells to a detectable level (Fig. 6),indicating that the 106902 cpb2 gene is fully functional. Col-lectively, these results suggested that the differences in CPB2production levels observed between CWC245 and our sur-veyed horse GI disease isolates may be due to differences incpb2 transcription levels.The most significant finding of this study is the presentationof the first evidence that cpb2 is transcriptionally active in all ofour surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negative isolates and theobservation of an average of 35-fold-lower mRNA levels inhorse GI disease isolates than in pig GI disease isolateCWC245. This lower level of mRNA synthesis might be amajor cause of the undetectability of CPB2 production in horseGI disease isolates. This idea received further support fromour observation that the complementing strain106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levelsof mRNA than its parent strain, 106902 (Fig. 5A), producedCPB2 at a level similar to CWC245 (Fig. 6). These findingsprovide a genetic basis, at least in part, for the lack of adetectable level of CPB2 production in vitro in C. perfringenshorse GI disease isolates, which may also be applicable toother nonporcine isolates characterized previously (5), whereonly 50% of cpb2-positive nonporcine isolates produced CPB2.Our complementation studies also suggest that there is apositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and theamount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and thatdecreased transcription and/or message instability may be in-volved, at least in part, in the lower CPB2 production noted forthe horse GI disease isolates than for pig isolate CWC245. Wedid not examine stabilities of cpb2 mRNAs and therefore can-not rule out the possibility that the cpb2 mRNAs of horse GIdisease isolates are less stable than that of CWC245. However,no degraded cpb2 transcript was detected on the Northern blotof our surveyed isolates (Fig. 5), suggesting that the differencein CPB2 production levels in vitro between CWC245 and horseGI disease isolates may have arisen due to different rates ofcpb2 transcription. The differential level of alpha-toxin gene(plc) transcription in C. perfringens was previously reported;the levels of plc transcripts differ up to 40-fold from one C.perfringens type to another, and the greater production of al-pha-toxin by the type A strains is due mainly to an increasedlevel of plc transcripts (17, 28). Further transcriptional analysesof a large number of cpb2-positive type C isolates should ad-dress whether the difference in the levels of cpb2 transcriptionin CWC245 (type C pig strain) and horse GI disease isolates(type A) observed in our present study is typically due toisolates\u2019 type (type A versus type C) or origin (pig versushorse).What could be responsible for the different rates of cpb2transcription between CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates?An inverted repeat sequence identified in the downstreamregion of the CWC245 cpb2 sequence (11) is also present inour surveyed horse GI disease isolates. The cpb2 upstreampromoter region is identical in both pig and horse isolates. The1,373-bp sequenced fragment does not contain any featureswhich would account for different cpb2 expression levels be-tween pig strain CWC245 and surveyed horse GI disease iso-lates. Therefore, it can be envisioned that the relevant differ-ence(s) might be present outside of this fragment and beinvolved in regulating cpb2 expression.The association of cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A iso-lates with GI diseases in horses raises an important, but stillunanswered, question. Is this low-level expression of cpb2enough to cause any GI symptoms of CPB2-associated GIdiseases, or do these symptoms also result from expression ofother C. perfringens toxin(s)? Our present study does not ruleout the possibility that these cpb2-positive type A horse GIdisease isolates acquire high-level expression of cpb2 in vivo,which could be enough to cause symptoms of CPB2-associatedGI diseases in horses. All of the type A horse GI diseaseisolates surveyed in this study were classified as cpe-negativetype A isolates, indicating that the production of C. perfringensenterotoxin or beta-, iota-, or epsilon-toxin is not required fora CPB2-producing type A isolate to cause GI diseases inhorses. Since the present study confirmed that cpb2-positivetype A horse GI disease isolates can produce both CPB2 andalpha-toxin, it is possible that alpha-toxin also can be a majorcontributor to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by theseisolates. Further CPB2 and alpha-toxin knockout studiesshould address the relative contributions of CPB2 and alpha-toxin in cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A-associated GI dis-eases in animals.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research was supported by a grant from the N.
