C6 glioma andhuman microvascular endothelial cells were treated with conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cells irradiated at arange of doses and the migration of both cell types, tube formation by endothelial cells, as well as the expression andsecretion of migration-related proteins were evaluated. Exposure to X-ray radiation-conditioned medium induced dose-dependent increases in cell migration and tube formation, which were accompanied by an upregulation of vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression. However, glioma cells treated withconditioned medium of cells irradiated at a carbon ion dose of 4.0 Gy showed a marked decrease in migratory potential andVEGF secretion relative to non-irradiated cells. The application of recombinant VEGF165 stimulated migration in glioma andendothelial cells, which was associated with increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861, suggesting that the suppression ofcell migration by carbon ion radiation could be via VEGF-activated FAK signaling. Taken together, these findings indicatethat carbon ion may be superior to X-ray radiation for inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through modulation ofVEGF level in the glioma microenvironment.Citation: Liu Y, Liu Y, Sun C, Gan L, Zhang L, et al.

Radiotherapy, a standard adjuvantto surgery, improves survival rates in patients, but resistance totreatment by some gliomas limits the success of clinical application[2].High linear energy transfer (LET) heavy ions such as carbonions have attracted attention as alternatives to conventionalradiation for radiotherapy\u2014particularly for tumors that areradiation-resistant under hypoxic conditions\u2014owing to theirsuperior physical characteristics and high lethality for tumor cellscompared to low-LET radiation such as X- and c-rays [3\u20134]. Ourown studies have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy offers a highdegree of control for targeting tumors and increases progression-free survival rates without significant radiation-induced toxicity inskin carcinoma patients [5].Emerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironmentcontributes to radiation resistance [6] by regulating the levels ofcytokines and growth factors, including vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) [7], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [8], hepatocyte growthfactor (HGF) [9], and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [10], andpromoting extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloprotei-nases (MMPs) [11].Due to the scarcity of particle accelerators that can produceheavy ion radiation, it has not yet been established whether carbonions can modify the glioma microenvironment and affect themigratory behavior of cells during tumor progression andmetastasis. To address this question, the present study evaluatedthe contribution of carbon ion radiation to the motility of gliomaand endothelial cells using tumor-conditioned culture medium asan inducer.Materials and MethodsCell culture techniquesC6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection) weregrown in Ham\u2019s F-12 media (Gibco, Invitrogen Crop, USA)supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone,China). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1, Amer-ican Type Culture Collection) were grown in a modified MCDB131 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) medium containing20% FBS and 1.0 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/mlhuman epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma). All cells werecultured in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37uC.PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0098448&domain=pdfIrradiation ProcedureC6 glioma cells were irradiated by heavy ion beams and X-rays.Carbon ion irradiation was performed by the equipment at theHeavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR, Instituteof Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou,China). Glioma cells were exposed to carbon ion irradiation atenergy 350 MeV u21and LET 15.4 keV mm21, with a dose rateof 0.5 Gy min21. X-rays were from a cabinet X-ray irradiationsystem (100 kpv, 3 mA, beryllium window thickness 0.76 mm,Faxitron X-ray corp.). The dose rate was set to about 1.3 Gy/min.The film-to-source distance was set to 40.6 cm. Glioblastoma cellswere irradiated with 0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 Gy.Tumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) and Irradiatedconditioned medium (ICM) preparationTo generate TCM, C6 glioma cells were seeded at a density of56105 cells/25 cm2 culture flasks. At 90% confluence of cellmonolayer, culture medium was discarded to remove growthfactors. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with saline solution and fedwith fresh serum-free medium. TCM were collected from sham-irradiated cells considered as control conditioned medium. Toobtain the ICM, cells were irradiated with carbon ion beams or X-rays under sterile conditions. And then irradiated cells wereimmediately rinsed three times with saline solution and fed withfresh serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, the superna-tants was harvested and centrifuged at 20006g for 15 min andpassed through a 0.22 mm filter to remove cells and cell debris.This supernatant was stocked in 1.5 ml tubes and kept at 280uC.Transwell migration assaysThe in vitro cell migration assays were performed by using amodified Boyden chamber inserted with polyethylene terephthal-ate filter membrane containing 8 mm pores in 24-well plates(Millipore, Milan, Italy). The upper chamber contained C6 gliomacells or HMEC-1 cells in serum-free culture medium, and thelower chamber contained TCM or ICM. After 24 h of incubation,migrated cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 1 h and thenstained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 10 min and images wereprocessed using AxioVs40 software (Ver. 4.8.0.0, Carl Zeiss,Germany). Data were obtained by measuring ten randomlyselected fields of transwell-migrated cells using Image-Pro Plus 6.0software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).Gene expression analysisTotal RNA was extracted form glioma cells at 24 h after carbonion or X-ray irradiation using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufactur-er\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNAusing RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Real-time polymerasechain reaction (quantitative PCR) was carried out the SYBRPremix EX Taq II kit (Takara, China) on an FTC-3000+instrument (Funglyn Biotech INC, Toronto, ON, Canada). Geneexpression was detected using qPCR primers for VEGF and b-actin which was used to normalize the mRNA and cDNA quantityand quality. Sequences of the primers are as follows: VEGF sense,59-GATCATGCGGATCAAACCTCACC-39, and antisense, 59-CCTCCGGACCCAAAGTGCTC-39; b-actin sense, 59-TGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGTGGAT-39, and antisense, 59-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-39. The PCR programwas denatured at 95uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for5 s, 60uC for 30 s. The fold changes of gene expression of thetreatment groups were calculated by the 2-DDCtmethod [12].Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assayThe LDH leakage was determined by using commerciallyavailable kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Thecells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed to release theintracellular LDH into the new supernatant at 24 h after exposureto radiation. The supernatant (120 ml) was mixed with 60 ml ofLDH reagent solution, sheltered from light and incubated at roomtemperature for 30 min. The LDH activity of the medium (LDHmedium) and the cell lysate (LDH cells) were determined using acolorimetric assay at an absorbance wavelength of 490 nm and areference wavelength of 630 nm using an Infinite M200 micro-plate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The measured LDH activitieswere calculated by percentage of LDH released in the supernatantto that of cell lysates from intact cells (% LDH released).Wound-healing assayCells were seeded in a six-well plate at a concentration of 56105per well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer. The layer ofcells was scratched with a 1000 ml micropipette tip. Cells werethen washed twice with fresh medium and replaced with TCM orICM. Cells migrated into the wounded area, and photographswere taken immediately (0 h) and 24 h. The ability of cell motilitywas calculated by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernet-ics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in the following way: the areacovered by the migrating cells (24 h)/the wound area (0 h).Tube formation assay96-well plates were coated with 60 ml of Matrigel (BDBiosciences, San Jose, CA) and allowed to solidify at 37uC for1 h. After the Matrigel solidified, HMEC-1 endothelial cells(86105 cells/ml) were added in 200 ml of TCM or ICM. The cellswere incubated at 37uC with humidified 95% air/ 5% CO2 for8 h and photographed with the Carl Zeiss. Five randomly selectedmicroscopic tube length was assayed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).Cytokine protein quantificationWe measured tumor-derived secreted cytokines according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions. VEGF (ExCell Biology, Inc., Shang-hai, China), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,China) in the TCM or ICM of C6 glioma cells were detected byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Western blot analysisProtein sample preparation was basically performed as previ-ously described [13]. Protein samples were load onto 10%acrylamide gels for Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then the proteins were trans-ferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore Corpo-ration, USA). The membrane was blocked and subsequentlyincubated with anti-phospho-FAK antibody (Tyr861, Cell Signal-ing Technology, MA, USA) and anti-b-actin antibody (Santa CruzBiotechnology Inc., USA). Secondary probes were detected byECL Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). Andthe images were captured and analyzed by a FluorChem 2imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA).Statistical analysisThe results were expressed as means 6 standard error of themean (SEM). Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by LSD as a post-hoc test. Statisticaldifferences between the two groups were analyzed by Student\u2019s t-Carbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell MigrationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448test. A p-value less than 0.05 was selected as a criterion for astatistically significant difference.ResultsCancer cell migration and invasion into adjacent tissues, andintravasation into blood/lymphatic vessels are key events inmalignant tumor progression. To investigate the effect of radiationon these processes, glioma and endothelial cells were treated withconditioned media from glioma cell cultures exposed to varyingdoses of radiation. Tumor-conditioned media from culturesexposed to carbon ion radiation suppressed migration by 11.8%at 2.0 Gy and 17.4% at 4.0 Gy compared to control cells treatedwith medium from unirradiated cultures after 24 h of exposure(Fig. 1A). In contrast, cell migration was markedly enhanced whenmedia from X-ray-irradiated cultures was used as a chemoat-tractant (Fig. 1B).Endothelial cell migration is essential for angiogenesis, a processthat is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progres-sion. HMEC-1 cells incubated with conditioned media fromcarbon ion-irradiated cultures showed a decrease in migration at4.0 Gy compared to controls (Fig. 2A, C), while in cells incubatedwith media from X-ray-irradiated cultures, a dose-dependentincrease in migration was observed compared to control cells(Fig. 2B).In later stages of angiogenesis, endothelial cells self-assembleinto tubes to form new blood vessels. To investigate the effect ofradiation on neovascularization, HMEC-1 cells were cultured onMatrigel-coated plates in the conditioned media. After an 8 hincubation, control cells formed tubular structures (Fig. 3A, B).Cells cultured in media from X-ray-irradiated glioma cell culturesformed a greater number of capillary-like structures than controlcells (Fig. 3B); however, cells exposed to media from heavy ion-irradiated cells formed fewer tubules than controls (Fig. 3C).VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels in conditioned media fromcultures of glioma cells treated with varying doses of X-ray orcarbon ion radiation were evaluated by ELISA. All three proteinswere present at higher levels in the media of X-ray-irradiatedcultures than in unirradiated cell culture medium (Fig. 4). Therewere no differences in the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 betweencarbon ion-irradiated cells and controls; however, VEGF concen-tration was 17.5% lower in the medium of cells irradiated withcarbon ion at 4.0 Gy compared to the control culture (Fig. 4A).To determine whether the altered levels of VEGF protein intumor-conditioned media were due to transcriptional upregula-tion, the VEGF mRNA level in glioma cells was assessed by RT-Figure 1.

VEGF transcript levels in the 2.0, 4.0,and 8.0 Gy X-ray radiation groups were higher by approximately1.44-, 1.79-, and 2.66-fold relative to the control group (Fig. 5A).In contrast, exposure to carbon ion radiation resulted in thedownregulation of VEGF gene expression at 4.0 (0.4660.09) and8.0 Gy (0.4860.09). LDH is a sensitive indicator of the metabolicstate of cells, and is rapidly released into the culture medium upondamage to the plasma membrane. Irradiated glioma cells hadhigher LDH activity in the medium compared to unirradiatedcontrol cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, cells exposed to 8.0 Gy carbon ionradiation had increased LDH in the medium compared to thoseexposed to the lower doses of 2.0 and 4.0 Gy, indicating thathigher carbon ion radiation doses produced greater plasmamembrane damage.To examine the functional significance of altered VEGF level inthe culture medium of irradiated tumor cells, conditioned mediawere supplemented with recombinant VEGF165 (50 ng/ml) andthe effect on cell migration was evaluated by wound-healing assay.The migration of HMEC-1 and C6 glioma cells was increased by1.31- and 1.58-fold, respectively, in the presence of VEGF165(Fig. 6C). Moreover, after a 4 h incubation in media from carbonion-irradiated cell cultures supplemented with VEGF165, both celltypes showed increases in levels of phosphorylated FAK (Y861)(Fig. 6D).DiscussionRadiotherapy with or without surgery is a standard treatmentfor malignant gliomas [14]. However, tumor cell responses toradiation are complex, with evidence suggesting that radiationfrom X- and c-rays not only cause the death of tumor cells, butcan alternatively lead to the emergence of greater aggressivity andmalignancy, allowing cells to escape the lethal effects of radiationand remain resistant to conventional therapy [15\u201316].Heavy ion radiation therapy has shown promise for thetreatment of head and neck cancers\u2014even those that are resistantto standard radiation by directly targeting the DNA of tumor cells[17\u201318]. In the present study, the effects of high LET carbon ionand low LET X-ray radiation on glioma and endothelial cellmigration were compared, using tumor-conditioned medium as aninducer. Media from cultures of C6 glioma cells exposed to 2.0 or4.0 Gy carbon ion radiation suppressed migration of both celltypes (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that irradiation with heavy ionscan potentially attenuate the growth and metastasis of glioblasto-mas. In addition, the formation of endothelial cell tubules wasinhibited upon incubation with the same conditioned medium(Fig. 3), implying that angiogenesis can be similarly blocked.Carbon ion radiation has been shown to suppress migration andthe formation of capillary-like tube structures in ECV304 andhuman umbilical vascular endothelial cells at a dose of 0.1 GyFigure 2.

Representative imagesare shown of migrating HMEC-1 cells exposed to conditioned medium from cultures of A. unirradiated or heavy ion-irradiated, or B. unirradiated or Xray-irradiated glioma cells. C. Quantification of the number of migratory endothelial cells is expressed as means 6 standard error of the mean fromthree independent experiments, in which treatments were performed in triplicate. *P,0.05, ***P,0.001 vs. controls (0 Gy).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098448.g002Carbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell MigrationPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448[19]. In contrast, conditioned media from tumor cells exposed toX-ray radiation stimulated cell migration and tube formation,consistent with previous findings [20]. The migration and invasionof glioma cells into surrounding normal brain tissue and bloodvessels contributes to the limited responsiveness of gliomas toconventional radiation treatments [21\u201322]. Thus, for resistanttumors, carbon ions can offer greater therapeutic effectivenesscompared to X-rays owing to the superior physical properties ofhigh LET particles that transfer a greater amount of energy perunit length of track, which consequently increases the spatialdensity of energy deposition events [23].The tumor microenvironment is dynamic and can be altered byradiation treatment. In accordance with earlier studies [20,24\u201325],the present data showed that X-ray radiation enhanced thesecretion of VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor [26], as wellas that of MMP-2 and -9, which degrade the basement membraneand extracellular matrix during tumor cell invasion and metastasis[27]. In contrast, VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels were notsignificantly increased by carbon ion radiation; indeed, VEGFsecretion was reduced at 4.0 Gy (Fig. 4), implying that carbon ionsmay suppress glioblastoma angiogenicity and tumorigenicity bymodulating VEGF production and release into the tumormicroenvironment. However, the secreted VEGF induced bycarbon ion radiation was not dose-dependent, and reached aminimum at 4.0 Gy. One explanation for this observation is thatthe expression of pro-angiogenic genes and disruption of tumorcell membrane integrity are largely determined by growth factorsecretion. Thus, although VEGF transcript expression wassuppressed at 4.0 and 8.0 Gy carbon ion radiation, the increasein the permeability of the cell membrane as reflected by LDHactivity in the culture medium was more obvious at 8.0 Gy,because damage to the plasma membrane at the higher radiationdose resulted in the release of proteins into the medium.Therefore, in view of the combined effects of above-mentionedfactors, the minimum production of VEGF in the conditionedmedium was exhibited at 4.0 Gy carbon-ion radiation group.To identify the mechanism by which carbon ion radiation-induced VEGF stimulates cell motility, cells were treated withrecombinant VEGF165 and the phosphorylation status of thedownstream factor FAK was examined. FAK is a non-receptortyrosine kinase present at cell-cell contacts that is involved inintegrin-mediated signal transduction [28], and tyrosine phos-phorylation of FAK is required for cell migration [29\u201330]; VEGFinduces FAK phosphorylation at Y397, Y407, and Y861 [31\u201332].Here, the application of exogenous VEGF increased migration inendothelial and glioma cells concomitant with increased FAKphosphorylation at Y861 (Fig. 6), indicating that carbon ionradiation may promote the metastatic and angiogenic potential oftumors through VEGF/FAK signaling.In summary, the present results demonstrate that high-LETcarbon ion radiation is superior to low-LET X-rays for suppressingthe migration of glioma and endothelial cells, and thus inhibitingtumorigenesis and angiogenesis via regulation of VEGF-mediatedsignaling in the tumor microenvironment. These findings provideevidence in favor of carbon ion over X-ray radiation for thetreatment of tumors that are resistant to conventional radiother-Figure 3.
