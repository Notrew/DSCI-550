Glucotoxicity mediated by chronic hyperglycaemia is detrimental to the function and survival ofpancreatic beta cells. The aim of our study was to determine whether proteasome dysfunction could be involved in beta cellapoptosis in glucotoxic conditions, and to evaluate whether such a dysfunction might be pharmacologically corrected.Therefore, UPS activity was measured in GK rats islets, INS-1E beta cells or human islets after high glucose and/or UPSinhibitor exposure. Immunoblotting was used to quantify polyubiquitinated proteins, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressthrough CHOP expression, and apoptosis through the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, whereas total cell death wasdetected through histone-associated DNA fragments measurement. In vitro, we found that chronic exposure of INS-1E cellsto high glucose concentrations significantly decreases the three proteasome activities by 20% and leads to caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. We showed that pharmacological blockade of UPS activity by 20% leads to apoptosis in a same way.Indeed, ER stress was involved in both conditions. These results were confirmed in human islets, and proteasome activitieswere also decreased in hyperglycemic GK rats islets. Moreover, we observed that a high glucose treatment hypersensitizedbeta cells to the apoptotic effect of proteasome inhibitors. Noteworthily, the decreased proteasome activity can becorrected with Exendin-4, which also protected against glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings revealan important role of proteasome activity in high glucose-induced beta cell apoptosis, potentially linking ER stress andglucotoxicity. These proteasome dysfunctions can be reversed by a GLP-1 analog. Thus, UPS may be a potent target to treatdeleterious metabolic conditions leading to type 2 diabetes.Citation: Broca C, Varin E, Armanet M, Tourrel-Cuzin C, Bosco D, et al.

Although glucose is the main regulator of beta cell functionalmass, it can be deleterious when present in excessive amountsduring prolonged exposure [2]. Such a glucotoxicity is responsiblefor apoptosis of beta cells [3], mainly through inducing anoxidative stress, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and aninflammatory reaction. Understanding the exact mechanisms thatlink glucotoxicity to beta cell apoptosis is crucial for thepreservation of a functional pancreatic beta cell mass.The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is one of the majordegradation pathways for maintaining protein homeostasis. Itdegrades misfolded, oxidized or damaged proteins, but alsoregulates proteins involved in many cellular processes, such assignal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell death, and genetranscription [4,5]. Proteins to be degraded in the UPS are firsttagged with a polyubiquitin chain, then enter the 26S proteasome,a multicatalytic complex that associates a regulatory complex (19Sproteasome) with a catalytic core (20S proteasome). The 20Sproteasome is a cylindrical structure made of two outer rings of a-subunits and two inner heptameric rings of b-subunits that carrythe proteolytic activities, classified as caspase-like (b1), trypsin-like(b2), and chymotrypsin-like (b5), which cleave after acidic, basicand hydrophobic amino acids, respectively [6].The precise role of UPS in the beta cell remains elusive. UPSregulates key proteins of the beta cell secretory cascade such asKATP channels [7], voltage-dependent calcium channels [8], orproinsulin [9], thus playing a major but complex role in theregulation of insulin secretion [10,11,12,13]. The role of UPS inthe control of apoptosis/survival balance is also controversial [14].Indeed, UPS regulates key proteins for beta cell survival such asIRS-2, MafA, or CREB [15], but also major regulators ofapoptosis such as caspases (review in [16]). High doses ofproteasome inhibitors (PIs), that totally block UPS activities,induce severe apoptosis in beta cell lines [13,17] but only limitedPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/decrease in viability in human islets [17], have no impact on ratislet viability [13], or can improve rat islets viability in the presenceof cytokines [13].A link between an alteration of the UPS and the progression ofdiabetes has never been demonstrated. Indeed, proteasomedysfunction correlates with obesity in humans [10,18,19], andkidneys from diabetic Akita rats or streptozotocin-injected miceshow a decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity and an increase inpolyubiquinated proteins [20], but this is not seen in others tissus.Pancreatic islets from Zucker diabetic rats [21] or human diabeticobese donors [22] also exhibit an increased level of polyubiqui-tinated proteins, suggesting a default in the elimination ofdamaged/misfolded proteins, but the implication of a proteasomeactivity default is lacking. A recent study shows a decreased in isletsproteasome activity of type 2 diabetic patients [23] together with adecrease of UPS proteins transcription and expression. However,whether hyperglycemic environment is deleterious for beta cellsthrough an alteration of the proteasome is still unknown.In this aim, we studied the importance of proteasomedysfunction as a potential molecular mechanism associated withbeta cell failure in glucotoxic conditions, in the INS-1E beta cellline and in primary rat and human islets. We chose to explore therole of ER-stress in this process. Finally, we investigated if thisdecreased proteasome activity can be pharmacologically correctedthrough the use of GLP-1 analogs. Our results clearly show thatproteasome activity is a key determinant of the survival/apoptosisbalance in beta cells, that could be part of the glucotoxicitymechanisms involved in diabetes pathophysiology.Materials and MethodsEthics statementMale diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and Wistar control ratswere obtained from the Paris colony (GK/Par), and maintained atthe University Paris-Diderot animal core (Agreement A-75-13-17).The experimental protocol was approved by the institutionalAnimal Care and Use Ethical Committee of the Paris-DiderotUniversity (registration number CEEA-40), in accordance withaccepted standards of animal care as established in the FrenchNational Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) guidelines.Human pancreas were harvested from brain-dead non-diabeticdonors, identified from the CRISTAL register of the Agence de laBiomedecine, which inventories all graft recipients in France.Informed consent from the donor family and agreement forscientific research was obtained through the Departement de laCoordination Hospitalie\u0300re de Pre\u0301le\u0300vements d\u2019Organes of Mon-tpellier Hospital. Experiments were performed in agreement withthe Institutional Ethical Committee of the French Agence de laBiomedecine (ref. PFS13-008).Cell cultureINS-1E beta cells were originally cloned and characterized [24]by Pr. P. Maechler from the parental rat INS-1 cell line in theLaboratory of Pr. C.B. Wollheim (CMU, University of Geneva,Switzerland). INS-1E cells (a kind gift from Pr. P. Maechler) werecultured between passages 55-90 in RPMI-1640 medium contain-ing 10 mM glucose and 5% FCS (InVitrogen, St-Aubin,France)[24]. Cells were grown for four days in RPMI-1640 toreach 75% confluency, then incubated for 48 hours in RPMI-1640 medium with glucose ranging from 10 to 33 mM, in thepresence of BSA 0.5% instead of FCS in order to sensitize cells toglucotoxicity [25]. Proteasome inhibitors MG-132, ALLN,lactacystin (Calbiochem, VWR, France) or Bortezomib (VelcadeHJanssen, France) were added during the last 16 hours. Exendin-4was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Following treatments,cells were washed in PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (seecomposition in [26]) for Western-blot analysis, or in proteasomelysis solution (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20%glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet-P40, 1 mM mercapto-ethanol, and1 mM ATP) for proteasome activities measurement.AnimalsTwelve-week-old male non-diabetic Wistar and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were maintained at constant temperature (21\u201323uC) with a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle. Food and water wereavailable ad libitum. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated as previouslydescribed [27] and groups of 300\u2013500 islets were stored at 280uCuntil studied. Islets were harvested in similar lysis buffer than INS-1E for Western-blot analysis or proteasome activities measure-ment.Human pancreatic islets processingHuman islets were isolated from four brain-dead non-diabeticdonors at the Laboratory for Diabetes Cell Therapy (Montpellier,France) or the Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center (Geneva,Switzerland) according to a modified version of the automatedmethod [28,29]. After isolation, islets were cultured for recoveryduring 1\u20135 days in CMRL-1066 medium (InVitrogen) containing5.6 mM glucose, 10% FBS, antibiotics and glutamine [15]. Forexperiments with proteasome inhibitors, islets were then culturedduring 16 h in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5.6 mM glucoseand 1% human albumin (LFD Biomedicaments, Les-Ulis, France),and treated like rat islets. For chronic high-glucose experiments,islets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI-1640 medium containing5.6 or 33.3 mM glucose, in the absence of FCS but the presence of0.4 mM palmitate bound to BSA (0.5% BSA, molar ratiopalmitate/BSA = 5:1) in order to sensitize islets to glucotoxicity[30].Western-blot analysisFollowing treatments, INS-1E cells, rat or human islets werelysed for 30 min at 4uC in a cold lysis buffer as described above,then rapidly sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min.Supernatants were denatured by boiling them in Laemmli\u2019ssample buffer, normalized for protein content by a BCA assay, andequal amounts of proteins (25 mg of protein/lane) resolved by 10%SDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes,membranes were cut up into 3 or 4 pieces according to themolecular weights profile, in order to observe simultaneouslydifferent proteins on the same blot. Each piece was incubated withprimary then secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualizedby chemiluminescence detection, as previously described [15].Band densities were quantitatively analyzed by Image J (NIH,USA) and normalized to actin, used as our loading control. Anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-PARP (Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase), anti-ubiquitin, anti-CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Cell-Signaling (Ozyme, St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-proteasome 20S-b5 subunitand anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Santa-Cruz (Tebu-bio,Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-b-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Quentin-Fallavier, France).Proteasome activities measurementFollowing treatments, INS-1E cells and islets were lysed andprocessed for proteasome activity as described [31]. After rapidsonication, lysates were centrifuged (12,000 g) and supernatantscollected. After proteins level equalization, 5 mg supernatants wereProteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066combined with substrate buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mMEGTA) and 50 mM of each proteasome substrate; Z-ARR-MCA,Suc-LLVY-MCA, and Z-LLE-MCA (Calbiochem) were used tomeasure trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like activities,respectively. The three proteasome activities were distinguishedfrom background proteolytic activities by using a proteasomeinhibitor that nearly totally inhibit fluorescence changes. Thefluorescence intensity was measured at 380 nm excitation and460 nm emission with a Flexstation3 Reader (Molecular Devices,France) using free MCA as standard. Proteasomal activities wereexpressed as arbitrary units.Apoptosis and cell death detectionApoptosis was investigated using immunoblot by evaluatingcleavage of caspase-3 into a 17/19 kDa fragment corresponding tothe active pro-apoptotic form of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP(a caspase-3 target involved in DNA repair and cell survival) into a89 kDa fragment. Total cell death was evaluated using the CellDeath Detection ELISAPLUSkit (Roche), as per the manufactur-er\u2019s instructions, using 20 ml of culture supernatant. Due to ourprolonged treatments ($48 h), DNA fragments will be present inthe supernatant of cells culture as the result of the lysis of lateapoptotic cells as well as necrotic cells. Absorbance was measuredat 405 nm using a Mithras LB940 Reader (Berthold, Thoiry,Figure 1. Chronic high glucose induces apoptosis and proteasome activities decrease in INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells were cultured for48 hours at increasing concentrations of glucose ranging from 10 mM (G10) to 33 mM (G33).

Statistical differences between groups were analyzedby Student\u2019s t-test or by ANOVA followed by the Tukey\u2019s multiplecomparison test where appropriate, using Graphpad-Prismsoftware (La Jolla, USA). A P value ,0.05 was consideredsignificant.ResultsChronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high-glucose affectsproteasome activity and ubiquitinationIn INS-1E cells, increasing glucose from an optimal (10 mM) toa supra-physiologic (33 mM) level during 48 h is deleterious andleads to dose-dependent increases in cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-PARP (Figures 1A and 1B), and total cell death (Figure 1C).Besides, this chronic exposure to high-glucose significantlydecreases the 3 proteasome activities, with a 20\u201325% loss of thechymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities(Figure 1D). In parallel, the polyubiquitinated proteins level isincreased by 26% in the presence of high glucose, whereas the20S-b5 proteasome subunit level is not significantly altered(Figures 1E and 1F). Finally, we confirm that endoplasmicreticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by the two fold increase inCHOP expression (Figures 1E and 1F), is involved in the increasedapoptosis observed in beta cells submitted to high glucose.Impaired proteasome activities in hyperglycemic GK ratisletsWe assess ex vivo the impact of a hyperglycemic environment onbeta cell proteasome function using the GK rat diabetic model[32,33]. Pancreatic islets from 5 GK rats exhibiting mildhyperglycemia (around 9.0 mM) are compared to islets from 9Wistar control rats exhibiting normoglycemia (around 5.0 mM).GK rats islets show a slight increase in apoptosis, as revealed byPARP cleavage (Figures 2A and 2B). More importantly, GK ratislets display a 25% reduction in caspase-like activity (p,0.01), a40% reduction in trypsin-like activity (p,0.01), whereas chymo-trypsin-like activity was not significantly decreased (210%,p = 0.20) (Figure 2C). This suggests that the hyperglycemicenvironment could be linked to decreased proteasome activitiesin vivo.Loss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in INS-1EcellsIn order to implicate a proteasome dysfunction in beta cellapoptosis, we treated INS-1E cells with the widely usedproteasome inhibitor (PI) MG-132. In cells cultured into optimalglucose concentration for survival (i.e. 10 mM), MG-132 (150 nM)induces a 90, 80 and 50% inhibition of chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities, respectively (Figure 3A). This isaccompagnied by a significant increase (+150%) in polyubiquiti-Figure 2. Islets from hyperglycemic GK rats exhibit decreased proteasome activities together with increased cleaved PARP levels.A: Cleaved PARP protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting in 9 Wistar rats (W) or 5 GK rats (GK) independent islets preparations. Three mostrepresentative immunoblots from Wistar and GK rats are presented and actin was used as a loading control. B: Quantitative analysis of bandsdensities for cleaved PARP obtained by Western blot from 9 Wistar rats (W) or 5 GK rats (GK) independent islets preparations (as shown in A) werenormalized to actin. Results are presented as means 6 SEM and are expressed in arbitrary units (AU). C: Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities were measured in the lysates of islets from Wistar or GK rats. Results are presented as means 6 SEM of 9 (W) or 5 (GK) independent isletspreparations and are expressed in arbitrary unit (AU). *P,0.05 and **P,0.01 and ***P,0.001.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092066.g002Proteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066nated proteins level (Figure 3B), whereas the expression ofproteasome subunit 20S-b5 is not modified (data not shown). Inparallel, MG-132 induces the emergence of a caspase-dependentapoptosis as revealed by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP(Figure 3C). The implication of ER stress in the apoptotic effect ofMG-132 is confirmed by the emergence of CHOP expression(Figure 3C).The pro-apoptotic effect of PIs is also found using thestructurally different inhibitors ALLN (Figure 3D) and lactacystin(data not shown). Moreover, increasing MG-132 concentrationfrom 10 to 1000 nM gradually inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity(Figure 3E). This sigmoidal-shaped effect shows a low Ki at 50 nMand a near-total inhibition of UPS activity around 1 mM MG-132.This gradual decrease in proteasome activity is concommittantwith an increase in cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 3F), definitely linkingproteasome dysfunction and apoptosis. Finally, a 50 nM MG-132-exposure, leading to a minimal loss of proteasome activity about20%, is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Figure 3G). Interestingly,chymotrypsin-like activity and apoptotic level are similarly affectedin INS-1E cells exposed either to low dose (50 nM) of MG-132 orFigure 3. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome induces polyubiquitinated proteins accumulation and caspase-dependentapoptosis in INS-1E cells. A: Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities were measured in the lysates of INS-1E cells treated or notwith 150 nM MG-132. Results are presented as means 6 SEM of 5 independent experiments and expressed as percentage of the value without MG-132. B: Levels of polyubiquitinated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting in INS-1E cells treated or not with 150 nM MG-132 and quantified.Results shown as immunoblots are representative from 5 independent experiments.

Results are presented as means 6 SEM and expressed as fold induction of the value without MG-132.C: Levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, CHOP, and actin were analyzed by Western blotting in INS-1E cells exposed or not to 150 nM MG-132.Results presented are representative immunoblots and quantitative analysis of bands densities normalized to actin from 5 independent experiments.Results are means 6 SEM and expressed as fold increase of the value without MG132. D: Protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and actin were analyzedin INS-1E cells exposed or not to increasing concentrations (1\u201325 mM) of the UPS inhibitor ALLN by Western blotting, and were quantified.Immunoblots presented are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Results are expressed as fold increase of the control value without ALLN. E:Chymotrypsin-like activity was measured in the lysates from INS-1E cells treated or not with increasing concentrations of MG-132 (10 nM to 1 mM).Results are presented as means 6 SEM of 3 independent experiments and expressed as a percentage of the value without MG-132. F: Protein levelsof cleaved caspase-3 and actin were analyzed by Western blotting in INS-1E cells exposed or not to increasing concentrations (30\u2013500 nM) of the UPSinhibitor MG-132. Immunoblots presented are representative of 3 independent experiments. G: INS-1E cells were cultured either in 10 mM glucosewith increasing concentrations of MG-132 (0,50 and 150 nM) or in high (33 mM) glucose. Chymotrypsin-like activity was measured in cells lysates andpresented as means 6 SEM. Protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and actin were analyzed by Western blotting. Data are representative of 3independent experiments. *P,0.05, **P,0.01, and ***P,0.001.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092066.g003Proteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066to a chronic high-glucose level (Figure 3G). Thus, slightimpairment of UPS activity in beta cells induced similar apoptosisthan high-glucose exposure.Chronic high-glucose induces apoptosis and proteasomedysfunction in human isletsIn human islets, a 14 days-chronic high glucose (33 mM)exposure clearly induces a three-fold increase in total cell death(Figure 4A) and an increase in apoptosis as seen by caspase-3 andPARP cleavage (Figure 4B). More importantly, all the threeproteasome activities were significantly reduced by 40\u201350% inhigh glucose-exposed islets (Figure 4C). Finally, polyubiquitinatedproteins and CHOP expressions increase in these glucotoxicconditions (Figure 4B), thus confirming the presence of an ERstress linked to UPS dysfunction in human islets.Loss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in humanisletsIn human islets, MG-132 (0.05\u20131 mM) induces a progressivedecrease in chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, withoutsignificantly affecting trypsin-like activity (Figure 5A). In parallel,MG-132 dose-dependently increases the expression of polyubiqui-tinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP(Figure 5B and 5C). These effects are also found with 5 mMlactacystin or 100 nM bortezomib (data not shown). Thus PIs, byreducing proteasome activities, clearly induce polyubiquitinatedproteins accumulation and the emergence of a caspase-dependentapoptotic program through the promotion of ER-stress in rodentbeta cells and human islets.Chronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high-glucose induceshypersensitivity to proteasome inhibitorsWe further investigated the role of combination of high-glucoseexposure and proteasome inhibitors on beta cells. While 150 nMMG-132 induces a slight but significant apoptosis in INS-1E cellscultured in 10 mM glucose medium (Figure 6A), this sameconcentration of MG-132 induces a drastic apoptosis in INS-1Ecells cultured at high-glucose, as evidenced by the 8-fold increaseof cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Figure 6B). However, thepolyubiquitinated proteins level induced by MG-132 is similarlyhigh in normal or high-glucose concentrations (Figure 6C) as if aceiling was reached. Similar results on apoptosis are obtained withALLN (Figure 6D and 6E) or lactacystin (data not shown). Thisdrastic increase of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors coupled tohigh glucose culture reveals hypersensitivity of beta cells to UPSinhibition in glucotoxic conditions.Exendin-4 prevents proteasome activity dysfunction andprotects INS-1E cells from apoptosisWe finally investigated whether pharmacological agents thatactivate PKA in beta cells, such as the GLP-1 analog Exendin-4,could positively interact with proteasome activities. First, in INS-1E cells cultured into optimal 10 mM glucose medium, Exendin-4does not significantly modify the chymotrypsin-like activity(Figure 7A), nor the others proteasome activities (data not shown)or the cleaved caspase-3 expression (Figure 7B).Then, in INS-1E cells cultured in the presence of chronic high-glucose (33 mM), we observe, as expected, an increased caspase-dependent apoptotic program, decreased UPS activities, andaccumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins (Figure 7C and 7D). Inthese glucotoxic conditions, Exendin-4 (25 nM) clearly improvescell survival, with a significant reduction in the emergence ofcleaved caspase-3 induced by high-glucose (236%, p,0.05)(Figure 7C). Of importance, Exendin-4 also prevents proteasomedysfunction induced by high-glucose as shown on chymotrypsine-like activity (Figure 7D) and other proteasome activities (data notshown). Noteworthily, Exendin-4 tends to decrease (p = 0.13 vs.G33 alone) the polyubiquitinated levels observed in the presence ofchronic G33 (Figure 7C). Finally, this protective effect of Exendin-4 is dose-dependent on both proteasome activity and cell survival,reaching an optimum at 25 nM (Figure 7E).Figure 4. A chronic high glucose treatment decreases protea-some activities and increases apoptosis in human islets. Humanislets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI medium containing an optimal(5.6 mM, G5) or a high (33 mM, G33) glucose concentration. Fourindependent experiments were conducted using human islets fromfour independent islets isolations (4 different donors). A: Total celldeath was measured in the supernatants of culture medium. Data areexpressed as means 6 SEM as a percentage of the G5 value. B: Levels ofpolyubiquitinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP,and actin were analyzed by Western blotting after 14 days of culture.Immunoblots presented are representative of the 4 independentexperiments. C: Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activ-ities were measured in the lysates from human islets after 14 days ofculture. Data presented are means 6 SEM and are expressed as as apercentage of G5. *P,0.05, **P,0.01.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092066.g004Proteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta CellsPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066DiscussionThe balance between survival and death in pancreatic beta cellsplays a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We report herethat a chronic exposure of rat beta cells or human islets to high-glucose concentrations leads to a decrease in the proteasomeactivity and to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins.This inhibition of UPS activity leads to beta cell apoptosis in adose-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition ofUPS in the context of glucotoxicity drastically increases theseapoptotic effects, drawing the concept of hypersensitization of betacells to proteasome inhibitors (PIs). UPS activity -in this context ofglucotoxicity- can be partially restored by Exendin-4.First, we demonstrate that glucotoxic conditions can alterproteasome activities. This major finding must be connected to aprevious study [20] showing that proteasome activities weredecreased in endothelial cells cultured in high-glucose medium,and in kidney cells from diabetic mice but not in other tissues. Weshow here that this cell type-specific phenomenon can also affectbeta cell population. Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteinshas been previously observed in several models of diabetic betacells [21,22], suggesting indirectly an UPS alteration in hypergly-cemic environment. However, authors attributed this accumula-tion either 1) to a default in the autophagy system [21], or 2) to adeficiency in the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 [22]. Ourresults clearly indicate that a decrease in proteasome activity is alsoimplicated in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteinsobserved in beta cells submitted to a glucotoxic environment.When studying proteasome function in beta cells, specialattention should be paid to the specific proteasome activityobserved. Here we observed that the inhibitory effect of MG-132on trypsin-like activity is less important in INS-1E cells and totallyabsent in human islets compared to the chymotrypsin-like andcaspase-like activities. Indeed proteasomes are very heterogeneousprotein complexes: differences exists in the molecular assembly ofthe catalytic active b subunits, as well as differences in theirposttranslational modifications and in the presence of distinctassociating partners [34]. Thus, each cell contains a specific set ofproteasome subtypes, exhibiting specific proteasomal activities thatstrongly vary between tissues and age in the same animal, andexpress different susceptibilities to proteasome inhibitors such asMG-132 [35]. In this context, it was very recently noticed thattrypsin-like activity shows the greatest interspecies difference [36].Finally, in both INS-1E and human islets, the decrease of two ofthe three proteasome activities in the presence of MG-132 isenough to induce a global decrease of proteasome activity asobserved with the increase in polyubiquitinated protens level.The other main point of this study is that the inhibition ofproteasome activity can have per se a deleterious impact on betacell survival. Noteworthily, this pro-apoptotic effect of PIs existseven for a slight 220%- reduction of proteasome activity, the samepercentage of inhibition induced by high-glucose culture or 50 nMMG-132. Our results are in accordance with previous studiesFigure 5. Pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome activity in human islets increases apoptosis. Human islets were treated for 16 hourswith the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at increasing concentrations from 50 nM to 1 mM. Four independent experiments were conducted usinghuman islets from four independent islets isolations (4 different donors). A: Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities were measuredin the lysates of human islets treated or not with MG-132. Results are presented as means 6 SEM and expressed as a percentage of the value withoutMG-132. B: Levels of polyubiquitinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and actin were analyzed by Western blotting in humanislets after 16 hours of culture. Immunoblots presented are representative of the 4 independent experiments. C: Quantitative analysis of bandsdensities of Western blots as presented in B were normalized to actin.

For entire islets, the literature data werecontroversial, as a decrease in viability was observed in humanislets cultured with epoxomycin [17], whereas lactacystin had noimpact on beta cell viability of young rats [13]. We confirm herethat immortalized cell lines are more sensitive to the pro-apoptoticeffect of PIs than primary cells, even if the latter can still beimpacted by higher dose of PIs [37].We show that inhibition of proteasome activity in beta cellscould be a new link between glucotoxicity and apoptosis. Thisphenomenon -via genetic predisposition or epigenetic regulation-may thus exist in diabetic patients, participating in beta celldysfunction. Indeed, Bugliani et al. [23] recently showed that UPSgenes and activity were particularly altered in beta cells of type 2diabetic patients. Our study underlines the direct effect of high-glucose on UPS dysfunction, at a molecular level (probably at apost-traductional level) and not, as suggested in the latter study, ata transcriptional level. This is compatible with the hypothesis ofQueisser et al. [20] suggesting that glycation of the 20S-b5proteasome subunit by high-glucose treatment could affect itsactivity. Further studies should be done to confirm this hypothesis.Endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses are widely knownto be the main mechanisms of glucotoxicity [38,39], even ifcytokine production [40] or hypoxia also represent others putativestressors (review in [2]). Besides, the role of proteasome inhibitionin glucotoxicity is poorly defined. Indeed, the relationshipsbetween ER and proteasome are complex since they can influenceeach other. In our study, UPS dysfunction directly participates intriggering ER stress, CHOP expression, caspase cleavage andapoptosis onset. This results confirms previous studies showingthat proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or bortezomib can induceER stress, thus activating caspases cleavage and apoptosis incancerous or primary epithelial cells [41,42]. However, theopposite is also true since Menendez-Benito et al. [43] firstobserved in a panel of UPS reporter cell lines as well as in an in vivotransgenic mice model that ER stress could have an inhibitoryFigure 6. Chronic high-glucose exposure induces INS-1E cell hypersensitivity to the proapoptotic effect of proteasome inhibitors.INS-1E Cells were cultured for 48 hours with an optimal 10 mM (G10) or a high 33 mM (G33) glucose concentration, and treated with proteasomeinhibitors MG-132 or ALLN for the last 16 h.

In brief, proteasome inhibition by MG-132 orhigh-glucose exposure could induce ER stress and apoptosis, butER stress alone could also induce a progressive proteasomeinhibition in parallel to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Takentogether, this suggests that the glucotoxic-induced proteasomedysfunction observed in our study could be placed both above andbelow ER stress in the cascade leading from chronic hyperglyce-mia to beta cell apoptosis and diabetes.UPS dysfunction and proteasome activity inhibition canpromote neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington andAlzheimer diseases, both characterized by protein misfolding,aggregates accumulation, and ER stress increase. Diabetes is oftencompared to them because of islet amyloidosis, supposed to be dueto the UPS dysfunction [22]. Here, our study clearly reinforces theparallel between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases throughthe demonstration of the role of UPS dysfunction and ER stress inbeta cells exposed to high glucose.Depending on situations and cell types, UPS may play morethan a simple role of garbage collector and can direct cell functionand survival. In lymphocytes, glioma cells or hematopoieticprogenitor cells, UPS is placed at the top of the apoptoticmachinery, upstream of the mitochondrial and caspase activation[44,45]. Our results support a similar central role of UPS in thebeta cell apoptosis machinery. Indeed, in our study, glucotoxicconditions - mainly via ER and oxidative stresses- added todecreased proteasome activity with PIs led to a drastic apoptosis.This observation is compatible with the recent concept ofsensitization already described on myeloma cells cultured withFigure 7. Exendin-4 partially prevents chronic high glucose-induced apoptosis and proteasome dysfunction in INS-1E cells.

The sensitivity of myeloma cells toapoptosis induction by PIs varies greatly between cell types andcorrelates with expression levels of proteasome subunits and/orthe proteasome activity itself, as a result of a balance betweenproteasome workload and degradation capacity [46]. Similarly,high-glucose-treated beta cells display a decrease in proteasomeactivities together with an increased workload in insulin synthesisand secretion. In glucotoxic conditions, it seems thus logical thatUPS inhibition can lead to an over-workload, majored ER stress,and drastic apoptosis. That confirms that the maintenance of UPSintegrity is a key player in the misfolded protein clearance and inthe regulation of essential functions of beta cells. This beta cellhypersensitivity to PIs under glucotoxicity could have clinicalimplications, suggesting hypersensitivity of diabetic patients toproteasome inhibitors like bortezomib used in myeloma. Indeed,PIs efficacy may be reinforced on cancerous cells, but their adverseeffects -peripheral neuropathy or anemia- may be more numerousand severe in diabetic patients [47].Finally, the demonstration that the GLP-1-receptor agonistExendin-4 preserves proteasome activity from the deleteriouseffects of chronic high glucose reinforces the fact that thepreservation of UPS activity is crucial for beta cell survival,especially in glucotoxic conditions. Moreover, a parallel existsbetween Exendin-4 dose-responses on proteasome activity increaseand caspase-3 cleavage reduction. This restoration of UPS activityby a GLP-1 analogue can be explained by the role of PKA in betacells. Indeed, GLP-1 analogues act through PKA in beta cells andPKA has been shown to be a direct activator of proteasomeactivity [48,49]. This opens the possibility to increase in vivo theactivity of GLP-1 analogues with activators of UPS.In conclusion our work integrates UPS as a new key player inthe mechanism of glucotoxicity in beta cells. We report here thatchronic high-glucose exposure decreases proteasome activities inbeta cells, leading to UPS dysfunction. Proteasome dysfunctioncould be part of the glucotoxic mechanisms through inducing ERstress and apoptosis. Apoptotic hypersensitization of beta cellsexists when pre-existing glucotoxicity and UPS inhibition areadded: this creates a vicious circle resulting in increased apoptosisof beta cells. GLP-1 analogues can help stopping this vicious circle.Our results suggest that proteasome function constitutes animportant and underestimated target for restoring pancreatic betacell survival and GLP-1 analogues efficacy.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thanks M.
