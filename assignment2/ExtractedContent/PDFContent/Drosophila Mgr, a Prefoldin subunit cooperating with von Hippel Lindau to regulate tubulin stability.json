However, the identity of its gene producthas remained undiscovered. We now show that mgr encodes thePrefoldin subunit counterpart of human von Hippel Lindau bind-ing-protein 1. Depletion of Mgr from cultured cells also leads toformation of monopolar and abnormal spindles and centrosomeloss. These phenotypes are associated with reductions of tubulinlevels in both mgr flies and mgr RNAi-treated cultured cells. More-over, mgr spindle defects can be phenocopied by depleting \u03b2-tu-bulin, suggesting Mgr function is required for tubulin stability.Instability of \u03b2-tubulin in the mgr larval brain is less pronouncedthan in either mgr testes or in cultured cells. However, expressionof transgenic \u03b2-tubulin in the larval brain leads to increased tubu-lin instability, indicating that Prefoldin might only be requiredwhen tubulins are synthesized at high levels. Mgr interacts withDrosophila von Hippel Lindau protein (Vhl). Both proteins interactwith unpolymerized tubulins, suggesting they cooperate in regu-lating tubulin functions. Accordingly, codepletion of Vhl with Mgrgives partial rescue of tubulin instability, monopolar spindle for-mation, and loss of centrosomes, leading us to propose a require-ment for Vhl to promote degradation of incorrectly folded tubulinin the absence of functional Prefoldin. Thus, Vhl may play a pivotalrole: promoting microtubule stabilization when tubulins are cor-rectly folded by Prefoldin and tubulin destruction when they are not.folding | chaperone | Gim | E3 ubiquitin ligaseEukaryotes have a complex molecular machinery that promotesthe folding and assembly of the actin and tubulin subunitsof microfilaments and microtubules (MTs). Several proteincomplexes and ancillary proteins are involved in assembling\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers: chaperonin containing tailless protein (CCT),the prefoldin complex, phosducin-like CCT regulatory proteins,and five cofactors [reviewed by Lundin et al. (1)]. Prefoldin isa hexameric protein complex (2) thought to bind to partiallyfolded tubulin and actin molecules from the ribosome (3\u20135).One component of the prefoldin complex also interacts withthe tumor suppressor Von Hippel Lindau (Vhl) protein and isknown as Von Hippel Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1) (6). TheVhl protein is a multifunctional adapter protein that influencesmultiple transcriptional pathways (for review, see refs. 7 and 8),as well as the functions of the collagen IV and fibronectin ex-tracellular matrix and MTs. Its best-characterized function is ina complex with Cullin2 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase thattargets hypoxia-inducible factor \u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) for destruction (9, 10).Vhl interacts with the CCT to mediate the formation of the Vhl-ElonginB/C-Cullin2 complex (VBC) (11\u201315). Therefore, the in-teraction between Vhl and the prefoldin complex could be rele-vant for the folding of the VBC. However, Vhl also interacts withcytoplasmic MTs: in mitosis to influence spindle orientation (16)and in interphase to inhibit catastrophe and promote rescue (17,18). Such an effect could account for the role of Vhl in stabilizingMTs in Drosophila follicle cells to maintain the integrity of thisepithelium (19). Vhl is also required with the GSK-3\u03b2 proteinkinase to maintain the stability of the ciliary axoneme (20\u201322).Genetic studies first identified prefoldin in yeast throughmutants that could still fold tubulin but more slowly (hence thename GIM: genes involved in microtubule biogenesis) (23). Lossof prefoldin in Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal because of a highdemand for tubulin in mitotic cells in the embryo (24). In plants,prefoldin 6 has been shown to be required for normal MTdynamics and organization (25). Knockout of Prefoldin 1 ormutation in Prefoldin 5 of mice lead to a variety of defectscharacteristic of tubulin functions in cilia or in the CNS (26, 27).We now identify merry-go-round (mgr), a Drosophila geneidentified over two decades ago, as encoding the prefoldin 3(Pfdn3)/VBP1/Gim2 subunit. We show that the characteristicmonopolar mitotic spindles of this mutant arise because of di-minished levels of tubulin subunits. We also show that mgrmutants cannot stabilize tubulin following overexpression ofa tubulin transgene. Finally, our studies show that Mgr canphysically interact with Vhl. Moreover, depletion of Vhl rescuesthe destabilization of tubulin resulting from loss of Mgr. Thisfinding leads us to suggest that the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligaseproperties of Vhl may be required for the degradation of in-correctly folded tubulin, suggesting that Vhl can also contributeto MT dynamics through the regulation of tubulin degradation.ResultsMgr Is a Subunit of the Highly Conserved Gim Complex/Prefoldin. Themgr gene was originally recovered as an X-ray\u2013induced mutantresulting in lethality late in development associated with circularmitotic figures in larval neuroblasts (28). We confirmed thisphenotype by immunostaining the CNS to reveal MTs and cen-trosomal antigens in several mutant alleles of mgr and by countingproportions of cells at different stages of mitosis (Fig. 1 A and B,Author contributions: N.

The prometaphase-like cells in suchpreparations could have bipolar spindles that may lack one orboth centrosomes or monopolar spindles having one or twocentrosomes at the single pole (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 A and B).These centrosomes were positive for several known Drosophilacentrosomal antigens (Fig. S1B). The mitotic index was elevatedsome twofold over that in wild-type larval brains and the ratio ofmetaphase:anaphase figures was elevated by two- to threefoldover wild-type, depending upon the allelic combination (Fig. 1B).Taken together, these data are indicative of a delay in pro-gression through the mitotic cycle. Previous phase-contrastimages of spermatocytes of mgr mutants suggested the absenceof meiotic spindles (28). To determine whether this suggestionwas correct, we used an antibody recognizing both the \u03b21-tubulinisoform and the \u03b22-tubulin male germ-line\u2013specific isoform toimmunostain the testes of mgrl4/mgr5 transheterozygotes, a stronghypomorphic mutant combination that shows pharate lethalitybut gives some sterile adults. This process revealed thatmgrl4/mgr5had sufficient MTs to permit the premeiotic mitosis (arrowheadsand magnification in Fig. 1C). However, mature (white dashedoutlined cysts) but not young primary spermatocyte cysts hadreduced MTs (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C) such that the meiotic spin-dles were either absent or highly abnormal (Fig. 1D). Westernblotting with antibodies specific for \u03b1-tubulin, \u03b21-tubulin, and \u03b22-tubulin (29) showed that the levels of all three tubulins were re-duced in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant testes (Fig. 1E), thus accounting forthe spindle defects.To understand why reduction in levels of the mgr gene productmight have such an effect on tubulin levels, we set out to identifythe mgr gene product. Small deficiencies [Df(3R)thoR1, Df(3R)pros235, and Df(3R)pros640] (30), which each fail to complementmgr, placed the mgr gene to 86E4 in a region containing 14predicted genes (Fig. S2 A and B). Using a combination of RNAito identify mitotic phenotypes resulting from the knockdown ofeach of these genes (Fig. S2 C\u2013F) together with the sequencingof candidate genes from chromosomes carrying mgr mutantalleles, we identified the predicted gene CG6719 as mgr. Weconfirmed its identity by showing that lethality of mgrl4/mgr1mutant, a combination showing pharate lethality, could be res-cued with a CG6719 transgene. In addition to the mitotic phe-notype, RNAi-mediated knockdown of mgr led to a reduction ofcytoplasmic MTs in interphase cells (Fig. S2G).Sequencing of the mgr mutant alleles revealed them to repre-sent a variety of deletion, frame-shift, and nonsense mutations(Fig. S2H and SI Materials and Methods). In this study we focusedon two mutant alleles:mgrl4, a null mutant having a deletion in the5\u2032UTR; and mgr5, which because of a nonsense mutation, pro-duces a truncated protein (not detectable by Western blot) andadditionally carries a 41-bp deletion in its 3\u2032UTR. Immunostain-ing on wild-type cells using the anti-Mgr antibody we generatedshowed that the protein localizes throughout the cytoplasm intestis, brain, and cultured cells at all cell-cycle stages (Fig. S3).Western blots on protein extracts of testes and larval CNS con-firmed that the protein was not detectable in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants(Fig. 1F). The sequence of mgr revealed it to encode a subunit ofthe Gim/prefoldin complex; Mgr shows 37% amino acid identitywith its yeast homolog PAC10 and 57% with its human homologVBP1/Pfdn3/Gim2. Thus, the phenotypes of mgr mutants wouldbe consistent with the improper folding and degradation of tubulinin the absence of the Prefoldin complex. The greater reductions intubulin levels in the testes than in the CNS would account for thestronger phenotype in the spermatocytes (Fig. 1F).Spindle Abnormalities Result from Tubulin Destabilization FollowingMgr Depletion. To gain further insight into how Mgr depletionaffects spindle formation, we turned to RNAi in the DMEL-2Drosophila cell line (Fig. 2). Transfection with mgr dsRNA for6 d increased the proportion of cells with monopolar spindlessimilar in appearance to those seen in mgr mutant neuroblastsand greatly above the background level of mitotic abnormalitiestypical of this cell line (Fig. 2 A and B).

Codepletion of BubR1 orMad2 and Mgr led to a decrease of abnormal spindles and arestoration of a normal mitotic index compared with mgr RNAialone (Fig. S4). These results suggest that cells are delayed inmitotic progression after Mgr depletion in response to the spindleassembly check point. To determine whether spindle abnormali-ties were related to centrosome defects, we counted Dplp+ punc-tae in interphase cells after the same period of Mgr depletion.This process revealed a progressive loss of centrosomes fromcells lagging behind the appearance of spindle defects such that40% of cells had no centrosomes by day 12 (Fig. 2 C and D). Thislag in the loss of centrosomes could be because of either or bothdefects in centrosome duplication or segregation as a conse-quence of the spindle defects. To address whether Mgr depletionaffected centriole structure, we carried out electron microscopy,which revealed abnormalities typical of centriole duplication/formation defects; 20% of the centrioles were incomplete andcomposed of singlet MTs rather than doublets or triplets, as incontrol cells (Fig. 2E).Immunoblotting revealed that Mgr depletion led to a reduc-tion in \u03b2-tubulin levels by \u223c70% (Fig. 2F), also apparent byimmunofluorescence (Fig. S2G). Depletion of the Pfdn4 Pre-foldin subunit also led not only to a similar reduction in \u03b2-tubulin, but also in Mgr levels, indicating the importance ofinteractions between subunits of the complex for its stability.Levels of \u03b3-tubulin were reduced by \u223c50%, whereas actin wasunaffected (Fig. S5 A and B). To determine whether the spindleand centrosome defects resulting from Mgr depletion might re-flect the reduction in tubulin levels, we performed partial de-pletion of \u03b2- and \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. 2 G\u2013K and Fig. S5 C\u2013J). DMEL-2 cells were treated with varying amounts of \u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulindsRNA and assayed for spindle defects and centrosome numbersafter 6 d. An increase in monopolar and disorganized spindlesand in centrosome loss mirrored the extent of \u03b2- and \u03b3-tubulinknockdown. However, only the \u03b2-tubulin knockdown recapitulatedthe small spindle size observed after mgr RNAi (Fig. S5D).Moreover, \u03b3-tubulin knockdown leads to a population of bipolarspindles with the centrosomes at one pole only (Fig. S5E), whichwas not observed after mgr RNAi or partial depletion of \u03b2-tu-bulin. Thus, the mitotic defects that follow loss of Mgr appear tobe largely a consequence of tubulin destabilization. To assess ifthe structural defects observed on the centrioles after mgr RNAiwas a consequence of \u03b1\u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulin depletion, we carried outelectron microscopy in cells partially depleted for 6 d for \u03b2- or\u03b3-tubulin. These analyses failed to reveal any centriolar structuraldefects in either case (Fig. S5 I and J). However, the difficulties inassessing the level and timing of \u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulin depletion thatwould be equivalent to that seen following mgr RNAi, togetherwith the restricted numbers of centrioles that can be observed byelectron microscopy in such experiments, makes it difficult toreach a firm conclusion about the effects on centrioles.Levels of Free \u03b1\u03b2-Tubulin Sensitize Mgr Activity. The above studiesshowed that MTs of different tissues present different sensitivityto reduced Mgr levels (Fig. 1). Moreover, even in mgr testes,where disruption of the MT network is most pronounced, it onlyoccurs once primary spermatocytes have reached a late stage intheir development.

This findingsuggests that the onset of synthesis of the \u03b22-tubulin testes spe-cific isoform in late spermatogenesis might bring a particularrequirement for Mgr (31, 32). If this were the case, we wonderedwhether increased synthesis of \u03b21-tubulin from a transgene mighttrigger a stronger requirement for Mgr in larval neuroblasts (Fig.3). We found that in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant neuroblasts the level ofendogenous \u03b2-tubulin was only slightly reduced (by 25% com-pared with wild-type levels). The additional expression of \u03b21-tubulin\u2013GFP did not drastically affect endogenous \u03b2-tubulinlevels if one wild-type copy of mgr was present (mgr5/+;\u03b21-tubulin\u2013GFP, a reduction of 15% compared with wild-type).However, in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants, expression of \u03b21-tubulin\u2013GFPleads to a further decrease in levels of endogenous \u03b2-tubulin by60% compared with wild-type levels (Fig. 3 A and B). There wasalso a dramatic loss ofMT staining in immunostained preparationsof the larval CNS of such organisms (Fig. 3C). Taken together,these results suggest that if tubulin levels exceed a certain thresh-old, this overproduced tubulin may change the complex balance offolding, causing a synthetically lethal phenotype with mgr.A 5mgr5mgrl4;;Ctrl\u03b2-tubGFPWT mgrl4mgr5 \u03b2tub-GFP\u03b2tub-GFP\u03b2tub-GFP\u03b2tub GFPmgr+;;C\u03b2tub-GFP;mgr5/+\u03b2tub-GFP;mgr5/mgrl4mgr5/mgrl4WT% of \u03b2-tubulin levels relative to control020406080100WT \u03b2tub-GFP;mgr5mgrl4mgr5+\u03b2tub-GFP;mgr5mgrl4B\u03b2-tubulin14850Fig. 3.

Several lines of evidence in-dicated that Mgr was able to interact with Drosophila Vhl andthat both proteins could interact with tubulin monomers anddimers. First, beads carrying Maltose binding protein (MBP)-Mgror MBP-Vhl fusion proteins synthesized in bacteria could bind35S-labeled Mgr or Vhl synthesized by coupled transcription-translation in vitro (Fig. 4A). This experiment also indicated thatboth proteins could undertake self-self interactions. Second,both Mgr and Vhl synthesized in bacteria were able to bind35S-labeled \u03b21-tubulin synthesized by coupled transcription-translation in vitro (Fig. S6 A and B). Conversely \u03b21-tubulinsynthesized in bacteria would interact with 35S-labeled Vhl orMgr (Fig. S6 C and D). Third, MBP-tagged Mgr or MBP-taggedVhl immobilized on beads directly bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers (Fig.4 B and C). Fourth, we were unable to disrupt a complex formedbetween bacterially expressed MBP-Vhl and 35S-labeled Mgr byadding dimeric \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (Fig. 4D). Instead the Vhl:Mgr com-plex also bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer. However, whereas DrosophilaVhl, like mammalian Vhl, could interact with MTs (Fig. S6 E andF), Mgr could not. This finding suggests that Mgr can interactwith free, but not with polymerized, tubulin.To test whether the interaction between Vhl and Mgr playedany part in the control of tubulin degradation, we asked what theconsequences would be if Mgr and Vhl were to be codepleted.Vhl RNAi alone had little effect on the levels of \u03b2-tubulin incultured cells (Fig. 4 E and F), confirming the recent finding ofDuchi and colleagues (19). Moreover, Vhl depletion resulted inonly a slight increase in the proportion of mitotic cells withmonopolar or disorganized spindles or lacking centrosomes (Fig.4 G\u2013J). In contrast, Mgr depletion resulted in a clear decrease in\u03b2-tubulin levels, formation of monopolar/disorganized spindlesin the majority of mitotic cells, and an increase of the number ofcells without centrosomes. We found all three of these pheno-types were significantly rescued by the codepletion of Vhl (Fig. 4E and J). Thus, the proteolytic destruction of tubulin, which takesplace when tubulin cannot be correctly folded by the Prefoldinchaperone, requires the function of the Vhl protein.DiscussionThe finding that the Drosophila merry-go-round gene encodesa subunit of the Prefoldin complex has allowed us to account foraberrant structure and function of spindles and centrosomes incells depleted of its gene product. The inability to correctly foldtubulins in Prefoldin-deficient cells leads to tubulin instabilityand, hence, defects that can be phenocopied by depleting \u03b2- or\u03b3-tubulin. However, whereas \u03b2-tubulin depletion phenocopied allof the defects observed, \u03b3-tubulin depletion only recapitulatedsome of them. The more dramatic phenotypes seen in Mgr-de-ficient cells expressing high levels of tubulin (primary spermato-cytes and neuroblasts expressing a \u03b2-tubulin transgene) suggestthat the Prefoldin complex is critical to maintain tubulin levelsabove a certain threshold of tubulin expression. This finding couldbe a consequence of the impact of an excess of tubulin upon itscomplex folding pathway. Interestingly, in mammalian cells, in-creased soluble tubulin, in response to a MT-destabilizing agent,leads to the rapid degradation of tubulin (33, 34). In Drosophila,tubulins in the testes are the most affected by the absence ofMgr compared with other tissues. Indeed, it may be of particularimportance to regulate tubulin levels at the late stages ofspermatogenesis, where the very large meiotic cells are providedwith proportionally large amounts of tubulin that are used in themeiotic spindle but have a major additional purpose: the buildingof the sperm tail. Similarly, in the mouse, the effects of depletionor mutation of prefoldin subunits are largely restricted to thebrain, where tubulin levels are also very high (26, 27). Whetherthis tissue specificity is a consequence of tubulin levels will be aninteresting question to address. Finally, our demonstration thatVhl is required for tubulin destruction in the absence of Mgr andthe ability of Vhl to interact with tubulin monomers and dimersraises the possibility that its role as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligasecould come to play in regulating tubulin levels.The idea that Vhl and Prefoldin can cooperate in regulatingprotein stability was also raised by Mousnier et al. (35), whoidentified the prefoldin subunit VBP1 as a binding partner of theHIV-1 viral integrase and suggested this mediated the interactionof the integrase with the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase. Thisfinding led these authors to suggest a role for prefoldin at a pivotalpart of the pathway that would determine whether a protein waspassed on to the CCT chaperonin for folding or to the protea-some for degradation (35). Similarly, we can speculate that pre-foldin as a partner of Vhl may well serve a key role in regulatingthe equilibrium between tubulin targeted for destruction or forfolding and incorporation into MTs. The concentration of as-sembly-competent tubulin must be tightly controlled because itaffects cytoskeletal dynamics. Vhl might contribute to this in-fluence by an effect on MT dynamics through interaction withMAPs on the MT lattice (17, 18) and by intervening in the reg-ulation of tubulin folding. There is growing evidence for a criticalfunction of Vhl in stabilizing cytoplasmic MTs (16, 17) and axo-nemal MTs in response to levels of soluble tubulin (36). Re-ciprocally, MT stability can contribute to regulating levels ofproteins that are targets of the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase, suchas the HIF proteins, the levels of which fall when their mRNAsaccumulate in cytoplasmic P-bodies for translational repressionfollowing MT disruption (37). It will be important in future toconsider the roles played by the Prefoldin complex and Vhl tounderstand the interrelationships between the machinery regu-lating tubulin levels in relation toMT stability, both in normal andtumor cells.Materials and MethodsBriefly, testes from pupae and CNS from third-instar larvae were dissected inPBS andfixedwithmethanol before proceeding to immunostaining. Culturedcells were pre-extracted before fixation with paraformaldehyde andimmunostaining. Depletion of proteins in cultured cells was performed bytransfection of dsRNA with transfast reagent. Protein extracts were obtainedafter homogeneization of cells, CNS or testes in lysis buffer. Protein inter-actions were tested in vitro using either recombinant commercially availabletubulins (Cytoskeleton), proteins produced in bacteria, or proteins translatedin reticulocyte lysate.A more detailed description of gene constructs, cell culture, immunocy-tochemistry, dsRNA, microscopy, protein purification, Western blot analysis,in vitro binding assays, fly genetics, and primers list can be found in the SIMaterials and Methods and Table S1.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
