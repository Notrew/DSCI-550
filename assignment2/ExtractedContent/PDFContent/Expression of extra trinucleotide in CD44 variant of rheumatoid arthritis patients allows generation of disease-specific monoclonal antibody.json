We generated monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) that exclusively bind, at concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 mg/ml, to a modified CD44 variant (designated CD44vRA) expressed onsynovial fluid cells from joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. These mAbs cross-reacted with keratinocytes expressing wild typeCD44vRA (CD44v3ev10) only at a relatively high concentration (200 mg/ml). Sequence analysis of CD44vRA cDNA revealed, in 33 out of43 RA and psoriatic arthritis patients, an extra intron-derived trinucleotide, CAG, which allows translation of an extra alanine. This insertionimposes a configurational change on the cell surface CD44 of RA synovial fluid cells, creating an immunogenic epitope and potentiating theability to produce disease-specific antibodies. Indeed, the anti-CD44vRA mAbs (designated F8:33) were able to induce apoptosis in synovialfluid cells from RA patients, but not in peripheral blood leukocytes from the same patients, in keratinocytes from normal donors or in synovialfluid cells from osteoarthritis patients. Furthermore, injection of anti-CD44vRA mAbs reduced joint inflammation in DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis. These findings show that anti-CD44vRA mAbs are both bioactive and RA-specific.\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of drugs or technologiescapable of targeting cells involved in pathological activities,while leaving the normal cells intact and functioning, wouldbe a stunning victory for medical science.One way to cope with this challenge is to screen cancer orinflammatory cells for cell surface structural entities expressedon the cells engaged in pathological functions, but not onmailto:naord@md.huji.ac.ilwww.elsevier.com/locate/jautimm100 I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113normal cells involved in physiological activities. Specific tar-geting agents (e.g., antibodies or competitive peptides) recog-nizing such hypothetical structures or their counter molecules,should selectively neutralize the cells implicated in patholog-ical functions, with minimal side effects. Although in the pastthree decades efforts have been made to identify such disease-specific cell surface entities, the results are disappointing,especially from the patient\u2019s view.The targeting of CD44 molecule and its ligand provides,however, new opportunities in establishing specific therapiesfor cancer and inflammatory diseases. CD44 is a cell surfaceglycoprotein involved in many vital normal bioactivities, in-cluding interaction between cells and extracellular tissues,support of cell migration in the blood vessels and inside thetissues, presentation of growth factors, cytokines, chemokinesand enzymes to other cells or to the surrounding tissues, aswell as signal transmission from the cell surface to the interiorof the cell, leading to programmed cell death or cell survivaland proliferation [1,2]. While hyaluronic acid (HA) is the prin-cipal ligand of CD44, this receptor can interact with manyother cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) components[1e3]. Cells involved in pathological activities use CD44 tomaintain at least some of the above-mentioned functions, butwith destructive outcomes. For example, in a normal setting,cell surface CD44 supports the migration of inflammatorycells from the blood circulation toward sites of bacterial infec-tion [4], resulting in the killing of the bacteria. Under patho-logical conditions, CD44 can support the migration ofmetastatic cells from the site of the primary tumor growth toremote organs or the migration of auto-destructive inflamma-tory cells to potential sites of inflammation [1,5]. We andothers have shown in animal models that monoclonal anti-bodies (mAbs) against CD44 can markedly reduce the patho-logical activities of malignant lymphoma [6], juvenile diabetes[5], collagen-induced arthritis [7,8], experimental colitis [9]and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (analogous to hu-man multiple sclerosis) [10], possibly by interfering with cellmigration or inducing apoptosis in the target cells. However,such anti-CD44 mAbs can simultaneously target normal cellsexpressing CD44, causing damage to essential biologicalfunctions.CD44, however, is not a single molecule. The genomicstructure of CD44 includes five constant exons at the 50 end,five (or four) constant exons at the 30 end and 10 (mouse) or9 (man) variant exons inserted between the two constant exons(Fig. 1A). Alternative splicing, can theoretically generate bydifferential utilization of the 10 (or 9) variant exons over800 isoforms [11], of them a few dozen have been already dis-covered. Direct splicing of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16(Fig. 1A), skipping the entire variable region, generates themost ubiquitous isoform-standard CD44 (CD44s), predomi-nantly expressed on hematopoietic cells [3]. Modifications inthe alternative splicing regulation, either genetically inherited,or induced, for example, in the stressed pathological site, mayfurther enrich the molecular diversity of CD44 by giving riseto CD44 variants (CD44v) with extra sequences illegitimatelytranscribed from the end of an intron adjacent to junction sitesof the alternative splicing [12]. Such a mechanism may gener-ate exclusive CD44 variants expressed on cells engaged inpathological activities, i.e., disease-specific CD44 molecules.The present communication describes disease-specific CD44variant expressed on synovial fluid cells of rheumatoid arthri-tis patients (designated CD44vRA). The inclusion of extra tri-nucleotide in CD44vRA allows translation of an extra alanine,resulting in the generation of novel immunogenic epitope,which enabled the production of functional anti-CD44vRAmAb. This anti-CD44vRA mAb can induce apoptosis in syno-vial fluid cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but notin peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from the same patients.2. Materials and methods2.1. PatientsFifty-five patients (30e75 years old) were included in ourstudy, of them 35 with RA, eight with psoriatic arthritis(PSA) and 12 with osteoarthritis (OA). The patients hadbeen diagnosed with RA, PSA or OA according to the Amer-ican College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients treatedwith anti-TNFa reagents were excluded from this study. Allpatients in this study underwent an arthrocentesis of the joint,owing to acute synovitis. Institutional ethics committeeapproval and written informed consent were obtained beforeany protocol specific procedures were undertaken.2.2. Cloning and transfection of human CD44vRA,CD44v3ev10 and CD44sFor cloning human CD44vRA cDNA, the total synovialfluid cell population of RA patients undergoing joint aspirationwas isolated. RNA was separated with a commercial kit(Promega, Madison, WI), CD44vRA cDNA was prepared byRT-PCR (PTC-100\ufffd Programmable Thermal Controller; MJResearch, Watertown, MA), using primers representing theconstant coding regions of CD44 (see Fig. 1A): Ex1-sense,50-GAATTCGCCGCCACCATGGACAAGTTTTGGTGG-30;Ex20-antisense, 50-TCTAGATTACACCCCAATCTTCATG-30.PCR product size was confirmed by agarose gel electro-phoresis, sequencing (ABI PRISM 310, Perkin-Elmer, Well-esley, MA) or PstI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA)digestion (the nucleotide insertion in CD44vRA introducesa PstI digestion site). The PCR product was excised fromthe gel, purified and subcloned into the pGEM vector (Prom-ega). Positive clones were selected by white/blue screening.Plasmids were purified with a commercial kit (Promega),subjected in EcoRI/Xbal-double digestion and cloned intothe pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in whichthe gene product was expressed. The plasmid was transfectedinto the CD44-negative Namalwa Burkett lymphoma cell line(ATCC, Manassas, VA) as described [13]. For cloning ofhuman CD44v3ev10, RNA was isolated from human kerati-nocytes (a gift from Dr. Ben-Basat, Hadassah UniversityHospital, Jerusalem), and for cloning of human CD44s,RNA was isolated from the HeLa cervical cancer cell line101I.

Schematic description of the CD44 molecule and the trinucleotide CAG inclusion in the CD44v3ev10 variant of RA patients. (A) A schematic diagram ofthe CD44 genomic map. The black squares represent the constant exons (designated C1, C2, etc.) at the two ends of the molecule. The white squares represent thevariant exons (designated v2, v3, etc.) subjected to alternative splicing. Differential utilization of the variant exons generates the different CD44 isoforms, e.g.,utilization of exons v3ev10 in tandem forms the CD44v3ev10. Note that exon v1 is not included in human CD44. Arrows mark the positions and directionsof exon 1 sense and exon 20 antisense primers used to isolate the CD44 transcripts, as well as the hs50, hs 30 and pv3I primers (for sequence, see Section 2)used in the RT-PCR described in B. (B) RT-PCR analysis of synovial fluid cells from RA patients. RT-PCR of total RNA derived from synovial fluid cells ofsix RA patients and keratinocytes from one donor (marked with K). Primers hs50/hs30 were used to detect the CD44s transcripts (571 bp). The faint signals at1714 bp represent the CD44v3ev10 transcripts, which are dominated by CD44s transcripts. To see the CD44v3ev10 transcripts (1111 bp) more clearly weused the pv3I/hs30 primers (see A). N-positive control: Namalwa cells expressing CD44vRA.

(C) The entire nucleotide and amino acid sequences of CD44vRA exons v4 and v5 with alignment to the correspondingCD44v3ev10 wild type sequences derived from normal human primary keratinocytes. CAG and alanine inclusion in CD44vRA sequence are shown in bold letters.(obtained from ATCC), using the above-described protocol.Transfection of CD44vRA, CD44v3ev10 and CD44s cDNAsas well as of the pcDNA3.1 vector (\u2018\u2018empty vector\u2019\u2019) wasperformed as described above. Accordingly, the transfectedNamalwa cells were designated Namalwa-CD44vRA,Namalwa-CD44v3ev10, Namalwa-CD44s and Namalwa-Neo,respectively.2.3. Preparation of soluble hCD44v3ev10,hCD44vRA and hCD44s plasmidsThe soluble CD44v3ev10 cDNA was cloned from totalRNA of primary human keratinocyte by RT-PCR amplifica-tion, using two primers assigned from the published CD44 se-quence: Ex1s, 50-TATCTAGAGCCGCCACCATGGACAAGTTTTGGTGG-30; Ex16/17as, 50-TATCTAGAGCCATTCTGGAATTTGGGGTGT-30.Both primers contained a Xbal recognition site. The PCRproducts were digested with Xbal enzyme and pCXFc zeovec-tor was digested with NheI enzyme. After digestion, the PCRproducts were ligated into the pCXFc zeovector to generateCD44v3ev10-immunoglobulin (Ig)-Fc recombinant. Usingthe same protocol, the soluble CD44vRA and soluble CD44scDNAs were cloned from synovial cells of a rheumatoid ar-thritis patient. The soluble CD44 fragments were assignedfrom the published sequence of CD44 (1e1824 bases) [14].2.4. Transient transfection of the soluble CD44plasmids into 293T cellsA quantity of 3 mg of each one of the above-indicated Fccontaining plasmids was incubated for 20 min with 12 ml ofFuGene 6 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Themixture was added into 15 cm cell plates containing 70%102 I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113confluent of 293T cells. Supernatant was collected after 48 hand 72 h. The CD44-IgFc fragmented proteoglycans werepurified on protein-G column and analyzed for correctnessby SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody recognizinga constant epitope shared by all CD44 isoforms, designatedanti-pan-CD44 (or anti-CD44s) mAb (Hermes-3 derivedfrom American Type Culture Collection, ATCC).2.5. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR)RNA was extracted from synovial fluid cells of RA patients,primary human keratinocytes or Namalwa-CD44vRA cells,using RNA-BEE reagent (RNA isolation solvent, Tel-Test,Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions. Reverse transcription was performed with 5 units ofAMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 20 ml reaction vol-ume containing 50 mM TriseHCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCL,10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 unitsRNasin (Promega), using 500 ng of RNA and 100 ng of oligod(T)18 primer (Promega). Reaction samples were incubatedfor 1 h at 41 \ufffdC and then the reverse transcriptase wasinactivated by heating the mixture for 10 min at 65 \ufffdC. Theamplification was performed in a micro-processor-controlledincubator (MiniCycler\ufffd, MJ Research), using 0.5 ml of thereverse transcriptase reaction product (cDNA) in a final volumeof 50 ml containing 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mMTriseHCl, pH 9.0, 250 mM dNTPs and 2.5 units Taq DNApolymerase (Promega). The following primers (see Fig. 1A)were added to reaction mixture: hs 50 sense, 50-GATGGA-GAAAGCTCTGAGCATC-30; pv3I sense, 50-ACGTCTTCAAATACCATCTC-30; hs 30 antisense, 50-TTTGCTCCACCTTCTTGACTCC-30.The CD44 amplification was carried out for 30 cycles withdenaturation at 94 \ufffdC for 1 min, annealing at 50 \ufffdC for 1 minand extension at 72 \ufffdC for 2 min, followed by 10 min final ex-tension at 72 \ufffdC. The amplified products were resolved on1.5% agarose gel. Determination of the cellular CD44 isoformtranscripts was based on the position of the bend in relation tothe markers\u2019 ladder, and on the expected bp size of the differ-ent CD44 variants.2.6. Generation of monoclonal antibodysecreting hybridomasThirty mer CD44vRA peptide (SNPEVLLQTTTRM-TANPSHSNPEVLLOTTT) obtained from Corixa (Seattle,WA) and/or 100 mg/ml soluble CD44vRA produced in our lab-oratory, both emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA)(Sigma, St. Louis, MD), were used to immunize subcutane-ously or intramuscularly 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice.The immunization was repeated on days 14 and 28 and 2weeks later the mice were bled and their sera were tested byflow cytometry for their ability to bind to Namalwa cellsexpressing CD44. The animals with highest polyclonal anti-CD44 antibody titers were selected and boosted intraperitone-ally (i.p.) with 108 Namalwa-CD44vRA cells. After 72 h,spleen cells were harvested and fused with SP 2/0 myelomacells according to Kohler and Milstein [15]. After 1 day of in-cubation in enriched RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing L-gluta-mine, PeneStrep solution, sodium pyruvate and MEM-Eaglenon-essential amino acids (Biological Industries, Bet-Haemek,Israel) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) the hybrid-omas were grown in ClonaCell\ufffd-HY Hybridoma SelectionMedium (medium D, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,BC). Between days 10e14, separated hybridoma colonieswere collected from the semi-solid agar and grown in 96-well plates (Costar, Milpitas, CA) in enriched RPMI 1640 me-dium containing HAT media supplement (Sigma) and 20% ofFBS. At day 7, the supernatants from isolated hybridomaclones were screened by flow cytometry for their ability tobind to Namalwa-Neo, Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 or Namalwa-CD44vRA cells. Hybridoma whose supernatants bound selec-tively or preferentially to Namalwa-CD44vRA were cloned bylimiting dilution and then recloned for additional three cycles.The isolated hybridoma was maintained in enriched RPMI1640 containing HAT media supplement and 20% FBS. Theisotype of the CD44vRA-positive hybridoma supernatantwas determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) using Clonotype System-HRP (Southern Biotechnol-ogy Associates, Birmingham, Alabama). Monoclonal anti-bodies were partially purified from hybridoma supernatants,using G-protein column.2.7. Flow cytometry analysisA quantity of 106 cells were incubated with 3G5 anti-pan-CD44s (Hermes 3, IgG1; ATCC) F-10-44-2 anti-pan-CD44(known also as anti-CD44s) mAb (IgG2b, Serotec, Oxford,UK), VFF7 anti-CD44v6 mAb (IgG1, Bender MedSystem,Vienna, Austria), anti-CD44v9 mAb (ATCC) or anti-CD44vRAfor 45 min on ice. After extensive washing, the cells were incu-bated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated second-ary anti-Ig antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA)for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed and analyzed witha Flow Cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).2.8. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Polystyrene plates of 96 wells (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark)were coated with purified CD44vRA-IgFc, CD44v3ev10-IgFc, CD44s-IgFc soluble proteins or with BSA (100 mg/ml/well diluted in 100 ml sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0). Afterovernight incubation at 4 \ufffdC, the plate was washed three timeswith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T). Following blocking with 10%milk in PBS at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h, different concentrations ofF8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb or anti-pan-CD44 (Hermes 3)mAb were added to the wells. The plates were incubated at37 \ufffdC for 1 h, washed and a secondary goat anti-mouse poly-valent peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoRe-search, Palo-Alto, CA) was added for an additional 1 h. Theenzyme reaction was developed with 0.04% H2O2 and0.04% o-phenylenediamine in phosphateecitrate buffer, pH103I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e1135.0 and stopped after 20 min by addition of 25 ml 4N H2SO4.The optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm on a micro-plate reader MRX (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) andvalues above 0.1 OD were considered positive.2.9. Western blot analysisCells were lyzed in NP-40 buffer and 100 mg of protein, runon denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF mem-brane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with1% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and in-cubated for 1 h with 1 mg/ml Hermes-3 anti-pan-CD44 mAb,which was obtained from ATCC hybridoma supernatant andpurified on a protein-G column. The blots were rewashed inPBS-T, incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated anti-Ig secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (Jackson Immuno-Research) for 45 min, rewashed in PBS-T and developedwith ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,UK).2.10. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosisApoptosis was induced by culturing 2\ufffd 106 synovial fluidcells from RA patients with different concentrations of anti-CD44vRA mAb or with commercial anti-pan-CD44 mAb di-luted in the serum-free RPMI 1640 for 16 h at 37 \ufffdC in CO2incubator. Synovial fluid cells incubated with 5 mg/ml doxoru-bicin served as a positive control. Peripheral blood leukocytes(PBLs) from the same patients, as well as from synovial fluidcells from OA patients underwent identical treatment with an-tibody. After the antibody treatment the cells were washedonce in PBS and resuspended in 100 ml of annexin V bindingbuffer (Pharminogen, San Diego, CA). Five microliters of fluo-rescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V (Pharmi-gen) and 5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) were added to thecells. The cells were mixed gently and incubated for 15 min atroom temperature in the dark, then diluted with 400 ml bindingbuffer and analyzed by two color flow cytometry (BectonDickinson Inc, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Apoptotic cells were dis-tinguished from normal cells by labeling with annexin V andinclusion of propidium iodide. Events accumulated in thelower right hand side quadrate of the panel represent cells inearly apoptosis, those accumulated in the upper right handside quadrate represent cells in late apoptosis, and those atthe lower left hand side quadrate represent survived cells.2.11. Collagen-induced arthritisGeneration of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice andassessment of inflammation by measuring footpad swellingwere performed as we described previously [7]. Briefly,Type II collagen was injected twice 3 weeks apart, intoDBA/1 mice. The development of joint inflammation was as-sessed by measuring footpad swelling with a micro-caliper inmice marked by numbers, decoded only at the end of the ex-periment, and then assigned to the different groups. Anti-CD44 antibodies (150 mg/injection) were injected at onset ofdisease (when the footpad swelling measurement was>1.7 mm) and then every other day for 12 days. This protocolwas approved by the institute\u2019s Animal Ethics Committee.2.12. Statistical analysisData were analyzed using microcomputer programs forone-way ANOVA, followed by Student\u2019s t-test for unpairedvalues. P< 0.05 was considered significant. The results areexpressed as the mean\ufffd s.e.m. Each experiment was repeatedat least three times, all showing similar results.3. Results3.1. The mRNA of CD44 expressed on synovial fluid cellsof RA patients contains intron-derived extra trinucleotideSynovial fluid cells from RA patients (comprising approx-imately 70% polymorphonuclears and macrophages; theremaining are T and B lymphocytes, Ref. [12]) were isolatedfollowing joint aspiration. Their total RNA was reversedtranscribed and subjected to PCR, using primers representingthe constant coding regions of CD44 (hs 50 and hs 30 inFig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the RT-PCR of samples from synovialfluid cells derived from the joint of six representative RA pa-tients. Two major signals were detected: a fast-migrating band(571 bp) corresponds to CD44s, and a slow-migrating band(1714 bp) corresponds to CD44v3ev10, which is also ex-pressed on keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). As the 1714 bp bands arefaint (they are dominated by the CD44s transcripts), we in-cluded in the RT-PCR a third primer (pv 3I in Fig. 1A), repre-senting a coding region from v3 variant exon, coupled to theantisense constant region primer (hs 30). The 1111 bp bandsrepresent the CD44v3ev10 transcripts (Fig. 1B). These find-ings were confirmed by direct sequencing (not shown).The CD44 variant (CD44vRA or CD44v3ev10) was de-tected in samples of synovial fluid cells derived from all 35RA and eight PSA patients, who were included in the project.Five of 12 samples from synovial fluid cells of OA patients dis-played the CD44v3ev10 variant. Extra trinucleotide (CAG)was detected between exon v4 and exon v5 (Fig. 1) in 27 of35 RA patients and 6 of 8 PSA patients following computerizedalignment versus the wild type variant-CD44v3ev10 describedin Ref. [14] (reported in Ref. [12] and confirmed in Fig. 1C).The wild type variant, CD44v3ev10, was detected in synovialfluid cells of the remainder patients, i.e. 8 of 35 RA patients and2 of 8 PSA patients.

CD44vRA, CD44v3ev10 (derived from humankeratinocytes) and CD44s (derived from HeLa cells) cDNAswere transfected into CD44-negative Namalwa Burkitt lym-phoma cell line. CD44 transfectants expressing high levels ofCD44s, as well as CD44v3ev10 and CD44vRA transfectantsexpressing equal levels of v6-containing CD44 were selected(Fig. 2A). They were designated Namalwa-CD44s, Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 and Namalwa-CD44vRA, respectively. Na-malwa cells transfected with the empty vector were designatedNamalwa-pcDNA3.1 or Namalwa-Neo. C57BL/6 mice wereimmunized with synthetic peptide or soluble CD44vRA, bothincorporated into CFA and challenged with Namalwa-CD44vRA cells (for details, see Section 2). Splenocytes frommice showing the highest concentration of polyclonal anti-CD44v antibodies in their serum were fused with SP 2/0 mye-loma cells.

Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113designated F8:33 or MFI-16-11, were purified on G-protein col-umn. Flow cytometry further revealed that at concentrations of0.2 mg/ml or 0.4 mg/ml (Fig. 2B, Table 1), F8:33 anti-CD44vRAmAb interacts with Namalwa-CD44vRA, but not with the othertransfectants, including Namalwa cells transfected with the wildtype CD44v3ev10 cDNA. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml or higherF8:33 cross-reacts with Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 (Table 1) andat higher concentrations (>100 mg/ml) e with Namalwa-CD44sand Namalwa-Neo cells as well (not shown). Isotype-matchedcontrol antibody did not interact, at these concentrations, withthe Namalwa transfectants (not shown). This finding was con-firmed by ELISA: F8:33 mAb bound, in a dose-dependent man-ner, to CD44vRA-coated microwells at higher rates than toCD44v3ev10 or CD44s-coated microwells (Fig. 3A). In contrast,anti-pan-CD44 mAb similarly binds to CD44vRA and CD44v3ev10 (Fig. 3B), while it does not bind to CD44s, presumably due toits inability to recognize the relevant epitope. The molecularmasses of the soluble CD44 proteins were confirmed by Westernblot (Fig. 3C). The isotype of F8:33 is IgG2a, as determined byELISA.3.3. Exclusive targeting of RA synovial fluid cells byF8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAbThe Namalwa transfectants are not, however, the authentictargets for F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb. Rather, the cells donat-ing the transfected CD44vRA and CD44v3ev10 transcripts,i.e., synovial fluid cells and keratinocytes, respectively, shouldbe tested for their ability to interact with this antibody.Flow cytometry analysis revealed slightly higher expressionof CD44s on synovial fluid cells of an RA patient than onkeratinocytes derived from two donors, with variations inexpression of v6-containing CD44. Note that keratinocytes ex-pressing v9-containing CD44 (which is included in CD44v3ev10) at much higher level than RA synovial fluid cells(Fig. 4A). However, at even as wide a range of concentrationsas 2e100 mg/ml, F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb interacts with sy-novial fluid cells from RA patients (Fig. 4B and Table 1), butneither with keratinocytes (Fig. 4B and Table 1) nor or hardlywith synovial fluid cells from OA patients (Fig. 5 and Table 1),as indicated by flow cytometry. Even at as high a concentrationas 100 mg/ml F8:33 selectively bound to RA synovial fluidcells, whereas at a concentration of 200 mg/ml F8:33 cross-reacts with keratinocytes and synovial fluid cells from OApatients (Table 1). Note that the synovial fluid cells were iden-tified as CD44vRA-positive cells by Pstl digestion of theirDNA. Keratinocytes constitutively express CD44v3ev10 (3and our own observations). Next we found that anti-CD44vRAmAbs from two different clones (F8:33 and MFI-16-11)bound, at a concentration of z10 mg/ml, to synovial fluid cellsfrom an RA patient, but they only marginally bound to PBLfrom the same patient or to synovial fluid cells from an OA pa-tient (Fig. 6). Anti-pan-hCD44 mAb (Hermes 3) bound to allthree types of cells and anti-hCD44v6 mAb (recognizingCD44 containing v6 epitope), bound exclusively to synovialfluid cells of OA patients (Fig. 6), emphasizing the specificityof F8:33 and MFi-16-11 binding.3.4. Anti-CD44vRA mAb induces apoptosis in synovialfluid cells of RA patientsDoes the exclusive binding of anti-CD44vRA mAbs deliverany biological signal into synovial fluid cells of RA patients?To challenge this question, we analyzed by two-dimensionalflow cytometry the ability of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb to in-duce apoptosis in synovial fluid cells and PBLs of RA patients.Increasing the dose of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA, gradually in-creased the apoptosis in synovial fluid cells of RA patients, butnot in the PBL of the same patients, as indicated by flow cytom-etry double staining with annexin v and propidium iodide insamples of one patient (Fig. 7A) and by graphical descriptionof such a double staining analysis in samples of a differentpatient (Fig. 7B). Note that the level of apoptosis differsfrom one patient to another, and that the anti-pan-hCD44mAb (Hermes 3) induces apoptosis in synovial fluid cells ofRA patients at the highest concentrations only (Fig. 7).

Notethat the synovial fluid cells of the patients depicted in Fig. 8display relatively high levels of spontaneous apoptosis.3.5. Injection of anti-CD44vRA mAbs attenuatescollagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 miceAlthough the anti-CD44vRA mAbs are human-not mouse-specific and despite the fact that we did not detect CD44vRAin the joints of arthritic DBA/1 mice, we decided to verify theability of F8:33 and MF1-16-11 anti-human CD44vRA mAbsto reduce joint inflammation in DBA/1 mice displayingcollagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Such mice were namedalso arthritic mice. We were prompted to perform this invivo experiment, because anti-human F8:33 bound to spleencells of arthritic mice, significantly increasing apoptosis abovethe spontaneous level. In contrast, this antibody failed to bindto and increase apoptosis in spleen cells from normal mice (re-sults not shown). In this context it should be stressed thatspleen cells from arthritic mice express both CD44s andCD44v3ev10, whereas spleen cells from normal mice expressCD44s only. First, we confirmed our previous finding [7,8]showing that injection of KM81 anti-mouse pan-CD44 mAbat the onset of CIA and then every other day for 12 days, re-duced joint inflammation versus that of similarly treated miceadministered isotype-matched control antibody. Interestingly,injection, under the same experimental protocol, of F8:33 orMFI-16-11 anti-human CD44vRA mAbs reduced also joint in-flammation in the arthritic mice, albeit slightly less effectively(Fig. 9). Further on, we shall discuss our explanation for thiscross reactivity, showing that the anti-CD44vRA mAbs are ef-fective in the animal model of CIA.4. DiscussionWe previously showed that the CD44v3ev10 transcript ofsynovial fluid cells from the joints of RA patients (designatedCD44vRA) contains an extra trinucleotide, CAG, which is not107I.

A representative finding of samples from at least five patients.included in the corresponding wild type molecule, CD44v3ev10, predominantly expressed on primary keratinocytes [12].We now describe the generation of mAbs exclusively recog-nizing CD44vRA and inducing apoptosis in synovial fluidcells from RA patients, but not in their PBLs.The \u2018\u2018illegitimate\u2019\u2019 transcription of the intronic CAGflanking exon v5 of CD44vRA is presumably a consequenceof misregulation of the splicing machinery in this molecule.Unknown genetic or environmental factors or a combinationof both may modify the relative abundance, tissue distribu-tion or activity of serineearginine (SR) or of heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) splicing factors that an-tagonistically control the differential splicing [16]. TheCAG-containing splicing junction may be particularly sus-ceptible to such changes, resulting in the inclusion of CAGin the CD44 mRNA sequence of RA patients. It should bementioned that mutations located in non-coding regions,such as those affecting 50 and 30 splice sites, branch sitesor polyadenylation signals, are frequently (w15%) the causeof genetic diseases [17].The inclusion of CAG in the CD44 mRNA allows insertionof alanine into the translated cell surface CD44 glycoproteinwithout interfering with the reading frame of the entiremolecule. This creates a novel immunogenic epitope that is suf-ficient to allow the production of mAbs (e.g., F8:33 and MFI-16-11) recognizing CD44vRA expressed on synovial fluid cellsof RA patients. The antibodies bound to CD44vRA, coated onmicroplates or expressed on Namalwa cells, at higher intensitythan to the corresponding wild type molecule CD44v3ev10 orCD44s. Notably, CD44vRA and CD44v3ev10 are expressed toa similar extent on Namalwa cells, whereas CD44s is expressedon these cells at an even higher level, indicating that the108 I.

Anti-CD44vRA mAb discriminates between synovial fluid cells from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. Binding of different concentrationsof F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAbs to synovial fluid cells isolated from the joints of RA or OA patients was detected by fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse Ig (secondantibody). The faint histogram in each panel depicts binding of second antibody only.preferential binding of F8:33 to Namalwa-CD44vRA is notquantitatively dictated. The selective binding of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb to Namalwa-CD44vRA was detected at con-centrations\ufffd 0.4 mg/ml. At increasing concentrations, F8:33first cross-reacts with Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 (Table 1) andthen with Namalwa-CD44s (not shown), implying the existenceof a hierarchy in binding affinity, the highest to cell surfaceCD44vRA and the lowest to cell surface CD44s.However, the Namalwa transfectants are, in fact, an artifi-cial model for evaluating the binding capacity and bioactivityof anti-CD44vRA mAbs. To obtain a more realistic assess-ment, the interaction of F8:33 with authentic RA synovial fluidcells and primary keratinocytes was examined. We chosekeratinocytes as a reference group, because they are known ex-pressors of CD44v3ev10 [3,18], the wild type of CD44vRA.Owing to the low frequency of CD44v3ev10-positive RApatients, it is impractical to use synovial fluid cells fromsuch donors. Interestingly, the concentration of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA that was able to discriminate between RA synovialfluid cells and keratinocytes was much higher than thatdiscriminating between Namalwa-CD44vRA and Namalwa-CD44v3ev10. Even at concentrations as high as 100 mg/ml,F8:33 bound exclusively to RA synovial fluid cells. Thisconcentration is close to the anti-arthritic \u2018\u2018therapeuticwindow\u2019\u2019 of infliximab anti-TNF mAb [19], i.e., the highestblood concentration of the antibody, which elicits a therapeuticresponse in a patient, but is not toxic. Anti-TNF mAb iswidely used in the therapy of RA patients [19], but its possiblelong-range deleterious effects are not known.Why does F8:33 discriminate, at high concentrations, be-tween RA synovial fluid cells and keratinocytes, but notbetween Namalwa-CD44vRA and Namalwa-CD44v3ev10model cells? Conceivably, the F8:33 recognizing-epitope, ex-posed to the relevant antibody, is differentially expressed onthe authentic cells and on model cells, resulting in distinctbinding affinities to these two sets of cells. Does expressionof cell surface CD44vRA entail a functional meaning withphysiological or pathological consequences? Namalwa cellsand RA synovial fluid cells expressing CD44vRA and immo-bilizing FGF-2 activate FGF-receptor bearing cells more in-tensively than corresponding cells expressing the wild typeCD44v3ev10 [12]. As activation of the FGF-receptor onfibroblasts and endothelial cells in inflammatory joints ofRA patients is an important factor in the pathology of thedisease [20e22], it is conceivable that CD44vRA expressioncontributes to the RA inflammatory process.Can the exclusive structure of CD44vRA, expressed oninflammatory cells of RA patients, be exploited for selective109I.

Anti-CD44vRA mAbs bind to synovial fluid cells of an RA patient but not to PBLs from the same patient.

The faint histogram in each panel depicts binding of second antibody only. A representative finding of samples from at least 30 patients.therapeutic targeting of these cells? To address this issue, wegenerated anti-CD44vRA mAbs that bound at much higherintensity to synovial fluid cells from RA patients than toPBLs from the same patients, synovial fluid cells from OA pa-tients or keratinocytes from normal donors. Furthermore, theanti-CD44vRA mAb interaction with the CD44vRA receptorof RA synovial fluid cells delivers apoptotic signals to thecell interior, leading to programmed cell death of those cellsinvolved in the destructive inflammatory cascade of the joint.Since the PBLs of the same patients were not affected by thisantibody treatment, a selective therapeutic effect might beobtained in vivo as well. This challenge will be the thrust ofour future studies.It has been well established that the CD44 receptor can di-rectly or indirectly deliver apoptotic [23e25] or survival [26]signals. The nature of the signal is possibly dependent on theisoform of cell surface CD44 (standard or variant) as well ason the type of receptor ligand and its concentration or onthe components of the extra-vascular tissue associated withthe ligand. The presence or absence (e.g., in CD44 knockout mice) of cell surface CD44 or the conditions of receptoractivation dictate the upregulation or the downregulation ofpro-apoptotic (Apaf-1, Bak, Bax, Bid, Hrk, CRADD, cas-pase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9) or anti-apoptotic(A1, phosphorylated BAD, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, phosphoinositide3-kinase, Akt, TANK, OX40, OX40L, TRAF-2 and TRAF-3)genes, leading to programmed cell death or cell survival[27e30]. Apoptotic [23e25,27] or anti-apoptotic (survival)[26] signals can be delivered following engagement of cellsurface CD44 with anti-pan-CD44 mAb [23e27] as well aswith its ligand e hyaluronan [23,26]. In addition, anti-CD44mAb or hyaluronan can inhibit apoptosis induced by otherstimuli, including anti-integrin mAb and therapeutic drugs[31,32]. The apoptotic [23] or anti-apoptotic [26] signals de-livered by anti-CD44 mAb or hyaluronan may be mediatedby Fas upregulation or downregulation, respectively.Targeting of CD44 can attenuate inflammatory-mediateddiseases, owing to apoptosis of CD44-positive inflammatory110 I.

In contrast, in the absence of CD44 (e.g., in CD44 knockout mice), the disease is aggravated because the inflammatorycells are not exposed to CD44-transmitted death signals [33].Conversely, when cell surface CD44 or one of its variants de-livers survival signals, the absence of CD44 allows inductionof apoptosis in the inflammatory cells and disease attenuation.On the other hand, in the presence of CD44 or CD44 variants,the inflammatory cells are preserved and the disease is exacer-bated [34].We suggest that the CD44 receptor of synovial fluid cellsfrom different RA patients (CD44vRA), is committed, owingto a relevant setting (as discussed above) to transmit apoptoticsignals after interaction with anti-CD44vRA mAbs or withcorresponding, yet unknown, natural ligand.

Anti-CD44vRA enhanced apoptosis in synovial fluid cells of a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient but not, or less, in corresponding cells of two osteoarthritis(OA) patients. The apoptotic-inducing capacity of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb and anti-pan-hCD44 mAb was analyzed by two-dimensional flow cytometry asindicated in Fig. 7.circumstances, the concentrations of anti-CD44vRA mAbsthat induced programmed cell death in synovial fluid cells ofRA patients failed to induce or enhance apoptosis in thePBLs of the same patients, while anti-pan-CD44 mAbs-in-duced apoptosis in RA synovial fluid cells only at high con-centrations. Notably, the apoptotic effect induced in RAsynovial fluid cells with anti-CD44vRA mAb was detectedat a concentration as low as 1 mg/ml, whereas at least 10 timeshigher concentrations were required to induce apoptosis withanti-pan CD44 mAbs, as shown by other investigators[23,24,27] and ourselves (Fig. 7).Our anti-human CD44vRA mAb (designated F8:33) en-hances spontaneous apoptosis in spleen cells from arthriticmice, but not in spleen cells from normal mice (not shown).The same F8:33 kills by apoptosis synovial fluid cells fromRA patients, but not PBLs from the same patient (Fig. 7). Inaddition, injection of F8:33, at the onset of CIA, markedlyreduced joint inflammation in arthritic DBA/1 mice (Fig. 9).Obviously this begs the question: how does the anti-humanCD44vRA mAb recognize the CD44 of the arthritic mouse?This enigma appears to be even more complicated, giventhat we were unable to detect the arthritic CD44 variant(CD44vRA) in the joints of arthritic mice (not shown). How-ever, we have found that the spleen cells of arthritic miceexpress CD44v3ev10, whereas spleen cells of normal non-arthritic mice do not express this isoform (but they do expressstandard CD44). The CD44v3ev10 isoform is the wild typemolecule of CD44vRA, i.e. they are identical in sequence,but CD44vRA includes an extra alanine between exon v4and v5, without any change in the rest of the reading frame.We compared the sequence of the splicing junction ends ofv4 and v5 exons in human CD44vRA (where alanine isinserted), human CD44v3ev10 and mouse CD44v3ev10.Surprisingly we found that the sequence of mouse wild typeCD44v3ev10, which is expressed in arthritic mice, but notin non-arthritic mice, contains alanine like human CD44vRA112 I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113(but unlike human CD44v3ev10) in the junction between v4and v5 (see underlined A in the sequences) as shown:Mouse CD44v3ev10; v4/v5 junction: NPRVLLQTTTRMAD IDRISTSAHGENWT,Human CD44v3ev10; v4/v5 junction: NPEVLLQTTTRMTD VDRNGTTATHGNWNP,Human CD44vRA; v4/v5 junction: NPEVLLQTTTRMTAD VDRNGTTATHGNWNP.The remainder of the sequence of human CD44vRA andmouse CD44v3ev10 is similar (but not identical) on bothsides flanking their alanines (see sequences above). Thissequence comparison can explain why anti-human CD44vRAmAb was able to enhance apoptosis in spleen cells from ar-thritic mice and to induce at least partial resistance to CIAin DBA/1 mice.We [5,8] and others [9,10] have shown that a considerablenumber of pathological activities in inflammatory and cancerexperimental diseases are CD44-dependent. Furthermore,there is circumstantial evidence that CD44 is an important fac-tor in the corresponding human diseases as well [1,35]. The in-tensive alternative splicing machinery of the CD44 moleculeprovides opportunities for creating disease-specific targetingstructures that cannot be detected in other pro-inflammatoryor pro-cancerous molecules that are far less subjected to diver-sification mechanism. If sequence variations generated inCD44 alternative splicing junctions are a ubiquitous phenom-enon in CD44-dependent pathologies, specific targeting ofthese modified structures, e.g., by mAbs, may open up new av-enues for specific therapy not only in RA, but also in othercancer and inflammatory diseases.1.51.71.92.12.32.52.72.93.10 2 4 6 8 10 12DaysPaw (mm)Neg.Con.KM81F8:33MF1-16-11Onset ofDiseaseNegativeControln-=10KM81n=7F8:33n=10MF1-16-11n=6* **************** ************Fig. 9.
