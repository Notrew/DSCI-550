Previous reports havecorrelated the level of UEV1A expression with tumorigenesis; however, the detailed molecular events leading totumors particularly breast cancer and metastasis are unclear. This study is to investigate roles of different UEV1 splicingvariants, and its close homolog MMS2, in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells.Methods: We experimentally manipulated the UEV1 and MMS2 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells andmonitored their effects on cell invasion and migration, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in xenograft mice.The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to metastasis were also examined.Results: It was found that overexpression of UEV1A alone, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is sufficient to induce cell invasionin vitro and metastasis in vivo. This process is mediated by NF-\u03baB activation and requires functional Ubc13. Ourexperimental data establish that among NF-\u03baB target genes, UEV1A-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP1) expression plays a critical role in cell invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, experimental depletion of UEV1 inMDA-MB-231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and prevents tumor formation and metastasis in a xenograft mousemodel, while overexpression of MMP1 overrides the metastasis effects in UEV1-depleted cells.Conclusions: These results identify UEV1A as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of metastasic breastcancers.IntroductionUEV1, also known as CROC1 [1] or CIR1 [2], encodes aubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme variant (Uev) [3]. It wasalso identified as a mammalian homolog of yeast MMS2 [4]and as a co-factor of Ubc13 [5]. Indeed, a Uev (Uev1A orMms2) is absolutely required for Ubc13-mediated Lys(K)63-linked polyubiquitin chain assembly [5-9]. Despite theirshared biochemical activity, Mms2 and Uev1A appear tofunction differently in mammalian cells: Ubc13-Mms2 isrequired for DNA-damage responses whereas Ubc13-Uev1A is involved in nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation[10]. Previous studies implicate UEV1 as a potential proto-* Correspondence: wei.xiao@usask.ca1College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China 1000482Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada\u00a9 2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central LtdCommons Attribution License (http://creativecreproduction in any medium, provided the orDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.orunless otherwise stated.oncogene. UEV1 was initially identified as a transactivatorof the c-fos promoter [1]. It is downregulated when HT29-M6 colon cancer cells undergo chemical-induced differenti-ation, and upregulated when Simian virus 40-transformedhuman embryonic kidney cells become immortal [2]. Fur-thermore, UEV1 is variably upregulated in all tumor celllines examined [4], and maps to chromosome 20q13.2 [3],a region where DNA amplification is frequently reported inbreast cancers [11-14] and other tumors [15], as well as invirus-transformed immortal cells [16].Ubc13-Uev1A is involved in NF-\u03baB activation[10,17,18] and inhibits stress-induced apoptosis inHepG2 cells [19]. Very recently, it was reported that asmall-molecule inhibitor of Ubc13-Uev1A interactioncan inhibit proliferation and survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells [20].

It regulates a panel of genes that collectively playpro-survival and anti-apoptotic roles [26,27]. It also controlsthe expression of genes linked with invasion, angiogenesis,and metastasis of cancer, including the matrix metallopro-teinase (MMP) family [28,29] and chemokine (C-X-C motif)ligand (CXCL) family genes [30,31]. Activation of NF-\u03baB isa tightly regulated event. In normal cells, NF-\u03baB becomesactivated only after the appropriate stimulation, and then itupregulates the transcription of its target genes [24]. NF-\u03baBis activated by many divergent stimuli, including proinflam-matory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1b, epidermal growthfactor (EGF), T- and B-cell mitogens and bacterial lipopoly-saccharides (LPS) [32]. Previous studies reported that theUev1A-Ubc13 heterodimer is involved in TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [17,33] and TRAF2-mediated[34] activation of NF-\u03baB, in which Ubc13-Uev1A probablyserves as a unique Ubc/E2 along with TRAF proteins topolyubiquitinate NF-\u03baB essential modulator/inhibitor of \u03baBproteinkinase (NEMO/IKK\u03b3) [18,35] and/or Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1(RIP1) [36] to activate I\u03baB kinase (IKK).Activated IKK leads to the phosphorylation and degradationof I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in the release of NF-\u03baB RelA (p65) sub-units to translocate into the nucleus [37].In this study we demonstrate that in MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells, the UEV1A transcript level is moderately ele-vated compared to normal breast cells. Overexpressionof UEV1A alone in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient toactivate NF-\u043aB, which in turn upregulates the MMP1expression to enhance breast cancer cell metastasis. Moreimportantly, experimental depletion of Uev1 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and reduces their abil-ity to grow tumors and metastasize in a xenograft mousemodel. These observations provide the experimental andtheoretical cornerstone for therapeutic targeting of Uev1Ain the treatment of metastatic breast cancers.MethodsCell cultureHuman breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7,MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-436 and SK-BRIII were obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection (ATCC, Manassan, VA, USA). The cellswere cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum essential medium(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supple-mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicil-lin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. The MCF10A immortalized humanmammary epithelial cells were obtained from ATCC andcultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10%horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml strepto-mycin (Invitrogen), 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,USA), 100 ng/ml choleratoxin (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml hydro-cortisone (Sigma), and 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech). MDA-MB-231-TR stable cell lines were created by transfectingMDA-MB-231 cell lines with pLenti6-TR-lentivirus (Invi-trogen) and selecting with 10 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen).Plasmids and pLentivirus vector preparationHuman MMS2, UEV1A, and UEV1C open reading frames(ORFs) were PCR-amplified as KpnI-XhoI fragments andcloned into the pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) plasmid vector.The 1.9-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence [GenBank:AJ002550.1] was PCR-amplified as a KpnI-HindIII fragmentand then cloned into the same sites of pGL4.2 (Invitrogen).The NF-\u043aB target site was subsequently mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using a quick-exchange method(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Themutated Ubc13-binding site (F38E) in Uev1A was designedbased on a previous study with Mms2-F13E [9]. The modi-fied sequence for UEV1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)delivered by lentiviral particles was from Santa Cruz Bio-technology, Inc (Dallas, Texas, USA). The lentiviral particleinfection of breast cancer cells was performed following in-structions of the supplier. The MMP1 and MMP9 smallinterfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Gene-pharma Co Ltd (Shanghai, China).

Briefly, luciferase reporter gene constructs (400 ng),pcDNA-Uevs plasmids (400 ng) and the pRL-SV40Renilla luciferase construct (5 ng) (for normalization)were co-transfected into the wells. Cell extracts were pre-pared 48 hr after transfection and the luciferase activitywas measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assaysystem (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).Western blot analysisCells were grown to log phase and lysed in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 10 mM NaH2PO4,pH 7.4) with 1% SDS and the protease inhibitor cocktail formammalian cells (Sigma-Aldrich). Total protein concentra-tion was determined by the Bradford method using a com-mercial reagent from Bio-Rad. Cell extracts or purifiedproteins were electrophoresed in 10% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, transferredto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and incubatedwith specific primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) LN2B (anti-Uev1) and 4E11 (anti-Ubc13) werefrom the laboratory stock [10,39]. Primary antibodiesagainst HA (sc-7392), MMP1 (sc-30069), NF-\u03baB (sc-372),Lamin B (sc-166729), \u03b2-tublin (sc-6216), and secondarygoat anti-mouse antibody IgG-horseradish peroxidase(HRP) (sc-2005) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2004)antibody were from Santa Cruz. The P-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody(#2859S) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Whitby,ON, Canada), while an anti-MMP9 antibody (ab38898)was from Abcam (Toronto, ON, Canada) and \u03b2-actin anti-body (BM0627) was from Boster (Wunah, China).ImmunoprecipitationWe immunoprecipitated 1 mg of protein samples in a totalvolume of 1 ml with 2 \u03bcg of antibody and 20 \u03bcl of Protein-A beads (for rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or Protein-Gbeads (for mouse monoclonal antibodies). The samples wererotated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The beads were washed 4 timeswith 1 ml of cold NP40 lysis buffer containing protease in-hibitors. The beads were then boiled for 10 minutes in thepresence of 25 \u03bcl 2 \u00d7 sample buffer and the released proteinsfractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12% or 15% gels. Proteinswere detected by immunoblotting as described above.Cell invasion and migration assaysIn vitro invasion assays were conducted using Transwells(Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 8-\u03bcm-pore-size poly-carbonate membrane filters in 24-well culture plates. Theupper surface of the filter was coated with Matrigel(Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) in a volume of12.5 \u03bcl per filter. The Matrigel was dried and reconstitutedat 37\u00b0C into a solid gel on the filter surface. The lowersurface of the filter was coated in fibronectin (20 \u03bcg/ml),vitronectin (10 \u03bcg/ml), collagen IV (50 \u03bcg/ml), or 10%(BSA)-DMEM as chemoattractants. After starving in BSA-free DMEM overnight, 2 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded in theupper chamber. The cells were allowed to invade for 48 hr.Cells that invaded the lower surface of the filter werecounted in five random fields under a light-microscope athigh magnification. Experiments were conducted at leastin triplicate. The in vitro cell migration ability was detectedby wound healing assay or transwell assay without Matrigelcoating. The wound healing assay was performed by seed-ing 2 \u00d7 105 cells onto 96-well plates. Confluent monolayerswere wounded using a pipette tip. After 48 hr the cell mi-gration distance was measured under a light-microscope athigh magnification in at least three random fields. Thetranswell assay without Matrigel was conducted usingTranswells with 8-\u03bcm-pore-size polycarbonate membranefilters in 24-well culture plates. The lower surface of the fil-ter was coated with 10% BSA-DMEM as chemoattractants.After starving in a BSA-free DMEM medium overnight,5 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded in the upper chamber. Cells wereallowed to invade for 6 to 36 hr and those migrated to thelower surface of the filter were counted in five randomfields under a light-microscope at high magnification. Ex-periments were conducted at least in triplicate.Metastasis assay in a xenograft mouse modelThe experimental mouse work followed the animal careprotocol CNUAREB-2012002 approved by the Capital Nor-mal University Animal Research Ethics Board and was con-ducted at the Peking University Health Science Center,China. For the tumorigenesis assays, 5 \u00d7 106 breast cancercells were injected subcutaneously into the lateral flanks of4- to 5-week-old BALB/c female nude mice. The palpabletumor diameters were measured once per week. Tumorlength (L) and width (W) were measured with a caliper, andthe volume (V) was calculated by the following equation:V \u00bc L\ufffdW2\ufffd \ufffd=2:The mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after cell injection. Forexperimental metastasis assays by intravenous (i.v.) injection,2 \u00d7 105 breast cancer cells were injected into the tail veins ofWu et al.

Metastaticlung nodules 0.5 mm in diameter were counted. Analysisof variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analyses. Toensure representative sampling of lung tumor nodules,four sections were made per lung at various depths alongthe coronal plane of the lung. The nodules per lung (foursections) were counted under a light-microscope.HistopathologyFormalin-fixed lungs were paraffin-embedded, and tissuesections derived from tumor nodules or other tissues werestained with H&E to evaluate the morphology and inva-siveness of breast cancer cells. Metastatic tumor noduleswere counted throughout the entire lung section at allthree depths under a light-microscope. Anti-Uev1A (LN1),anti-MMP1 (sc-30069) and NF-\u03baB p65 (sc-372) primaryantibodies from Santa Cruz were used for immunohisto-chemistry (IHC). TissueFocus\u2122 breast cancer tissue micro-arrays (CT565863) for IHC were obtained from Origene(Beijing, China). Microscopic images were captured by aSPOT digital camera mounted in a light-microscope.Preparation of nuclear fractionHeLa cells were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 2 hr.Cells were washed, scraped with PBS, and centrifuged at3,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was suspended in 10 mMTris (pH 8.0) with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,and 0.1% NP-40, and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Nu-clei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at12,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The cytosolic superna-tants were removed and the precipitated pellets were sus-pended in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCland stored on ice for 30 minutes. After agitation for 30 mi-nutes at 4\u00b0C, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)The secquence of biotin-labelled sense NF-\u03baB probe forEMSA is 5\u2032-GAACCTCAGAGAACCCCGAAGAGCC-3\u2032. The cold probe is the same NF-\u03baB sequence withoutbiotin label. The sequence of biotin-labelled mutatedsense NF-\u03baB probe is 5\u2032-GAA CCTCA AGAGGTTTTGAAGAGCC-3\u2032 (mutated sequence underlined): 1 ng ofthe probe was incubated together with 10 to 20 \u03bcg ofcell extracts or 5 to 10 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts for 30 mi-nutes at 25\u00b0C in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. The bindingreaction was subsequently separated on a 5.5-7% poly-acrylamide gel in 1x Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (90 mMTris, 90 mM boric acid).Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of differential findings betweenthe experimental and control groups was determined byStudent\u2019s t-test as implemented by Microsoft Excel 2010(*P <0.05, **P <0.01 and ***P <0.001).ResultsAlternative UEV1 transcript levels in breast cancer celllines and samplesTwo major human UEV1 transcripts (UEV1A and UEV1B)were previously reported [1]. It was determined that onlyUev1A, but not Uev1B, is able to physically interact withUbc13 and promote K63-linked polyubiquitination [10]. Itturns out that Uev1B is excluded from the nucleus and in-volved in endosomal trafficking [40]. Interestingly, data-base analyses also indicate another splicing variant thatwould encode a 147-amino acid Uev1 core domain, whichwe name Uev1C (Figure 1A), the cellular function of whichis currently unknown.Western blot analysis of endogenous Uev1s using aUev1-specific monoclonal antibody LN2B [39] could onlydetect Uev1C in several breast cancer cell lines includingMDA-MB-231 and MCF7, and MCF10A, an immortalizednormal mammary epithelial cell line (Figure 1B). qRT-PCT analysis revealed that the relative transcript levelof UEV1C is approximately 100-fold higher than that ofUEV1A in the above cell lines (Figure 1C), consistent withobservations in other cell lines including HeLa and U2OS(data not shown).We next examined relative transcript levels of UEV1Aand UEV1C in breast cancer lines using MCF10A as areference. Interestingly, the UEV1A transcript level is ele-vated in all breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure 1D),with no significant upregulation of UEV1C (Figure 1E) orMMS2 (Additional file 2: Figure S1A) in these lines. It hasbeen previously reported that the UEV1A level may be el-evated when normal cells undergo immortalization [2]. Tofurther assess relative UEV1A expression in normal versusbreast tumor tissues, we measured the UEV1A tran-script level in five normal human breast samples and 43breast cancer samples from TissueScan microarrays.Compared with the five normal human breast samples,33/43 or 77% of breast cancer samples display UEV1Aexpression above the highest UEV1A level in normalsamples, or at least 1.7-fold higher than the average levelamong the five normal samples (Additional file 2: FigureS1B), suggesting that Uev1A may play a role in promotingbreast tumorigenesis.Overexpression of UEV1A promotes breast cancer cellinvasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft modelTo ask whether an elevated UEV1A level is indeed suffi-cient to promote breast cancer, UEV1A, UEV1C or MMS2genes were cloned into a pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) vectorand then transfected into MDA-MB-231-TR cells to con-struct stable cell lines, and the level of ecotopic gene ex-pression after 10 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (Dox) treatment wasFigure 1 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (UEV)1A is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples.

The effects of ecotopic genes on breast cancercell migration and invasion were then measured. Thewound-healing experimental data show that the over-expression of UEV1A doubles the mobility comparedwith the same cells without ecotopic UEV1A expressionor vector-transfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells with Doxtreatment, while overexpression of UEV1C or MMS2 doesnot affect cell mobility compared with uninduced cells(Figure 2B, C and Additional file 2: Figure S4). In a trans-well assay, the invasiveness of UEV1A transfectants afterinduction was approximately 2.3-fold higher than theFigure 2 UEV1A overexpression promotes breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft model.

Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 7 of 15http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75control, UEV1C or MMS2 transfectants, whereas therewas no significant difference among control, UEV1C andMMS2 transfectants regardless of Dox treatment (Figure 2Dand E). These results suggest that UEV1A regulates breastcancer cell migration and invasion in vitro.As an increased ability of cancer cells to migrate andinvade in vitro is a faithful indicator of cell metastasis, tofurther confirm the correlation between UEV1A expres-sion and breast cancer metastasis, we assessed the effectsof UEV1A on metastasis using an in vivo xenograft mousemodel. Stably-transfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells wereinjected into the lateral flanks of 4- to 5-week-old BALB/cfemale nude mice and Dox (625 mg/kg) was added infeed as soon as the cells were injected. Tumor growthand metastasis were then monitored. All mice (10/10)injected with the UEV1A-expressing cells had massivelyenlarged lymph nodes containing invasive breast cancercells (Figure 2F). In contrast, there were no tumor metas-tasis foci in lymph nodes of mice injected with vectorcontrol or UEV1C-expressing cells, although some lymphnodes were enlarged (data not shown). Furthermore, over-expression of UEV1A but not UEV1C accelerated tumorgrowth compared to vector-transfected cells (Figure 2G).In the tail-vein injection groups, compared with UEV1Cor vector control, overexpression of UEV1A significantlypromoted lung metastasis colony fomation (Figure 2H,and I). These observations collectively demonstrate thatelevated expression of UEV1A alone is sufficient to pro-mote tumor growth and metastasis.Depletion of Uev1 prevents breast cancer cell invasionin vitro and metastasis in nude miceCompared with MCF-10A cells, there was a 2.7-fold in-crease in the UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells(Figure 1D). To ask whether this moderate overexpressionof UEV1A contributes to breast cancer metastasis, the en-dogenous UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells wassuppressed using an shRNA (shUEV1) delivered by lenti-viral particles. It was found that two independent shUEV1constructs, shUEV1-1 and shUEV1-2, reduced UEV1A ex-pression to 40% and 55% of control shRNA-treated cells,respectively (Figure 3A). As expected, the cellular UEV1CmRNA and protein levels were also reduced but MMS2remained unaffected (Additional file 2: Figure S5A-C).Moreover, partial depletion of Uev1 reduced cell migra-tion (Figure 3B and Additional file 2: Figure S5D) and in-vasion (Figure 3C and Additional file 2: Figure S5E). Theabove findings were further extended by using a xenograftlung metastasis model, in which depletion of Uev1 limitedtumor growth to the extent that no tumor was found innude mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells in which theUev1 level was reduced by shUEV1-2 (Figure 3D andAdditional file 2: Figure S5F). Furthermore, depletion ofUev1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced thenumber of lung nodules formed in mice and completelyabolished metastasis in lung, even with moderate deple-tion of Uev1 (Figure 3E, shUEV1-1, middle panel). Theseresults clearly indicate that the elevated UEV1A expres-sion in MDA-MB-231 cells plays a critical role in breasttumorigenesis and metastasis.Overexpression of UEV1A activates NF-\u03baB in MDA-MB-231cells in a Ubc13-dependent mannerTo understand the mechanism by which Uev1A promotesmetastasis in breast cancer cells, we took into account thatUev1A has been reported to activate NF-\u03baB in HepG2[19], and that NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of a largenumber of genes critical for tumorigenesis, inflammationand metastasis [41]. As a hallmark of NF-\u03baB activation isits translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, wetransfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells with a variety of con-structs, induced the target gene expression by adding Dox,fractionated cells and then measured the subcellular distri-bution of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. As seen in Figure 4A,only overexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2,was able to increase the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baBinhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 (presumably in the cytoplasm) and en-rich p65 in the nucleus. Consistently, depletion of Uev1by shRNA reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and p65 nucleartranslocation (Figure 4B).It has been previously reported that Uev1A is a cofactorof Ubc13 in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [10,17]. To askwhether the above Uev1A function is indeed dependenton Ubc13, we created a Uev1A-F38E mutation as the cor-responding Mms2-F12E mutation (Figure 1A) absolutelyabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 and its ability to pro-mote Ubc13-mediated K63 polyubiquitination [9]. Indeedwe confirmed that the Uev1A-F38E substitution does notaffect its expression (Additional file 2: Figure S2F) butabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 in vivo (Figure 4C).As expected, overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to ac-tivate NF-\u03baB, as judged by a lack of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylationand p65 nucleaar translocation (Figure 4D).MMP1 and MMP9 are tightly regulated by UEV1As NF-\u03baB is a transcriptional factor that regulates theexpression of a large number of genes including thoseinvolved in metastasis, we measured the transcription ofmany established or putative NF-\u03baB target genes thoughtto be involved in metastasis such as COX2 [42], VEGF[43] and MMP family genes, among which MMP1 andMMP9 transcripts were elevated by 4.6- and 3.9-fold, re-spectively, in UEV1A-overexpression cells, but not in UEV1Cor MMS2 overexpression cells (Figure 5A,B), with corre-sponding elevation at proteins levels (Figure 5C). Theobserved increase is completely dependent on Ubc13,as overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to induceMMP1 or MMP9 (Figure 5B). Similarly, depletion ofFigure 3 Depletion of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1 reduces cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft mousemodel.

Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 8 of 15http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75UEV1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced MMP1and MMP9 transcript (Figure 5D) and protein (Figure 5E)levels, and more efficient depletion of UEV1 (shUEV1-1versus shUEV1-2) resulted in stronger repression ofMMP1 and MMP9 expression (Figure 5D and E), in-dicating that MMP1 and MMP9 are tightly regulatedby Uev1A-Ubc13.MMP1 is a downstream effector for Uev1A-inducedmetastasisTo ask whether MMP1 and/or MMP9 are critical ef-fectors for Uev1A-induced metastasis, we depleted MMP1or MMP9 by siRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6A).The above treatment did not affect the UEV1A expression(Figure 6A), but the depletion of MMP1 significantlyFigure 4 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1A activates NF-\u03baB in MDA-MB-231 cells in a Ubc13-dependent manner. (A) NF-\u03baBactivation in UEV-overexpressing cells. Nuclear or whole-cell extracts were prepared, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE gel,followed by western blotting analysis using an anti-p65 antibody to measure NF-\u043aB nuclear enrichment and an anti-P(S32)-inhibitor of NF-\u03baB\u03b1(I\u03baB\u03b1) antibody to assess the degree of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation as an indication of its degradation and release of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus.

MDA-MB-231 cell extracts expressing UEV1A or UEV1A-F38E were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, followed bywestern blotting with an anti-Ubc13 monoclonal antibody and an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. (D) Uev1A-F38E failed to activate NF-\u03baB. Experimentalconditions were as described in Figure 4A.Wu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 9 of 15http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75decreased the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells as de-termined by a transwell assay, while MMP9 depletionhad much less effect (Figure 6B and Additional file 2:Figure S6A). Similarly, MMP1 depletion in UEV1A-overexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 2:Figure S6B) also decreased invasiveness (Additional file 2:Figure S6C and D). To ask whether overexpression ofMMP1 is indeed sufficient to dictate MDA-MB-231 cellinvasion, we constructed an MMP1-expression plasmidand transfected it to MDA-MB-231 cells, which re-sulted in a 2.6-fold increase in the MMP1 transcript level(Additional file 2: Figure S6E) and a similar increase at theprotein level (Additional file 2: Figure S6F), as well as a2.3-fold increase in invasion (Figure 6C and Additionalfile 2: Figure S6G). We then restored MMP1 level inUEV1-depleted cells to that of control cells (Figure 6Dand E), which was sufficient to rescue the invasiveness inboth UEV1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 6F).As MMP1 is an important cancer cell metastasis factor[44-46], the above findings allow us to conclude thatUEV1A regulates metastasis through tightly controllingMMP1 expression.UevA-Ubc13 control MMP1 expression by regulating NF-\u03baBTo ask whether Uev1A regulates MMP1 through NF-\u03baB,we cloned the 1.8-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence(Figure 7A) into pGL4.2 and co-transfected it with plas-mids expressing UEV1A, UEV1A-F38E or an empty vectorinto MDA-MB-231 cells. A luciferase assay showed thatUEV1A expression activates the MMP1 promoter and thatthis activation relies on its interaction with Ubc13, as theUev1A-F38E substitution completely abolished the activa-tion (Figure 7B). The predicted NF-\u03baB binding site (\u22121133to approximately \u22121125) in the MMP1 promoter was thenmutated (Figure 7A) and the mutated reporter was usedto co-transfect with plasmids expressing UEV1A, UEV1C,MMS2 or the empty vector into MDA-MB-231 cells. Over-expression of only UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2,Figure 5 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1A positively regulates MMP1 and MMP9 expression.

To gain direct evidence that the predictedNF-\u03baB binding site indeed interacts with NF-\u03baB, an EMSAwas performed using nuclear lysates from TNF\u03b1-treatedand untreated cells (Figure 7D). A biotin-labeled syntheticMMP1 promoter probe containing the putative NF-\u03baB-binding sequence was able to interact with the nuclearlysate and this interaction was enhanced when cells werepretreated with TNF-\u03b1, which induced nuclear transloca-tion of p65 (Figure 7E, lanes 4 and 5). This interactionwas abolished when the NF-\u03baB binding sequence wasFigure 6 Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 is a downstream effector for ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1A-inducedmetastasis.

We conclude from the above observa-tions that NF-\u03baB directly binds to the MMP1 promoter atthe predicted binding site.DiscussionIt has been reported previously that human cells containtwo UEV genes, UEV1 and MMS2, which share >90%amino acid sequence-identity in their core domains [4].Although both Uev1A and Mms2 proteins serve asFigure 7 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1A regulates Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression through an NF-\u03baBtarget sequence in the MMP1 promoter.

Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 12 of 15http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75cofactors for Ubc13-mediated K63-linked polyubiquiti-nation, their biological functions are apparently distinctand only the Uev1A-Ubc13 complex is involved in NF-\u03baBsignaling [10]. It has been puzzling us that Uev1A andMms2 have different molecular weights and migratedifferently; however, a monoclonal antibody capable ofrecognizing both purified Uev1A and Mms2 only detectsa single band in western blot analysis, and siRNA deple-tion of either Mms2 or Uev1 only partially reduced the in-tensity of this band. A careful examination in this studyreveals that in addition to the previously reported twoUEV1 splicing variants UEV1A and UEV1B [1], culturedWu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 13 of 15http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75human cells contain a novel UEV1 splicing variant, UEV1C,lacking the N-terminal 30 amino acid unique region ofUev1A. The resulting 147-residue protein would co-migrate with Mms2 during electrophoresis. It turns outthat the UEV1C transcript is much more abundant thanUEV1A, and a Uev1-specific monoclonal antibody can de-tect cellular Uev1C but not Uev1A, unless the latter is ex-perimentally overexpressed.The current study investigates roles of UEV1A, UEV1Cand MMS2 in tumorigenesis using a breast cancer model.With comparable levels of ectopic expression, it wasfound that only UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is ableto promote cell migration and invasion. Similarly, overex-pression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C promotes tumorgrowth and metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Theabove results are highly reliable, as the target gene expres-sion is under tight regulation of a Tet-on promoter, andthe phenotypes were only observed under Dox-inducedconditions. In a reverse experiment, depletion of Uev1 incultured breast cancer cells significantly reduces cell mi-gration and invasion, as well as tumor growth and metas-tasis in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that thecellular Uev1 (presumbly Uev1A) level plays a critical rolein breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.To understand the molecular mechanism by whichUev1A promotes tumorigenesis, we demonstrated thatoverexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, isable to promote I\u03baB\u03b1 phorsphorylation and NF-\u03baB trans-location into the nucleus, and that this effect absolutely re-lies on its physical interaction with Ubc13. It is conceivablethat as previously reported, the Ubc13-Uev1A heteromiderserves as an E2 to assemble K63-linked poly-Ub chainsalong with cognate really interesting new gene (RING)-finger E3s like TRAF2 and/or TRAF6 [17,34], whichrecruit K63 polyUb-binding proteins like NEMO [18]and TAB2/3 [47,48] to phorsphorylate and subsequentlydegrade I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to NF-\u03baB activation.NF-\u03baB activation promotes the transcription of manydownstream genes in the signaling cascade [41]. However,the moderate level of NF-\u03baB activation by UEV1A overex-pression does not appear to induce all NF-\u03baB targetinggenes. To understand how overexpression of UEV1A leadsto tumorigenesis and particularly metastasis in breast can-cer cells, we surveyed NF-\u03baB and metastasis-related genesand focused on two candidate genes, MMP1 and MMP9,both of which are highly induced upon UEV1A overex-pression. Experimental results as presented in this reportindicate that both genes are tightly regulatd by cellularUev1 levels; however, depletion of MMP9 was not as ef-fective as that of MMP1 on cell migration and invasion.As ecotopic expression of MMP1 to restore the wild-typelevel in Uev1-depleted cells also restored wild-type levelof invasiveness, it is plausible to conclude that MMP1is the critical downstream effector of UEV1A-inducedbreast cancer metastasis, although this study does not ruleout the contributions of MMP9 and possibly other genes.The signal transduction cascade of Uev1A\u2192NF-\u03baB\u2192MMP1\u2192metastasis is further confirmed by showing thatUev1A-induced MMP1 expression is dependent on bothUbc13 and the predicted NF-\u03baB binding site located inthe MMP1 promoter. Although this report only presentsdata from one human breast cancer line, we have obtainedcomparable results with a different breast cancer cell lineMCF7 (data not shown), indicating that the tumorigenicand metastatic effects of Uev1A is a general phenomenonin breast cancers.While the experimental evidence as shown in this reportclearly indicates that UEV1A can function as a proto-oncogene, the clinical relevance of this finding awaits fu-ture investigation. Nevertheless, our limited TissueScanmicroarray data indicate a low (less than 2-fold) variationin UEV1A transcript levels among five normal humanbreast samples, compared with an increase of up to 20-fold in some breast cancer samples. As NF-\u03baB activation iscommonly observed in breast cancers [24,25,49] andUEV1 upregulation is also frequently observed in breastcancer samples [12-14] and in cultured tumor cell lines[4], and is found to be correlated to tumorigenic indicators[2,3], it is conceivable that a certain percentage of breastcancer samples with NF-\u03baB activation is due to elevatedUEV1A expression.This study demonstrated that the N-terminal region ofUev1A is the molecular determinant of its cellular func-tion(s) in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Although theexact cellular function of Uev1C remains a mystery, ourprevious studies [10] have shown that truncated Uev1Amissing the N-terminal 30 amino acids behaves likeMms2 in terms of subcellular localization and promo-tion of K63-linked di-Ub versus poly-Ub chains in vitro,suggesting that Uev1C may play an Mms2-related role.Given the importance of Uev1 in signaling and tumori-genesis, small-molecule inhibitors against Uev1 have beenisolated [20,50] based on their interference with the Ubc13-Uev1A interaction, and one appears to be able to inhibitproliferation and survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphomacells. It is unclear whether these inhibitors also interferewith the Ubc13-Mms2 interaction, as critical residuesresponaible for the heterdimer formation are conserved be-tween Uev1 and Mms2 [9]. Furthermore, this study pro-vides evidence that a desired inhibitor should target theN-terminal region of Uev1A instead of the Ubc13-Uev1interface. Hence, this report provides an experimental andtheoretical cornerstone for future diagnosis and therapyby targeting Uev1A for the cure of breast cancer.ConclusionsAmong three Uev gene products, only Uev1A promotesbreast tumor metastasis, which is primarily throughWu et al.
