"Fur-Regulated Iron Uptake System of Edwardsiella ictaluri and ItsInfluence on Pathogenesis and Immunogenicity in the Catfish HostJavier Santander,a,b Greg Golden,a Soo-Young Wanda,a and Roy Curtiss IIIa,bThe Biodesign Institute, Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology,a and School of Life Sciences,b Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USAThe ability of bacterial pathogens to take up iron from the host during infection is necessary for their multiplication within thehost. However, host high-affinity iron binding proteins limit levels of free iron in fluids and tissues. To overcome this deficiencyof iron during infection, bacterial pathogens have developed iron uptake systems that are upregulated in the absence of iron,typically tightly controlled by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein. The iron uptake system of Edwardsiella ictaluri, a host-restricted pathogen of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and the main pathogen of this fish in aquaculture, is unknown. Herewe describe the E. ictaluri Fur protein, the iron uptake machinery controlled by Fur, and the effects of fur gene deletion on viru-lence and immunogenicity in the fish host. Analysis of the E. ictaluri Fur protein shows that it lacks the N-terminal region foundin the majority of pathogen-encoded Fur proteins. However, it is fully functional in regulated genes encoding iron uptake pro-teins. E. ictaluri grown under iron-limited conditions upregulates an outer membrane protein (HemR) that shows heme-hemo-globin transport activity and is tightly regulated by Fur. In vivo studies showed that an E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutant is attenuated andimmune protective in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), triggering systemic immunity. We conclude thatan E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutant could be an effective component of an immersion-oral vaccine for the catfish industry.Vertebrates sequester iron from invading pathogens as a meansof nutritional immunity, using high-affinity iron bindingproteins to limit levels of free iron in biological fluids and tissues inorder to deprive pathogens of this key nutritional component.Invading bacterial pathogens sense this iron depletion as a signalthat they are within a host and induce the expression of genes thatallow iron uptake in order to overcome the host defenses. Toobtain this host sequestered iron, most pathogenic bacteria havedeveloped iron uptake systems that usually are siderophore medi-ated or that directly take up iron from host proteins (50). Sidero-phore-mediated systems typically involve low-molecular-weightsiderophores released by the bacteria that chelate iron and subse-quently transfer it to iron-regulated outer membrane proteins(IROMPs) that function as receptors of the iron-siderophorecomplexes (39, 50). These siderophore mechanisms of iron acqui-sition have been linked to the virulence of different fish bacterialpathogens, such as Vibrio anguillarum (Listonella anguillarum)(38, 73), Aeromonas salmonicida (24, 27), Photobacterium damse-lae subsp. piscicida (13), Edwardsiella tarda (25), and Tenacibacu-lum maritimum (2). Direct iron uptake systems from host pro-teins rely on the interaction between specific microbial receptorsand host transferrin or heme-containing compounds (31, 41) andoften involve bacterial hemolytic or proteolytic activity (10). Usu-ally, both siderophore-mediated and direct iron uptake systemsare controlled by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein (10).Fur is a dimeric metal ion-dependent transcription regulatorthat controls the expression of genes involved in a diversity ofcellular functions, including iron uptake. Fur monomers typicallycontain two structural domains, the N-terminal DNA bindingdomain and the C-terminal dimerization domain (26, 28, 29).When Fur monomers are bound to Fe2\ufffd, they form a dimer thatbinds to promoter DNA regions (Fur boxes), repressing gene ex-pression (29). During oral-gastric infection, it is thought that thesmall intestine conditions are anaerobic and therefore replete withfree Fe2\ufffd, leading to an active Fur protein that represses genesinvolved in iron uptake. The iron uptake system is induced uponinvasion, when iron is presumably sequestered by host iron bind-ing proteins (26, 28).Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is the most importantaquaculture species in the United States, accounting for more than60% of all U.S. aquaculture production (20), and Edwardsiellaictaluri is one of the most important pathogens in this industry(61). The most highly upregulated group of catfish genes follow-ing E. ictaluri infection are the genes involved in iron homeostasis,including those for intelectin, haptoglobin, hemopexin (Wap65),ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and ferritin (34, 35, 45, 46, 63). Thisindicates that there is a \u201ctug of war\u201d for the iron between thecatfish host and the bacterial pathogen E. ictaluri. While the ironacquisition system of E. ictaluri has not been previously character-ized, we observed that E. ictaluri grown in the absence of ironupregulates synthesis of a specific outer membrane protein. Thisobservation prompted us to investigate the iron uptake system ofE. ictaluri.In this study, we characterized the E. ictaluri Fur protein, theiron uptake system controlled by Fur, and the effects of the furgene on virulence and immunogenicity in the fish host. We deter-mined that fish isolates of Edwardsiella have a fur gene that issmaller than other fur family members, where its evolutionarypathway may have undergone genome degradation. We also es-tablished that E. ictaluri does not secrete detectable siderophoresReceived 4 January 2012 Returned for modification 27 February 2012Accepted 13 May 2012Published ahead of print 21 May 2012Editor: A.

Salmonella \ufffdfur mutantsare attenuated in mammals when administered orally (51) or in-traperitoneally (16) but are not very immunogenic (11). We alsoevaluated the potential utilization of E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutants as alive attenuated vaccine. E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutants were attenuated inzebrafish and catfish hosts. When E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutants wereadministered by immersion or orally, they conferred immuneprotection, triggering systemic and skin immune responses.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains, plasmids, media, and reagents. The bacterial strainsand plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Bacteriological media and com-ponents were from Difco (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Antibiotics and reagentswere from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Taq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used inall PCR tests. Qiagen products (Hilden, Germany) were used to isolateplasmid DNA, gel purify fragments, or purify PCR products. T4 ligase, T4DNA polymerase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) were from Pro-mega.Sequence analysis. A nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool(BLAST) search was performed based on the sequences of the putative furand heme uptake genes present in the genome sequence of E. ictaluri93-146 accessed from NCBI\u2019s Entrez Genome database (NC_012779). fursequences were obtained from NCBI\u2019s Entrez Protein database for Ed-wardsiella ictaluri 93-146 (YP_002934295.1), E. tarda PPD 130/90(AEO72442.1), E. tarda EIB202 (YP_003296656.1), E. tarda FL6-60(ADM42454.1), E. tarda ATCC 23685 (ZP_06715756.1), Escherichia coliO157:H7 EDL933 (NP_286398.1), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty2(NP_455254.1), Yersinia pestis KIM 10 (NP_668533.1), Vibrio cholerae(AAA27519.1), A. salmonicida A449 (YP_001143048.1), Pseudomonasputida (YP_001269900.1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NP_253452.1).Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the CLC FreeWorkbench software tool (v. 6.1; CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). Pro-tein structure-based alignments were performed by using the web-basedinterface for ESPript v.2.2 located at http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi (18). The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the E. ictaluriFur, HemP, HemR, HemT, HemU, HemV, and HemS proteins were pre-dicted using position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) alignmentand HHpred (62).Construction of E. ictaluri mutants. The recombinant pEZ suicidevectors (Table 1) carrying the linked flanking regions to generate an in-frame deletion of the fur or hmuR gene were constructed as describedpreviously (55\u201357).

The downstream gene-flanking regions were amplified by prim-ers 3 and 4. The flanking regions were ligated and cloned into pMEG-375digested with SphI and XbaI. To construct E. ictaluri mutants, the suicideplasmid was conjugationally transferred from Escherichia coli \ufffd7213 (52)to E. ictaluri strains. Strains containing single-crossover plasmid inser-tions were isolated on BHI agar plates containing Col and Amp. Loss ofthe suicide vector after the second recombination between homologousregions (i.e., allelic exchange) was selected by using the sacB-based sucrosesensitivity counterselection system (14) adapted to E. ictaluri (55, 57). Thecolonies were selected for Amps and Colr and screening by PCR usingprimers 1 and 4. Biochemical profiles of E. ictaluri strains were deter-mined using the API 20E system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L\u2019Etoile, France).Construction of Salmonella Typhimurium \ufffdfur-44. The fur gene of\ufffd3761 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UK-1 (Table 1) was de-leted in frame mediated the previous suicide vector methodology (55, 57).The primers used to construct the suicide vectors are listed in Table 2. Theflanking regions were ligated and cloned into pRE112 (14) digested withBglII and XmaI. The S. Typhimurium \ufffdfur-44 mutation consisted of adeletion of 706 bp, including 453 bp of the fur gene and 253 bp of the furpromoter region, with the Crp binding and the OxyR binding sites.Complementation of the fur and hemR genes. The fur gene of E.ictaluri, with its own promoter, was cloned into the pAYCY184 vector (7)at the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites and into pEZ151 at the AdhIrestriction site. The primers used to amplify fur were 5=-TCGTCTAGATGTCTGCCGCCTGCCGGCGC-3= (upstream) and 5=-CCCAAGCTTTCAGGCCTTTTCATCGTGCA-3= (downstream). XbaI and HindIII sites,respectively, were included in these primers (underlined). The resultingplasmid, pEZ136, was used to complement Salmonella \ufffdfur-44 mutantstrains, and pEZ191 was used to complement E. ictaluri. The primers usedto amplify hemR were 5=-TCGTCTAGATTTACACTTTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATGTTATGCCTACGCTTTTCTCCCCTTCCCTACGC-3= (up-stream) and 5=-CCCAAGCTTCCGCTCGAGCTACCACTGGTAGCTGAGCAGCAGACGGGC-3= (downstream). XbaI and HindIII sites,respectively, were included in these primers (underlined). The lactosepromoter (Plac) was used to express the hemR gene. The resulting plasmid,pEZ192, was used to complement E. ictaluri.SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To evaluate the synthesis of Fur,the strains were grown in 3 ml of BHI broth or LB broth at 28\u00b0C withaeration (180 rpm). The samples were collected when the culture reachedan absorbance of 0.85 (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 1.0 \ufffd 1.0 \t108 CFU/ml). One milliliter of culture was collected and prepared forWestern blot analysis (54). The total proteins were normalized using aNanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000) at 25 \ufffdg/\ufffdl, separated by 10%(wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophore-sis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (54). A fat-free milkpowder solution (5%, wt/vol) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supple-mented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) was used for blocking. The mem-brane was incubated individually with a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-GroEL antibody (Sigma) (1:10,000) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Furantibody (1:10,000) (60) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three timeswith PBS-T, and then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phos-phatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma). Colorwas developed with a mixture of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate mixture (NBT-BCIP) (Amaresco), chromo-genic substrates for alkaline phosphatase.OMP isolation. Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane proteins (OMPs)were obtained as previously described (55). OMPs were isolated from E.ictaluri grown under iron-replete conditions (BHI broth and BHI brothsupplemented with 150 \ufffdm FeSO4). Iron-regulated outer membrane pro-teins (IROMPs) were isolated from E. ictaluri grown in BHI broth supple-mented with 2=2=-dipyridyl (150 \ufffdM) (iron-depleted conditions). Theouter membrane proteins were normalized to 25 \ufffdg/\ufffdl by using theNanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000) and separated by 10% (wt/vol)sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Coo-massie blue staining was performed to visualize proteins.Protein identification. The single protein band of 72 kDa synthe-sized in the absence of iron or in E. ictaluri \ufffdfur mutants was excised fromthe SDS-polyacrylamide gel for peptide sequencing analysis (ProtTechInc., Norristown, PA) by using NanoLC-MS/MS peptide sequencingtechnology. The protein gel band was destained, cleaned, and digestedin-gel with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI).The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed with a liquid chromatogra-phy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system, in which a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with a 75-\ufffdm-inner-diame-ter reverse-phase C18 column was coupled to an ion trap massspectrometer (Thermo, Palo Alto, CA). The mass spectrometric data wereutilized to search the nonredundant protein database at the National Cen-ter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).Detection of secreted siderophores. Production of compounds withsiderophore activity was tested by the chemical assays described bySchwyn and Neilands (58) in solid and liquid media. The assays wereperformed by spotting 10 \ufffdl of each bacterial culture grown under iron-limiting conditions onto a modified chromoazurol S (CAS) (Sigma) agar.The siderophore levels produced by the strains on plates were visualizedby a yellow-orange halo around the bacterial colony after 18 to 72 h ofincubation. For siderophore detection in liquid, supernatants from bac-terial cultures grown in BHI broth or LB broth supplemented with 2=2=-dipyridyl (150 \ufffdM) were mixed with CAS solution, and the absorbance ofthe mixture was measured at 630 nm.Iron-free siderophores were obtained by the following method. Bac-terial cultures grown in 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with 2=2=-dipyri-dyl (150 \ufffdM) or FeSO4 (150 \ufffdM) for 18 to 24 h at 28\u00b0C (OD600 of 1.0)were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 \t g for 10 min. The superna-tants were filtered through a 0.2-\ufffdm-pore-size membrane filter to com-pletely remove the cells, acidified with 25 \ufffdl of 10 N HCl, and extractedtwice with a total of 4 ml of ethyl acetate for catechols and benzyl alcoholfor hydroxamates (44). The aqueous phase was dried with gaseous N2 andresuspended in 40 \ufffdl of methanol, and 10 \ufffdl was spotted onto 250-\ufffdm-layer (20 by 20 cm) flexible PE SIL G/UV254 plates (Whatman).

Plates were then removed from thechamber, allowed to dry, and then immersed briefly in 0.1% FeCl3 tovisualize Fe binding compounds. Avian-pathogenic Escherichia coli\ufffd7122, S. Typhimurium UK-1 \ufffd3761 (36, 52), and S. Typhimurium\ufffd11143 \ufffdfur-44 were used as controls (Table 1).Utilization of heme and hemoglobin by E. ictaluri. Sterile filter paperdisks were placed onto a BHI agar plate supplemented with 2=2=-dipyridyl(150 \ufffdM) and swab inoculated with an E. ictaluri strain. The disks wereinoculated with 5 \ufffdl of water (control), heme (10 \ufffdM; Sigma), and he-moglobin (\ufffd9.3 \ufffdM; Sigma). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 28\u00b0C.Growth around the paper disk indicated positive utilization of the ironsource.Semiquantitative RT-PCR. Expression of putative Fur-regulatedgenes was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNAextraction was performed with an RNeasy QIAgene kit from wild-type E.ictaluri grown in the presence and absence of iron and from E. ictaluri J135\ufffdfur-35 grown in BHI. The cells were grown until late exponential phase(OD600 of 0.85; \ufffd1 \t 108 CFU/ml). cDNA synthesis was performed withthe SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) using ran-dom hexamer primers. Semiquantitative PCR was performed using thespecific primers listed in Table 2. The number of PCR cycles was normal-ized to 27. The 16S rRNA (rrn) gene was used as an expression control,and fadR was used as a single-gene expression control.Bacterial inoculate preparation. Bacterial strains were grown over-night in standing cultures that were diluted 1:20 in prewarmed BHI brothwith mild aeration (180 rpm) at 28\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.85 (\ufffd108 CFU/ml).Bacteria were sedimented for 10 min by centrifugation (5,865 \t g) atroom temperature and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered salinecontaining 0.01% gelatin (BSG) (12) to densities appropriate for the in-oculation.Infection and immunization of zebrafish (D. rerio). The zebrafishchallenges were performed by the methodology described earlier (47),with modifications (55, 57). The water temperature was 26 \ufffd 1\u00b0C, and thefish were acclimated for 2 weeks prior to the experiment. Groups of 12adult zebrafish (average weight, 0.5 g) were sedated in 100 mg/liter tric-aine methanesulfonate (MS-222; Sigma) and injected intramuscularly(i.m.) with 10 \ufffdl of the bacterial suspension per fish. A 3/10-ml U-100ultrafine insulin syringe with a 0.5-in.-long (ca. 1-cm-long) 29-gauge nee-dle (catalog no. BD-309301; VWR) was used to inject the fish. Two sets ofcontrols were used: fish that were not injected and fish that were injectedwith 10 \ufffdl of BSG (12). Moribund fish demonstrating clinical signs wereeuthanized, necropsied, and plated for enumeration of bacterial loads invarious organs (47). Survivors of each dose at 4 weeks after i.m. inocula-tion were challenged with 105 CFU of E. ictaluri (100 50% lethal doses[LD50]). The fish were fed twice daily with TetraMin tropical fish flakefeed. During the experiments, the fish were observed daily, and everyother day the water quality was monitored for pH, NO2, and NO3 withstandard kits (Lifegard Aquatics water testing strips). The LD50 for theinfection trials was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1).Fish care and use were in accordance with the requirements of the ArizonaState University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.i.c. infection and immunization of catfish (I. punctatus). Specific-pathogen-free channel catfish fingerlings with a mean weight of 18.5 \ufffd 1.3g were used. The animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups of10 to 25 fish each in 100-liter tanks. Each tank was equipped with a recir-culating, biofiltered, mechanically filtered, and UV-treated water systemwith 12-h light cycle per day. The water temperature was set at 28 \ufffd 1\u00b0Cduring the first 2 weeks of acclimatization and during the course of theexperiments. The fish were fed daily with commercial Aquamax grower400 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO). During the experiments, the fishwere observed daily, and every other day the water quality was monitoredfor pH, NO2, and NO3 with standard kits (Lifegard Aquatics water testingstrips). Catfish were infected by the intracelomic (i.c.) route with 105 to108 CFU of E. ictaluri strains (fish were not fed until 1 h after infection).The fish were anesthetized with buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (pH7.5) (MS-222; Sigma) (100 mg/liter of water) prior to handling. The LD50was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1). Moribund animalswere euthanized and then necropsied to evaluate the presence of E. ictaluriin kidney, spleen, and liver.Immersion immunization of catfish. Catfish fingerlings were im-mersed in a solution of E. ictaluri \ufffdfur-35 containing 107 CFU/ml for 30min. At 6 weeks postimmunization, fish were challenged by immersionwith 107 CFU/ml of wild-type E. ictaluri (10 LD50) for 30 min. The ani-mals were fasted for 24 h prior to oral inoculation and for 1 h postinocu-lation. Nonimmunized animals were used as a control. During the exper-iments, the fish were observed daily.Oral immunization of catfish. Catfish were fasted for 24 h before oralinoculation with the E. ictaluri strains. Fish were anesthetized with buff-ered tricaine methanesulfonate (pH 7.5) (100 mg/liter of water) prior tohandling. The animals were orally inoculated with 100 \ufffdl of the corre-sponding bacterial suspension (see below). BSG (12) was used as a con-trol. The fish were not fed until 1 h after inoculation.Determination of IgM titers in serum and skin mucus. Cutaneousmucus and blood samples were collected at both 2 weeks prior to immu-nization and 4 weeks postimmunization as described previously (55). Teni.c. immunized fish and 10 immersion-immunized fish were sampled in-dividually. The experiment was repeated twice. E. ictaluri outer mem-brane proteins diluted in 20 mM Tris-OH (pH 8.0) and purified E. ictalurilipopolysaccharide (LPS) were independently applied to polyvinyl chlo-ride 96-well plates, both at 100 ng per well. The plates were incubatedovernight at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 200 \ufffdl of PBS\u2013 0.05% Tween (PBS-T)per well, and blocked with 1% sea buffer (Thermo, Rockford, IL) dilutedin PBS (1 h at room temperature). Catfish serum samples diluted in PBS(1:2) and undiluted mucus samples were plated in triplicate wells at 100\ufffdl/well. Triplicate control wells on each plate contained diluted sera fromimmunized and nonimmunized catfish. Mucus assays also included wellsof pooled mucus from nonexposed fish. The plates were incubated over-night at 4\u00b0C and washed five times with PBS-T. The biotinylated rabbitanti-catfish Ig antibody was applied at 0.25 to 0.50 \ufffdg/well. The plateswere incubated for 1 h at room temperature and were washed five timeswith PBS-T. Application of the primary antibody was followed by appli-cation of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Southern Biotech,Birmingham, AL) diluted in PBS (1:50,000). The enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate diethanolamine (100 \ufffdl; Sigma) was added andincubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with50 \ufffdl of 3 M NaOH. The absorbance (A405) values were determined on akinetic microplate reader (model V-max; Molecular Devices Corp.,Sunnyvale, CA) at 30 min and 1 h. The immunized fish were challenged at6 weeks postimmunization as described previously.Statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SPSS software), followedby least-significant-difference (LSD) analysis, was used to evaluate differ-ences in antibody titers, using 95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method (SPSS software) was applied to obtain the survival fractionsfollowing challenges. P values of 0.05 were considered statistically sig-nificant.RESULTSSequence analysis of fur. An analysis of DNA and protein se-quences, structural alignment, predicted 3D structure, and pre-dicted binding residues revealed that the E. ictaluri and E. tardaFur proteins have several key differences from other bacterial ironregulator protein families (Fig. 1 to 3). This provides evidence thatthese Fur proteins are members of a distinctive bacterial iron reg-ulator protein family, shaped by gene reduction. The E. ictaluri furgene sequence from E. ictaluri wild-type J100 is identical to thesequence from the E. ictaluri 93-146 strain published at the NCBI.In comparison to E. coli and Salmonella fur genes, the E. ictaluri furgene has a smaller open reading frame (ORF), and has a guanineSantander et al.2692 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgplus cytosine (G\ufffdC) content of 57%, which is 10% higher thanthose of the Escherichia coli (48.5%) and Salmonella (47.7%) furgenes (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The fur genesequences from the fish-isolated E. tarda PPD130/91 and E. tardaEIB202 (71) contain 333 identical base pairs, in contrast with thehuman-isolated E. tarda ATCC 23685, which contains a longer furgene (435 bp) similar to those of the rest of the enteric bacteria (seeFig. S1 in the supplemental material). The E. ictaluri fur promoterregion contains a Crp binding site, indicating that Crp might par-ticipate in Fur regulation (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental mate-rial).The Fur protein from fish-isolated E. tarda PPD130/91 and E.tarda EIB202 (71) contains 111 identical residues, in contrast withthe longer Fur proteins in E. coli (145 residues), Salmonella Typhi-murium (150 residues), Yersinia pestis (148 residues), and otherenteric bacteria (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the human-isolated strainE. tarda ATCC 23685 contains a longer Fur protein (145 residues)similar to those of the rest of the enteric bacteria, indicating that itmay be more adapted to humans than to fish. E. ictaluri 93-146and E. ictaluri J100 contain a shorter Fur with 104 identical resi-dues (Fig. 1). Alignment of these sequences showed that the N-ter-minal helices, \ufffd1, \ufffd2, and \ufffd3, at the DNA binding domain aremissing in E. ictaluri, as well as in the E. tarda fish-isolated Furproteins (Fig. 1). The \ufffd4 helix at the Fur DNA binding domain isstill intact in E. ictaluri and E. tarda fish isolates, sharing about90% identity with other bacterial Fur proteins (Fig. 1). Structuralprotein alignment between functional representative bacterial Furproteins revealed that 37 amino acid residues out of 104 residues(\ufffd36%) are strictly conserved in E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 1). E. ictaluriFur has 29%, 53%, 54%, 57%, and 93% amino acid similarity tothe Fur proteins of Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, S. enterica, Y.pestis, and E. tarda, respectively.In terms of phylogeny, the fish-isolated Edwardsiella Fur pro-teins belong to a distinctive group compared to those from the restof the Enterobacteriaceae family (Fig. 2). Although the Enterobac-teriaceae share a Fur ancestor, the only phylogenic group with ashort Fur protein among enteric bacteria is Edwardsiella (Fig. 2),indicating that Fur might have undergone host bacterial pathogenspecialization.Structural protein analysis showed that Edwardsiella Fur con-tains two domains, like other Fur proteins (32, 48). The DNAbinding domain harbors the Zn2\ufffd bond residues, and thedimerization domain harbors the Fe2\ufffd bond residues (Fig. 1 and3A and B). We observed that E. ictaluri Fur, as well as the E. tardaFur (only fish-isolated strains), do not contain the \ufffd-helices \ufffd1,\ufffd2, and \ufffd3 (Fig. 1). Analysis of the residues related to the Zn2\ufffdand Fe2\ufffd bonds showed they are located in positions similar tothose for their corresponding residues in the Pseudomonas Furprotein but misplaced with respect to their corresponding resi-dues in E. coli Fur. Specifically, the E. coli Fur-related residuesCys92 and Cys95 required for the Zn2\ufffd bond (17, 32) (in E. icta-luri Fur, Cys48 and Cys51 [Fig. 3A and C]) and the residuesCys132 and Cys88 required for the Fe2\ufffd bond (17, 32) (in E. icta-luri Fur, Cys93 and Cys88 [Fig. 3A and C]) are located at the loopregion in E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 3A and C). The Pseudomonas Fur-related residues His24, His86, Asp88, and Glu107 required for theZn2\ufffd bond (48) (in E. ictaluri Fur, Glu36, His45, and Glu56 [Fig.3B and D]) and the residues His32, Glu80, His89, and Glu100FIG 1 E. ictaluri Fur alignment and secondary structure. The white stars indicate the residues related to the Zn2\ufffd binding pocket. The black stars indicate theresidues related to the Fe2\ufffd binding pocket. The black circles indicate the cysteine residues related to E. coli Fe2\ufffd and Zn2\ufffd binding pockets. The secondarystructure at the top of the alignment corresponds to the E. ictaluri Fur protein. The secondary structure at the bottom of the alignment corresponds to theEscherichia coli Fur protein. Spirals represent \ufffd-helices, and arrows represent \r-sheets.Iron Uptake by E. ictaluriAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2693http://iai.asm.orgrequired for the Fe2\ufffd bond (48) (in E. ictaluri Fur, His42, Glu63,His80, and Glu90 [Fig. 3D and E]) are located in their respectivedomains within E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 3B, D, and E). In P. aeruginosa,the Fur residue His32 is required for the Fe2\ufffd bond and is essentialfor its activity (4). However, the N-terminal region, where His32would normally be located, is absent in the E. ictaluri Fur protein(Fig. 1). Spectroscopic and biochemical data have shown that thestructural zinc sites in the P. aeruginosa and E. coli Fur proteins aredifferent, which might be related to their specific functions in thedifferent organisms. However, in both the E. coli and P. aeruginosaFur proteins, the N-terminal region is essential for Fur activity (4,9). On the other hand, the importance of the cysteines is differentin E. coli Fur and in P. aeruginosa Fur, because the Cys92 andCys95 bound to Zn2\ufffd in E. coli Fur are essential for its activity (8).The single cysteine residue in the P. aeruginosa Fur is dispensablefor its in vivo activity (33), and it is absent in other PseudomonasFur proteins, such as P. putida Fur (Fig. 1). Based on the aboveanalysis, we believe that E. ictaluri Fur is a distinct Fur proteinamong the Fur family. Further structural information on the E.ictaluri Fur protein is necessary for a better understanding of thespecific structure-function relationship within the Fur family.Complementation of the fur gene. The structural analysis of E.ictaluri Fur indicated that the overall domain organization is dif-ferent from that of other Fur family members, but it has the sameset of key residue groups and likely a similar mechanism as otherFur proteins (Fig. 1 to 3). To further evaluate the functionality ofE. ictaluri Fur, we complemented \ufffdfur mutants of Salmonella en-terica with the E. ictaluri Pfur-fur gene cloned into the low-copy-number plasmid pEZ136 (Table 1). S. enterica serovar Typhimu-rium \ufffdfur-44 was utilized for complementation assays (Table 1).S. enterica \ufffdfur mutants present a constitutive synthesis ofIROMPs and secretion of siderophores (Fig. 4A to C). E. ictaluriPfur-fur complements S. enterica \ufffdfur-44 mutants, repressingIROMP and siderophore synthesis in an iron-dependent fashion(Fig. 4). This indicates that the missing N-terminal region, (con-taining the \ufffd1, \ufffd2, and \ufffd3 helices) is not essential for the Furfunction (59).Siderophore synthesis in E. ictaluri. Results from CAS liquidand plate assays showed that E. ictaluri does not synthesize detect-able siderophores (Fig. 5A). Although the E. ictaluri chromosomecontains a ferric enterobactin transport protein (FepE, sidero-phore receptor; NC_012779.1) and a TonB-dependent fer-FIG 2 Molecular phylogenetic analysis of fur. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model(65). The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 100 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (15). Branches correspondingto partitions reproduced in fewer than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. Whenthe number of common sites was less than 100 or less than one-fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum-parsimony method was used; otherwise, theBIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The analysis involved 48 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were first, second, third, andnoncoding. There were a total of 546 positions in the final data set. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 (64). The gold lines indicate a representativearchaea fur evolutionary path, the green lines indicate the Enterobacteriaceae fur family evolution path, and the red lines indicate the fish-isolated Edwardsiella furevolution path.Santander et al.2694 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgrichrome receptor protein (FcuA; NC_012779.1), thin-layer chro-matography (TLC) analysis showed that E. ictaluri does notsecrete either catechol- or hydroxylamine-related siderophores orheme binding molecules (data not shown), regardless of the pres-ence of iron in the growth medium or Fur protein (Fig. 5B). Ourresults correlate with previous observations (67) and with the factthat siderophore biosynthesis genes are not present in the E. icta-luri chromosome (72).Fur iron-regulated outer membrane proteins and heme up-take machinery. Wild-type E. ictaluri grown under iron limitingconditions and E. ictaluri \ufffdfur-35 mutants both upregulate anIROMP of \ufffd72 kDa, indicating that this protein is iron-Fur de-pendent and related to iron acquisition (Fig. 5C to E). Proteinidentification indicated that this IROMP corresponds to a TonB-dependent heme receptor protein (HemR) (Fig. 6). The gene en-coding HemR is part of the hemPRSTUV operon, which containsthe genes required for the synthesis of the heme uptake machinery(Fig. 6).Structural analysis of the iron uptake proteins reveled thatthese are similar to the putative E. tarda heme uptake system andto the Yersinia heme uptake system (Fig. 6). The outer membranereceptor HemR contains a \r-barrel structure with a cork requiredto transfer the heme into the cell (Fig. 7). Structural analysis ofHemR predicts a signal sequence peptide in the N-terminal region(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), which was observed in8% SDS-PAGE gel analysis (data not shown). The predictedmodel of heme transport is described in Fig. 7 and consists of thefollowing steps. First, heme is transferred into the cell, mediatedby HemR, where it is captured by HemT, a periplasmic heminbinding protein. It is then transported through the cytoplasmicmembrane by the ATP-dependent HemU-HemV cytoplasmicmembrane ABC transport complex. Once heme is transferred tothe cytoplasm, it is captured by HemS, a predicted heme degrada-tion-storage protein (Fig. 7).E. ictaluri uses heme and hemoglobin as iron sources, medi-ated by HemR. To determine whether E. ictaluri has a functionalheme-hemoglobin uptake system, we constructed an E. ictaluri\ufffdhemR mutant (thereby disrupting heme-hemoglobin receptorsynthesis) (Fig. 8A to C). E. ictaluri iron-depleted cells growpoorly in iron-depleted medium. Wild-type E. ictaluri iron-de-FIG 3 E. ictaluri Fur protein functional analysis.

Residues E36, H45, and E56, related to the Zn2\ufffd binding pocket, and residues H42, E63, and H80, related to the Fe2\ufffdbinding pocket, are related to the Pseudomonas Fur protein. Residues C51 and C48, related to the Zn2\ufffd binding pocket, and residues C88 and C93, related to theFe2\ufffd binding pocket, are related to the Escherichia coli Fur protein and are misplaced in the overall E. ictaluri Fur protein structure.Iron Uptake by E. ictaluriAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2695http://iai.asm.orgpleted cells were able to grow in iron-depleted medium when itwas supplemented with heme or hemoglobin as an iron source(Fig. 8D and G).

We identified a Fur box with an F-F-X-Rorientation at the hem operon, between the \ufffd4 and \ufffd14 positionsin the hemP gene (Fig. 9A). The Fur binding box in the F-F-X-Rconformation found in E. ictaluri is similar to the Pseudomonasaeruginosa Fur binding box (40) (Fig. 9A).Using the consensus hexamers for the E. ictaluri Fur box, weidentified six different promoters not related to the hemPRSTUVoperon, which could be regulated by the E. ictaluri Fur protein(Fig. 9B). These are promoters for Mg2\ufffd transport (mgtB), man-ganese transport (mntH), fatty acid degradation (fadR), heme syn-thesis (hemF), and glycolysis (gmpA). The expression of the hemR,mgtB, mntH, hemF, and gmpA genes in the absence of iron inwild-type E. ictaluri, as well as in our \ufffdfur mutant, was confirmedby RT-PCR (Fig. 9C). Although we predicted a Fur binding box atthe fadR promoter, its expression does not depend on either ironor the Fur protein (Fig. 9C).Virulence of E. ictaluri \ufffdfur-35 mutants in the fish host.

We found that E. ictaluri \ufffdfur administeredi.c. to catfish was attenuated, with around a 1,000-fold LD50 in-crease over that of the wild type (Fig. 10C and D).

We foundthat immersion-administered E. ictaluri \ufffdhemR (107 CFU/mlduring 30 min) was totally attenuated. E. ictaluri \ufffdhemR that wasorally administered to the catfish (108, 107, and 106 CFU/dose)was attenuated, with 80% survival at 108 CFU/dose and 100%survival at the lower doses. No hemorrhagic symptoms were ob-served in catfish that were immersion or orally infected with the\ufffdhemR mutant. E. ictaluri \ufffdhemR administered i.c. to the catfishwas attenuated but still caused significant mortality (Fig. 11) andhemorrhagic symptoms in the fish. In vitro growth of the E. ictaluriwild-type, \ufffdhemR, and \ufffdhemR(pEZ192) (complemented intrans) strains was similar in presence and absence of iron, exclud-ing the possibility that the attenuation is due to slow growth of the\ufffdhemR mutant (Fig. 8D to F).

We determined that E. ictaluri \ufffdfur does notconfer immune protection against i.c. challenge (Fig. 12A) butdoes confer full protection against immersion challenge (data notshown). Catfish that were immersion immunized or orally immu-nized with E. ictaluri \ufffdfur survived the immersion challenge (Fig.12B). Catfish i.c. immunized presented significant levels of IgMtiters, either in the blood or in the mucus (Fig. 12C). However,these IgM levels were not protective for i.c. challenged fish (Fig.12A). Immersion-immunized catfish presented significant levelsof systemic IgM and low levels of skin IgM titers (Fig. 12D). Theselevels were sufficient to protect the fish against the immersionchallenge (Fig. 12B).DISCUSSIONThe ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global regulatory protein thatis involved in diverse aspects of bacterial life. It is a metalloregu-latory protein that requires Fe2\ufffd, or other divalent transitionmetal ions such as Zn2\ufffd, as a cofactor (3, 40, 74). Fur possessesthree functional domains, the helix-turn-helix DNA binding do-main, the protein-protein dimerization domain, and the metalion-responsive domain. The last domain is essential for Furdimerization to form a functional protein (9, 48, 53). It has alreadybeen suggested by Pohl et al. (48) that the N-terminal helix isrequired for efficient DNA binding at the Fur box. This is sup-ported by mutagenesis studies. For example, P. aeruginosa Furhaving Ala10 mutated to glycine (a much poorer helix former)was unable to bind to the Fur box at the pvdS gene promoter (4).In E. coli it was shown that proteolytic cleavage of the 8 or 9 N-ter-minal residues resulted in a protein with reduced DNA bindingaffinity and specificity (9). However, as we have shown, the N-ter-minal region present in most of the Fur proteins is missing in E.ictaluri Fur (Fig. 1). The His32 residue, which interacts with Fe2\ufffdin P. aeruginosa Fur, is also missing (Fig. 1). This indicates that thebinding residues for Fe2\ufffd and other divalent ions in E. ictaluri Furare different than those used in E. coli and Pseudomonas Fur pro-teins.In terms of phylogeny, the sequenced E. tarda isolated fromhumans contains a fur gene longer than fur genes in E. tarda iso-lated from fish, which contain a short version and appear to havea common ancestor with the E. ictaluri fur gene (Fig. 2). Numer-ous examples of genome reduction in the transition from free-living bacteria to a parasitic life style have been documented (37).Pathogenic bacteria seem to have embarked on some of the sameprocesses of gene degradation and deletion that have led to exten-sive genome shrinkage in host-restricted pathogenic groups. Forexample, large numbers of pseudogenes have been identified inboth Y. pestis (43) and S. enterica serovar Typhi (42). Perhaps theemergence of a shorter fur gene in the Edwardsiella genus is anadaptation to the fish host. E. ictaluri was first described by Hawkein 1979 (22) and then characterized in 1981 (23), during the in-dustrial expansion of the catfish aquaculture industry (70). Thus,an alternate hypothesis is that the reduction of the fur gene couldbe part of a process of E. ictaluri host specialization due to inten-sive fish aquaculture. This observation raises the question of howthis shorter fur gene increases the fitness of Edwardsiella in the fishhost and how it appears during the evolution to host adaptation.Although E. ictaluri Fur is missing the N-terminal region ofother Fur proteins, it is fully functional in S. enterica, comple-menting the regulation of siderophore and IROMP synthesis in aniron-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). This indicates that a single \ufffd-he-lix in the DNA binding domain is enough for DNA binding andgene repression. Detailed studies are required to evaluate this hy-pothesis. Nevertheless, the fact that E. ictaluri fur complements S.enterica indicates a recent divergence from the Fur phylogenetictrunk and supports the idea that E. ictaluri fur might be part of anongoing process of host specialization.As mentioned above, iron acquisition mechanisms, such assiderophores, are essential for bacterial pathogens to overcomeFIG 12 Immune protection of E. ictaluri \ufffdfur-35 in catfish host.

However, we did not detect siderophore synthesisin E. ictaluri, regardless of the presence or absence of iron in thegrowth medium, the volume of culture, or the presence or absenceof the fur gene (Fig. 5). Our results correlate with previous obser-vations (67) and with the absence of know siderophore biosynthe-sis genes in the E. ictaluri chromosome (72). This observationreinforces the hypothesis of genome degradation during the pro-cess of host specialization of E. ictaluri to catfish, where sidero-phore genes might be lost. The siderophore receptor genes fepAand fcuA were identified in the chromosome of E. ictaluri withintheir respective operons, containing an undefined fur binding box(data not shown). This indicates that E. ictaluri could utilize sid-erophores secreted from other bacterial species, likely in a Fur-independent fashion. Further studies are required to evaluate theforeign utilization of siderophores by E. ictaluri. Nevertheless, inthe absence of iron, E. ictaluri upregulates a heme-hemoglobinacquisition system in a Fur-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 to 8). Dur-ing pathogenesis, clearly there is a battle between E. ictaluri andthe catfish host for iron (34, 35, 45, 46, 63), where the E. ictaluriheme-hemoglobin acquisition system becomes a lethal weaponcontributing to the systemic infection of the fish. However, thisheme-hemoglobin acquisition system needs to be tightly regu-lated and synthesized at a precise time and location within thehost.Fur protein is a global regulator that controls genes related toacquisition of iron and other divalent metal ions and genes relatedto bacterial catabolism, affecting virulence. We determined that E.ictaluri Fur regulates genes related to iron acquisition and hemesynthesis as well as Mg2\ufffd and Mn2\ufffd uptake (Fig. 9). Fur alsoregulates genes related to heme biosynthesis (hemF), where, in theabsence of iron, the bacterial cell has to preserve the integrity ofthe electron transport chain parts and respiration by upregulatingthe synthesis of tetrapyrroles such as heme. On the other hand, Furregulates catabolism of sugars by regulation of gmpA, linking theavailability of nutrients to the availability of essential ion metals.The gmpA gene encodes a phosphoglycerate mutase that is regu-lated by Fur in E. coli (19) and Salmonella (69). Here we havedescribed that Fur contributes to the regulation of gmpA in E.ictaluri (Fig. 9). This indicates that Fur participates in the generalregulation of metabolic pathways, linking bacterial growth to thesupply of key nutrients such as iron. We found a cyclic AMP re-ceptor protein (Crp) binding box in the fur promoter region (seeFig. S2 in the supplemental material), which is conserved in E. coliand Salmonella fur promoters (19, 69). Crp may link expression ofthe Fur regulator to the availability of carbon sources.The main described virulence factors in Edwardsiella are thetype III secretion system, required for cell invasion and survival inEdwardsiella-containing vesicles in macrophages, and the type VIsecretion system, required for full virulence (66, 68, 75). The Ed-wardsiella type III and VI secretion systems, as well as the tran-scriptional regulators EsrB and EsrC, are very similar in E. tardaand E. ictaluri (66, 68, 75). Recently the linkage of Fur with viru-lence in E. tarda has been reported (6). Fur regulates the type VIsecretion system-mediated repression of evpP gene expression (atype VI secretion effector), binding to its promoter region andblocking the binding of the EsrC activator (6). We did not findeither an E. ictaluri evpP gene ortholog or a Fur binding box at thepromoter region of the evpA gene or E. ictaluri type VI secretionsystem (data not shown). Protein-protein interaction between Furand EsrC or between Fur and EsrB response regulators was de-scribed for E. tarda (6). Although we did not find a Fur bindingbox in the type III secretion system or in the type VI secretionsystem of E. ictaluri, it is possible that Fur influences the virulenceof E. ictaluri-mediated protein-protein interaction as was de-scribed in E. tarda.Salmonella \ufffdfur mutants are attenuated in mammals when ad-ministered orally (51) or intraperitoneally (16) but are not veryimmunogenic (11). However, \ufffdfur mutants constitutively synthe-size their IROMPs, exposing them to the immune system of thehost. Although E. ictaluri \ufffdfur is not an efficient vaccine comparedto the recently described E. ictaluri \ufffdcrp mutant (55), the fur geneis an evolutionarily conserved regulon that controls iron homeo-stasis and bacterial virulence. Therefore, deletion of fur is an effec-tive modification for live attenuated vaccines and can be com-bined with other deletions, such as that of crp, to improve thesafety and immunogenicity of the vaccines.In summary, we conclude that E. ictaluri does not secret detect-able siderophores under the growth conditions tested, regardlessof the presence or absence of Fur and iron. Fur regulates a heme-hemoglobin uptake system in E. ictaluri, and deletion of fur can besuccessfully used as a means to attenuate E. ictaluri in order todevelop effective immersion live attenuated vaccines for the aqua-culture industry.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by USDA grant CRIS-ARZR-2009-01801 andComisi\u00f3n Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica (CONICYT),Gesti\u00f3n Propia Fellowship, Chile.We thank Jacquelyn Kilbourne for assistance at The Biodesign Insti-tute, Arizona State University.
