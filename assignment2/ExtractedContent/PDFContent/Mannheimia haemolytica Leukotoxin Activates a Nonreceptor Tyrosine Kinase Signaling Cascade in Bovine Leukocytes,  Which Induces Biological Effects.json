E. BRIGGS,2 P. THUMBIKAT,1 AND S. K. MAHESWARAN1*Department of Veterinary PathoBiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota,St. Paul, Minnesota 55108,1 and National Animal Disease Center, United StatesDepartment of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa 500102Received 22 March 2001/Returned for modification 11 June 2001/Accepted 6 July 2001The leukotoxin (LktA) produced by Mannheimia haemolytica binds to bovine lymphocyte function-associatedantigen 1 (LFA-1) and induces biological effects in bovine leukocytes in a cellular and species-specific fashion.We have previously shown that LktA also binds to porcine LFA-1 without eliciting any effects. These findingssuggest that the specificity of LktA effects must entail both binding to LFA-1 and activation of signalingpathways which are present in bovine leukocytes. However, the signaling pathways leading to biological effectsupon LktA binding to LFA-1 have not been characterized. In this context, several reports have indicated thatligand binding to LFA-1 results in activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) signaling cascade. Wedesigned experiments with the following objectives: (i) to determine whether LktA binding to LFA-1 leads toactivation of NRTKs, (ii) to examine whether LktA-induced NRTK activation is target cell specific, and (iii) todetermine whether LktA-induced NRTK activation is required for biological effects. We used a biologicallyinactive mutant leukotoxin (\ufffdLktA) for comparison with LktA. Our results indicate that LktA induces tyrosinephosphorylation (TP) of the CD18 tail of LFA-1 in bovine leukocytes. The \ufffdLktA mutant does not induce TPof the CD18 tail, albeit binding to bovine LFA-1. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail was attenuated by an NRTKinhibitor, herbimycin A; a phosphatidylinositol 3\ufffd-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin; and a Src kinaseinhibitor, PP2, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, LktA induces TP of the CD18 tail inbovine, but not porcine, leukocytes. Moreover, LktA-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2\ufffd]i) elevation was alsoinhibited by herbimycin A, wortmannin, and PP2. Thus, our data represent the first evidence that binding ofLktA to bovine LFA-1 induces a species-specific NRTK signaling cascade involving PI 3-kinase and Src kinasesand that this signaling cascade is required for LktA-induced biological effects.Bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (BPP) caused by Mannhe-imia (Pasteurella) haemolytica serotype 1 remains a major eco-nomic problem for the beef and dairy cattle industries in NorthAmerica and Western Europe (2, 10, 14, 47). The leukotoxin(LktA) produced by this bacterium is the primary virulencefactor that contributes to the pathogenesis of the fibrinonecro-tizing pleuropneumonia and death characteristic of this disease(7, 8, 43, 44). A large body of evidence indicates that much ofthe lung injury in this disease is caused by inflammatory me-diators released from alveolar leukocytes by LktA-induced ac-tivation and cytolysis (11, 34, 41, 48).LktA is a member of a family of gram-negative RTX (re-peats in toxin) cytolysins (12, 20). Unlike most other RTXcytolysins, leukotoxins produced by Actinobacillus actinomyce-temcomitans (LtxA) and M. haemolytica (LktA) demonstratecell-type-specific and species-specific biological effects. TheLtxA of A. actinomycetemcomitans, which causes dental cariesin humans, interacts only with cells of the lymphocytic andmonomyelocytic lineages of humans and some nonhuman pri-mates and provokes biological effects (29); the LktA of M.haemolytica interacts only with ruminant leukocytes and plate-lets and induces biological effects (6, 25, 37). A study by Lallyet al. (30) reported that human lymphocyte function-associatedantigen 1 (LFA-1), a member of the \ufffd2 integrins, is a target cellreceptor for LtxA of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Three studieshave identified bovine CD18, the \ufffd subunit of all three bovine\ufffd2 integrins (LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95), as a receptor for M.haemolytica LktA (3, 33, 42). However, in these studies nospecific member of the \ufffd2 integrin family was identified as anLktA receptor. We have extended these observations and haveshown that bovine LFA-1, but not other members of the \ufffd2integrin family, is a receptor for M. haemolytica LktA (23).LFA-1 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein consisting of CD11a(\ufffd) and noncovalently bound CD18 (\ufffd) subunits and is exclu-sively expressed on leukocytes (5, 13). LFA-1 is critically in-volved in neutrophil transmigration from blood into the un-derlying tissue at sites of inflammation by binding to severalmembers of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) fam-ily on endothelial cells. Cumulative evidence suggests thatICAM-1 binding to LFA-1 results in signaling through activa-tion of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) (28, 40). AmongNRTKs, focal adhesion kinase, the Src family of kinases, andphosphatidylinositiol 3\ufffd-kinase (PI 3-kinase) have been studiedin more detail (40). Several intracellular proteins, includingCbl (45), phospholipase C (26), and the LFA-1 (CD11a andCD18) cytoplasmic tails (15), have been identified as key sub-* Corresponding author.

SinceLktA is known to induce biological effects only in ruminantleukocytes (25, 37), these results indicate that binding of LktAto LFA-1 does not reflect biological specificity. In the light ofthis finding, it is reasonable to hypothesize that although LktAbinds to both susceptible and nonsusceptible leukocytes, onlysusceptible (bovine) leukocytes undergo the signaling cascadesthat lead to biological effects.Earlier studies have demonstrated that the interaction ofLktA with bovine leukocytes induces intracellular calcium([Ca2\ufffd]i) elevation (9, 17, 21, 22, 36). Elevation of [Ca2\ufffd]iappears to be critical for LktA-induced NF-\ufffdB activation (21),proinflammatory cytokine gene expression (21), and arachi-donic acid release and cytolysis (24). The mechanisms under-lying LktA-induced [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation appear complex but in-volve activation of Gi-type G proteins, phospholipases, andarachidonic acid generation (22). However, the initial signalingevents that follow binding of LktA to LFA-1 and lead to thebiological effects have not been examined.The objectives of the present study were to determinewhether (i) LktA binding to LFA-1 results in activation ofNRTKs, (ii) NRTK activation is target cell (bovine leukocyte)specific, and (iii) NRTK activation is required for LktA-in-duced biological effects. We used TP of LFA-1 tails as amarker for activation of NRTKs and [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation as anindex of LktA-induced biological effects. We used bovine al-veolar macrophages (BAMs) in this study as target cells sincethese cells are uniquely positioned in the alveolar spaces forinitial interaction with LktA and to initiate the inflammatorycascade in BPP. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) wereused to demonstrate whether LktA-induced signaling showstarget cell specificity.MATERIALS AND METHODSM. haemolytica strains. Two strains of M. haemolytica were used in this study:wild-type strain D153 was isolated from the lungs of a steer that died of pneu-monic pasteurellosis, and an isogenic mutant defective in the lktA gene wasconstructed by allelic replacement from the parent wild-type strain D153. Con-struction of the isogenic mutant was performed in a manner similar to onedescribed in a previous publication (41). The mutant \ufffdlktA has an in-framedeletion in the lktA gene corresponding to amino acids 34 to 378. The \ufffdlktAmutant produced other wild-type antigens of M. haemolytica plus a 66-kDa\ufffdLktA protein which lacked cytolytic activity with bovine leukocytes (unpub-lished data).Preparation of LktA. The production and purification of native LktA from M.haemolytica wild-type strain D153 has been described previously (48). Mutant\ufffdLktA was produced and purified in a similar manner. The purities of theseleukotoxins were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis and they were stored in alyophilized state at \ufffd20\u00b0C until use. The bioactivity of native LktA was quanti-fied by a colorimetric assay with XTT [sodium 3\ufffd-(1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate], using bovinelymphoma cells (BL-3) as the target cells; bioactivity was expressed as LktA unitsper milligram (dry weight). Since \ufffdLktA lacked bioactivity, in experiments in-volving \ufffdLktA a protein concentration equivalent to that of native LktA wasused. Purified LktA and \ufffdLktA were tested for the presence of lipopolysaccha-ride (LPS) contamination using the chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assaykit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md.), and the levels of LPS were found to be 1.3and 1.8 endotoxin units per mg (dry weight), respectively. In order to exclude theeffect of this LPS contamination in the LktA and \ufffdLktA preparations, they wereincubated with 10 \ufffdg of polymyxin B per ml for 30 min on ice prior to use. Allstudies were performed with the same batch of leukotoxins.Preparation of M. haemolytica LPS. The M. haemolytica LPS was prepared bya hot phenol-water method described elsewhere (22). Purified LPS was stored ina lyophilized state at 4\u00b0C. The chromogenic Limulus amebocyte assay (BioWhit-taker) was used to measure the bioactivity of LPS. One milligram of purified LPScontained 2.086 \t 105 endotoxin units.Preparation of leukocytes. (i) BAMs. BAMs were isolated by bronchoalveolarlavage of 6- to 8-week-old healthy calves as described previously (48). The purityand viability of cells were determined by nonspecific esterase staining (SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and trypan blue exclusion (Sigma), respectively.Only populations of cells that were 98% pure and viable were used in ourexperiments.(ii) PAMs. PAMs were isolated from 5- to 7-week-old healthy pigs as describedin a previous publication (21). As with BAMs, the purity and viability of PAMswere determined by nonspecific esterase staining and trypan blue exclusion,respectively. Only populations of cells that were 98% pure and viable wereused in our experiments.MAbs. The properties and applications of the various anti-\ufffd2 integrin mono-clonal antibodies (MAbs) used in the present study were previously described(23). MAbs MUC76A (anti-porcine CD11a; W. C. Davis, personal communica-tion), MM12A (anti-bovine CD11b), BAQ153A (anti-bovine CD11c), BAT75A(anti-bovine CD18), and BAQ30A (anti-bovine CD18) were purchased as ascitesfluid from VMRD, Inc. (Pullman, Wash.). MAbs R15.7 (anti-canine CD18) andR3.1 (anti-canine CD11a) were a gift from R. Rothlein (Boehringer IngelheimPharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, Conn.). MUC76A, R15.7, and R3.1 cross-reactwith the bovine homologue (23). The anti-LktA neutralizing MAb601 and anti-LktA nonneutralizing MAb605 (16) were a generous gift from S. Srikumaran(University of Nebraska, Lincoln). An irrelevant, isotype-matched control MAb(MOPC21) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.Flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis of \ufffd2 integrins on BAMs was per-formed as described previously (1, 23). Briefly, 107 cells were incubated with 1 \ufffdgof anti-\ufffd2 integrin MAbs or control MAb (EL112) in fluorescence-activated cellsorter (FACS) buffer for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed using FACS buffer andincubated with 1:200 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) inFACS buffer for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended in 100 \ufffdl ofFACS buffer and fluorescence was analyzed by a FACScalibur flow cytometrysystem (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.). In eachexperiment, 50,000 cells were analyzed and the results were expressed as meanfluorescence intensity (MFI). To examine whether pretreatment with NRTKinhibitors influenced the expression of LFA-1, BAMs were pretreated withherbimycin A (a broad-spectrum inhibitor of NRTKs), wortmannin (a specificinhibitor of PI 3-type NRTK), PP2 (a selective inhibitor of the Src family ofNRTK), or PP3 (the inactive analog of PP2) and washed, and the cells wereprepared for FACS analysis as described above. In another set of experiments,we examined the effects of these inhibitors on LktA binding to LFA-1 using anindirect method. In these experiments, the NRTK inhibitors at specific concen-trations were added to BAMs (107 cells), incubated for 10 min, and washed, and50 U of LktA per ml was added. After incubation, the cells were washed,incubated with MAbs against LFA-1, and subjected to FACS analysis. LktAbinding to LFA-1 was calculated using the following formula: percent LktAbinding to LFA-1 \ufffd [(MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbs \ufffd MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbsafter pretreatment with LktA)/MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbs] \t 100. The back-ground MFI (without primary MAbs) was subtracted in all experiments.Leukotoxin binding assay. Affinity chromatography was used to demonstrate\ufffdLktA binding to bovine LFA-1 as described previously (23). Briefly, 0.125-in.-diameter polystyrene beads were incubated with 20 \ufffdg of purified \ufffdLktA in 2 mlof phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rocking. Thebeads were then washed once with PBS and incubated with 1% bovine serumalbumin (BSA) to block the remaining protein binding sites on the beads.Polystyrene beads coated with 1% BSA served as a control. One hundred twentymicrograms of protein from BAM lysates was diluted 1:3 with PBS containing 1mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 and incubated with the \ufffdLkt- or BSA-coated beadsfor 15 h at 4\u00b0C. In another set of experiments, \ufffdLkt-coated beads were prein-cubated with 10 \ufffdg of anti-Lkt neutralizing MAb (MAb601) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C beforeadding them to BAM lysates. The beads were then washed once with PBS, andthe bound proteins were eluted from the beads by being boiled with 50 \ufffdl ofSDS-PAGE loading buffer and electrophoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradientpolyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. Western blotting was per-formed as described below.Preparation of affinity column. Five hundred milligrams of CNBr-activatedSepharose 4B beads (Sigma Chemical Co.) was suspended in 20 ml of cold 1 mM6132 JEYASEELAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.HCl and packed into a 15-ml column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The resultingcolumn was then washed with 15 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 and 0.5M NaCl). Anti-bovine CD18 MAb (BAT75A) or isotype-matched irrelevantMAb (MOPC21) was diluted in coupling buffer at a concentration of 1 mg perml of column volume, added to the column, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C onan orbital shaker. The antibody mixture was drained off the column, 8 ml of 1 Mglycine was added to block nonspecific sites on the beads, and the beads wereincubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on an orbital shaker. The glycine was drained off andthe column was washed twice with 10 ml of acetate buffer (pH 4.0), followed bywashing with Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The column was then washed with 10 ml ofelution buffer (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mMNaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The beads were finally washed with enough washbuffer (Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution [HBSS] containing 1 mM calcium andmagnesium, 10 mM NaN3, and phenol red indicator) until the pH of the columnbeads returned to neutral. Approximately 1.5 ml of wash buffer was left on thecolumn, and the column was capped and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Sepharose beads(without MAb) were also prepared by the same procedure and used to preclearcell lysates to remove nonspecifically reacting lysate proteins from the Sepharosebeads (preclear bead slurry).Activation of NRTKs upon LFA-1 engagement with leukotoxin. (i) Leukocyteactivation. One hundred microliters (108 per ml) of BAMs or PAMs was exposedto LktA, \ufffdLktA, or LPS for different time periods in calcium- and magnesium-containing HBSS. Thereafter, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated, and ana-lyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for the detection of TP byusing MAb 4G10. TP of LFA-1 was used as a marker for leukotoxin-inducedsignaling. To demonstrate that leukotoxin-induced TP of the LFA-1 tails wasindeed specific, cells were preincubated with anti-\ufffd2 antibodies before exposureto leukotoxins.In some experiments, PAMs were exposed to MAb MUC76A. Unpublisheddata from our laboratory revealed that MUC76A antibody was bound to theextracellular portion of LFA-1 in PAMs and activated the cells, as evidenced byelevation of [Ca2\ufffd]i. In these experiments, anti-bovine CD18 (BAT75A), anti-canine CD18 (R15.7), and anti-canine CD11a (R3.1) were used as negativecontrols. The cells were then prepared for analysis of TP of the LFA-1 tails asdescribed below.(ii) Preparation of cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared as previously de-scribed (23). Briefly, BAMs or PAMs were harvested and incubated for 2 days at37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s modifiedEagle\u2019s medium (Sigma) containing 2 mM L-glutamine to reach quiescence. Toassess LktA-induced TP of LFA-1 tails, cells were exposed to LktA or \ufffdLktA incalcium- and magnesium-containing HBSS. After exposure, cells were incubatedat 37\u00b0C for 0 to 10 min with 100 \ufffdl of 2\t lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.65],1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2% Triton X-100, 100 \ufffdg of aprotinin per ml, 100\ufffdg of leupeptin per ml, 10 \ufffdg of pepstatin per ml, and 2 mM phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride) to terminate the reaction and lyse the cells. Lysates were usedimmediately for immunoprecipitation as described below.(iii) Immunoprecipitation. Aliquots (100 \ufffdl) of cell lysates were precleared bysuspending them in 50 \ufffdl of precleared bead slurry and the mixture was dilutedto a final volume of 200 \ufffdl with wash buffer in a microcentrifuge tube. Themixture was incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C on an orbital shaker. The mixture was thencentrifuged at 100 \t g for 5 min and the supernatant containing precleared celllysates was collected and transferred into a new tube. Twenty microliters of aslurry of Sepharose beads coated with BAT75A (anti-CD18) or MOPC21 (con-trol) was added to the precleared cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Afterincubation, the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. Thepellet was washed three times with 200 \ufffdl of wash buffer, 50 \ufffdl of elution bufferwas added, and the suspension was vortexed gently for 30 s and pelleted bycentrifugation.(iv) SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Aliquots (25 \ufffdl) of 2\t SDS-PAGEloading buffer (without 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to each tube containingthe immunoprecipitated proteins (pellet), boiled for 4 min, loaded, and resolvedon SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradient gels under nonreducing conditions. Separated pro-teins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane andsubjected to Western blotting as previously described (23). Briefly, the mem-brane was blocked with a blocking solution, followed by incubation with 0.5 \ufffdgof antiphosphotyrosine MAb (4G10) per ml in 10% blocking solution for 1 h atroom temperature. Membranes were then washed four times with PBS contain-ing 0.25% Tween 20 (PBST), followed by incubation with a 1:50,000 dilution ofhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 1 h atroom temperature. The blots were washed five times with PBST and developedusing the SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence detection system. For re-peated Western blotting, membranes were stripped by incubating the membranein a buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and2% SDS for 45 min in a 65\u00b0C water bath. The membranes were rinsed with PBSTtwice and blocked with PBST containing 10% blocking solution before themembrane was reprobed by using the immunoblotting procedure describedabove. Stripped membranes were reprobed with anti-CD11a (MUC76A) andanti-CD18 (BAQ30A) MAbs to validate uniform protein loading on gels.Determination of intracellular calcium in BAMs. [Ca2\ufffd]i was measured byvideo fluorescence imaging as previously described (21, 22). Briefly, BAMsgrown on glass coverslips were incubated in HBSS containing 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2mM MgCl2, and 5 \ufffdM fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2-AM) at 37\u00b0C for 30min. The cells were then washed in HBSS, the coverslips were placed on thestage of a Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Inc., Garden City, N.Y.), and thecells were viewed using a 40\t fluor objective. The microscope was coupled to adigitally controlled filter wheel (DG-4; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, Calif.),which contains excitation filters for 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths. Aphotometric Cool Snap CCD 12-bit camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, Ariz.) wasused to measure fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. The outputof the digital camera was sampled by a digital computer (Universal ImagingCorp., West Chester, Pa.). Fluorescence signals were determined from regions ofinterest and images were corrected for system background, shading errors, andthe very low autofluorescence of the unloaded cells. [Ca2\ufffd]i was calculated by theratio method described by Grynkiewicz et al. (18).Treatment with inhibitors. BAMs were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min withherbimycin A, wortmannin, PP2, or PP3 before exposure to LktA. The choice ofthe various inhibitors used in this study was based on their reported specificity fortheir respective targets. Appropriate vehicle controls were included in the me-dium in all experiments. Five different concentrations of the inhibitors aroundtheir respective 50% inhibitory concentrations were used in the present study toexclude any potential nonspecific effects of the inhibitors. Viability of cells wasassessed after treatments with inhibitors by using the trypan blue exclusion assay,and only cell populations showing 98% viability were used in our studies.Reagents. RPMI 1640 was purchased from BioWhittaker. Herbimycin A,wortmannin, PP2, and PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, Calif.).Fura-2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). Dulbecco\u2019smodified Eagle\u2019s medium, HBSS, antibiotics, and glutamine were purchasedfrom Gibco BRL (Grand Island, N.Y.). Polystyrene beads were obtained fromOrange Products, Inc. (Allentown, Pa.). SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels andsample buffer were purchased from Bio-Rad. Blocking solution was purchasedfrom Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, Md.). Antiphosphoty-rosine MAb 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid,N.Y.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulinG was obtained from ICN Biomedical Research Products (Costa Mesa, Calif.).PVDF membrane and SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence substrate wereobtained from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, Ill.). Sodium orthovanadate,Triton X-100, Tween 20, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and BSA were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed using a one-way analysis of varianceand expressed as the mean plus the standard error of mean. The term significantis used here to indicate a P value of less than 0.05.RESULTSExpression of \ufffd2 integrins in BAMs. Flow cytometry wasused to determine the expression of various \ufffd2 integrins inBAMs. As shown in Fig. 1, BAMs express high levels of CD11aand CD18 and low levels of CD11b and CD11c. To determinewhether inhibitors used in the present study had any effect onLFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) expression, cells were pretreated with 1\ufffdM herbimycin A or 5 \ufffdM concentrations of wortmannin,PP2, or PP3 for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Pretreatment of cells withthese inhibitors did not have any significant effect on LFA-1expression (data not shown). To examine whether pretreat-ment with inhibitors influenced LktA binding to its receptorLFA-1, BAMs were pretreated with the same inhibitors at theconcentrations indicated above for 10 min at 37\u00b0C before ex-posure to LktA. Pretreatment of BAMs with inhibitors did nothave any significant effect on LktA binding to LFA-1 (Fig. 2).Leukotoxin-induced TP of LFA-1 tails in BAMs. Resultsshowed that the mutant Lkt (\ufffdLktA) indeed bound to LFA-1VOL. 69, 2001 TYROSINE KINASE SIGNALING BY M. HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6133of bovine macrophages and this binding was specific (Fig. 3).To examine whether leukotoxin binding to bovine LFA-1 leadsto activation of signaling cascades, we determined the extent ofTP of the cytoplasmic tails of LFA-1. BAMs were exposed toLktA or \ufffdLktA and lysed, and the lysate was subjected toimmunoprecipitation with either anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A)or an irrelevant control MAb (MOPC21). TP of LFA-1 tailswas determined by Western blot analysis of the immunopre-cipitates by using antiphosphotyrosine MAb. Exposure ofBAMs to the biologically active LktA, but not the inactivemutant \ufffdLktA, induced TP of the CD18 tail but not the CD11atail (Fig. 4). Exposure of BAMs to neutralized LktA (withanti-LktA MAb [MAb601]) abolished TP of the CD18 tail(Fig. 4). By contrast, LktA incubated with a nonneutralizinganti-LktA antibody (MAb605) or irrelevant control MAb(MOPC21) did not block TP of the CD18 tail (data notshown). Furthermore, LPS, even at 1 \ufffdg/ml (1,000-fold greaterthan the cellular activation concentration), did not induce TPof the CD18 tail (Fig. 4). TP of the CD18 tail was not detectedby immunoprecipitation of lysates with MOPC21-coatedbeads, demonstrating specificity (Fig. 4). Preincubation of cellswith antibodies directed against CD11a or CD18, but not thoseagainst CD11b or CD11c, inhibited LktA-induced TP of theCD18 tail (Fig. 5). LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail wasdetectable at 30 s, peaked at 2 min, and was undetectable at 10min following exposure to 50 U of LktA per ml (data notshown).Effects of NRTK inhibitors on LktA-induced TP of the CD18tail. Since NRTKs are known to induce TP of LFA-1 tails (15),we determined their role in LktA-induced signaling. BAMswere preexposed to various selective NRTK inhibitors. Herbi-mycin A, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of NRTKs, inhibited TPof the CD18 tail in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6).Preexposure of cells to wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of thePI 3-kinase-type of NRTK, also inhibited LktA-induced TP ofthe CD18 tail in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 7). Inaddition, preexposure of cells to PP2, the selective inhibitor ofthe Src family of NRTKs, inhibited LktA-induced TP of theCD18 tail (Fig. 7). Preexposure of cells to PP3, an inactiveanalog of PP2, had no significant effect on LktA-induced TP ofthe CD18 tail, indicating that the inhibition by PP2 was specific(Fig. 7).Species specificity of LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail. Wehave previously shown that LktA binds to PAMs, a nonsuscep-tible cell type, without eliciting any biological effects (23). Todetermine whether this binding leads to any NRTK signalingcascade in PAMs, we examined TP of the CD18 tail. Exposureof PAMs to LktA did not induce TP of the CD18 tail (Fig. 8).However, an activating MAb against porcine CD11a (MUC76A)induced TP of the CD18 tail in PAMs (Fig. 8). PAMs exposedto various other anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs did not in-duce TP of the CD18 tail (Fig. 8).Role of tyrosine kinase activation in LktA-induced [Ca2\ufffd]ielevation.

All three inhibitors blocked LktA-in-duced [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation in a time- (data not shown) and concen- tration-dependent (Fig. 9) manner. The inactive analogue ofPP2, PP3, did not block LktA-induced [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation (Fig. 9).DISCUSSIONAlthough much progress has been made in the identificationand characterization of the receptor for RTX toxins of A.actinomycetemcomitans (LtxA) and M. haemolytica (LktA) inleukocytes, the intracellular signaling events that immediatelyfollow leukotoxin interaction with LFA-1 and lead to biologicaleffects are not understood. We have provided evidence thatbinding of M. haemolytica LktA to bovine LFA-1 induces TP ofthe CD18, but not the CD11a, tail of LFA-1. A previous studydemonstrated that LFA-1 does not possess any intrinsic ty-rosine kinase activity and therefore the tyrosyl residues presentin the cytoplasmic tails of LFA-1 can only be phosphorylatedby cytoplasmic NRTKs (15). It is also important that the CD18subunit of LFA-1 has one tyrosyl residue in its cytoplasmicdomain in both the human (27) and bovine (38) forms and,therefore, is accessible to intracellular NTRKs for phosphor-ylation. Although no tyrosyl residues are present in the cyto-plasmic domain of the human CD11a subunit, it does have atyrosine residue located in the transmembrane domain that iscloser to the cytoplasmic domain, which seems accessible toNRTKs (15). Our results are different from a previous findingwith human leukocytes where collagen binding to LFA-1 wasFIG. 2. LktA binding to LFA-1 is not influenced by herbimycin A,wortmannin, PP2, or PP3 as determined by flow cytometry. Cells werepreincubated with medium alone or medium containing herbimycin A(Her A; 1 \ufffdM), wortmannin (Wort; 5 \ufffdM), PP2 (5 \ufffdM), or PP3 (5\ufffdM), washed, and exposed to LktA. Thereafter, the cells were washedand incubated with anti-LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) MAb followed by in-cubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Re-sults are expressed as the percent LktA binding to LFA-1, according tothe following formula: % LktA binding to LFA-1 \ufffd [(MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAb \ufffd MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAb after pretreatment withLktA)/MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAb] \t 100. Means and standard errors(indicated by error bars) of three experiments are shown.FIG. 3. Biologically inactive \ufffdLktA binds to bovine LFA-1. BAMlysates were incubated with \ufffdLktA- or BSA-coated beads for 15 h at4\u00b0C as described in Materials and Methods. Bound proteins from thebeads were then eluted, electrophoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradi-ent polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, andanalyzed by Western blotting using anti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (A) or anti-CD11a (MUC76A) (B) MAb. Cell lysates from BAMs show 90- and85-kDa CD18 bands and a 180-kDa CD11a band (panels A and B, lane1). The eluant from \ufffdLkt-coated beads that were reacted with BAMlysates contained 90- and 85-kDa CD18 bands and a 180-kDa CD11aband (panels A and B, lane 2). In the eluant from Lkt-coated beadspreincubated with anti-Lkt MAb (MAb601) before adding BAM ly-sates or in the eluant from BSA-coated beads incubated with BAMlysates, no CD18 bands or CD11a bands were observed (panels A andB, lanes 3 and 4). The data are from one representative experiment ofthree experiments performed.FIG. 4. LktA interaction with BAMs results in TP of the CD18 tail.BAMs were incubated for 2 min at 37\u00b0C with LktA (lane 1), no LktA(lane 2), \ufffdLktA (lane 3), LktA preincubated with anti-LktA (MAb601; lane 4), or LPS (1 \ufffdg/ml; lane 5). Cell lysates were immunopre-cipitated with anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A; lanes 1 to 5) or an irrelevantcontrol antibody (MOPC21; lane 6), electrophoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF mem-brane. The blot was developed with antiphosphotyrosine MAb (panelsA and B). The membrane was stripped and reprobed sequentially withanti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (C) or anti-CD11a (MUC76A) (D) MAb. Onlythe biologically active LktA induced TP of the CD18 tail, but not of theCD11a tail, as indicated by an arrow on the left of panel A, lane 1. Thedata are from one representative experiment of three experimentsperformed. Molecular masses are shown in kilodaltons.VOL. 69, 2001 TYROSINE KINASE SIGNALING BY M. HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6135shown to induce TP of both the CD18 and CD11a tails (15).One possible explanation for this difference is that the tyrosylresidue in the bovine CD11a subunit might not be accessible toNTRKs. The elucidation of this possibility is hampered by thefact that bovine CD11a has not been cloned.Efforts to purify LktA and other RTX toxins by a variety ofmethods have invariably been confounded by the presence ofbiologically significant levels of LPS contamination in postpu-rification samples (12, 32), leading investigators to proposethat LPS could contribute to the LktA-induced effects. ThatTP of the CD18 tail was indeed caused by LktA, and not by anycontaminating LPS, is supported by the following observations:(i) LPS itself, even at a concentration of 1 \ufffdg/ml, failed toinduce TP of the CD18 tail; (ii) while LktA-neutralizing MAbsabrogated TP of the CD18 tail, a nonneutralizing anti-LktMAb or control MAb did not block TP of the CD18 tail; and(iii) we have shown previously that 10 \ufffdg of polymyxin B perml completely abrogated the biological effects induced inBAMs by M. haemolytica LPS at concentrations as high as 1\ufffdg/ml (21\u201324). Polymyxin B was routinely included in ourstudies to eliminate any LPS-induced effects. In the presentstudy, there was no LPS-induced TP of the CD18 tail in theabsence of serum, indicating that the LPS-induced signalingpathway is different from the LktA-induced signaling cascadein bovine leukocytes. In this regard, we have shown previouslythat LPS activation of bovine leukocytes requires a CD14-dependent pathway, since it can only be demonstrated in thepresence of serum, which contains LPS-binding proteins (21,22).The observations of the present study indicate that the CD18tail of the LFA-1, but not other members of the \ufffd2 integrins(Mac-1 and p150,95), undergoes TP of the CD18 tail uponLktA engagement. This conclusion is supported by the factthat TP of the CD18 tail was blocked by anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs, but not by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c MAbs. Inthis context, results from a previous study showed that LFA-1is a receptor for M. haemolytica LktA, and LktA binding toBAMs was abolished by anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs butnot by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c MAbs (23). Moreover, onlyanti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs inhibited LktA-induced bio-logical effects in BAMs (23). Together, these data also indicatethat TP of the CD18 tail results from LktA binding to LFA-1in bovine leukocytes.In the present study, we observed that the biologically inac-tive \ufffdLktA, which lacks amino acid residues 34 to 378 at theN-terminal end, also binds to bovine LFA-1 (Fig. 4). However,this binding does not lead to TP of the CD18 tail, suggestingthat TP of the CD18 tail requires the binding of a full-lengthLktA to LFA-1. The absence of TP with \ufffdLktA binding toLFA-1 may be attributable to the following possibilities: (i)in-frame deletions may alter the proper conformation of\ufffdLktA that is required for high-affinity binding to target cellsand elicit TP of the CD18 tail, and/or (ii) the missing N-terminal amino acids in the \ufffdLktA mutant may be required forbinding to an additional cell surface molecule in target cells inorder to induce TP of the CD18 tail after interacting with theprimary receptor, LFA-1.In porcine leukocytes, a non-target cell type, LktA does notinduce TP of the CD18 tail. Additionally, we have previouslyshown that LktA binds to porcine LFA-1 without inducing anybiological effects (23). Other studies (35) have demonstratedthe existence of distinct prelytic and lytic conformations of theEscherichia coli hemolysin, an RTX cytolysin, suggesting thatupon toxin binding to its receptor the toxin undergoes a con-formational change prior to exerting its lytic effect. A similarFIG. 5. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is blocked by anti-LFA-1(CD11a/CD18) MAbs. BAMs were preincubated with 5 \ufffdg of variousanti-\ufffd2 integrin MAbs for 30 min at 37\u00b0C before exposure to LktA for2 min at 37\u00b0C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD18MAb (BAT75A), electrophoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradient poly-acrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot wasfirst developed with antiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and re-probed with anti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (B). Anti-CD18 and anti-CD11a(lanes 5 and 6), but not anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c (lanes 3 and 4),blocked LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail. The arrow at the left ofpanel A indicates the position of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. Thedata shown are from one representative experiment of three experi-ments performed.FIG. 6. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is inhibited by herbimy-cin A. BAMs were preincubated with 0.06 to 1 \ufffdM herbimycin A for10 min at 37\u00b0C before exposure to LktA for 2 min at 37\u00b0C. Cell lysateswere immunoprecipitated with anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A), electro-phoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and trans-ferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was first developed withantiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and reprobed with anti-CD18MAb (BAQ30A) (B). The arrow at the left of panel A indicates theposition of the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. The data shown are onerepresentative experiment of four experiments performed.6136 JEYASEELAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.mechanism may underlie the LktA effects in target and non-target cells, and we speculate that a conformational changeoccurs in bovine leukocytes, but not porcine leukocytes, uponLktA binding. These results are consistent with the hypothesisthat TP of the CD18 tail reflects the species specificity of Lkteffects.In human neutrophils, binding of collagen to LFA-1 inducesTP of the LFA-1 tails through herbimycin A-sensitive NRTKs(15). Using selective inhibitors, we demonstrated in thepresent study that the involvement of herbimycin A-sensitiveNRTKs, including Src kinases and PI 3-kinase, in LktA in-duced signaling through LFA-1. Although activation ofNRTKs in bacterial exotoxin-induced signaling has not beenstudied, its role in endotoxin (LPS)-induced signaling has beendescribed in detail (4, 19, 39). LPS is known to induce activa-tion of Src kinases, leading to PI 3-kinase activation (19). Srckinases are known to activate not only the tyrosine kinase-dependent isoform of PI 3-kinase (p85/p110\ufffd) but also thetyrosine kinase-independent isoforms (p85/p110\ufffd or p85/p110\ufffd) (46). In bovine leukocytes, the inhibition of LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail by herbimycin A indicates theinvolvement of only the tyrosine-kinase dependent isoform.In bovine leukocytes, M. haemolytica LktA interaction leadsto [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation (9, 17, 21, 22, 23, 36). This [Ca2\ufffd]i eleva-tion is required for NF-\ufffdB activation (21), proinflammatorycytokine gene expression (21), and arachidonic acid releaseand cytolysis (24). This [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation is also a highly reg-ulated process involving activation of Gi-type G proteins andphospholipases C and A2 (22). In the present study, we dem-onstrated that LktA binding to LFA-1 results in activation ofan NRTK signaling cascade that is required for [Ca2\ufffd]i eleva-tion. Furthermore, the inhibition of LktA-induced TP of theCD18 tail by inhibitors of Src kinases and PI 3-kinase alsocauses attenuation of the [Ca2\ufffd]i elevation, indicating the im-portance of NRTK signaling in LktA-induced biological ef-fects. The mechanism(s) by which NRTK signaling cross talkswith Gi proteins and phospholipases in bovine leukocytes re-mains to be elucidated.In conclusion, our data provide the first direct evidence thatFIG. 7. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is inhibited by wortmannin and PP2, but not by PP3. BAMs were preincubated with 0.65 to 10 \ufffdMwortmannin, PP2, or PP3 before exposure to LktA for 2 min at 37\u00b0C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A),electrophoresed on an SDS\u20134-to-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was first developed withantiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and reprobed with anti-CD18 MAb (BAQ30A) (B). Wortmannin and PP2, but not PP3, inhibited TP ina concentration-dependent manner. The arrow at the left of panel A indicates the position of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. The data shown arefrom one representative experiment of three experiments performed.FIG. 8. LktA interaction with PAMs results in no TP of the CD18tail. However, anti-porcine CD11a (MUC76A; lane 4)\u2014but not anti-bovine CD18 (BAT75A, lane 3), anti-canine CD11a (R3.1, lane 5), oranti-canine CD18 (R15.7, lane 6)\u2014induces TP of the CD18 tail inPAMs. Cells were incubated with 50 U of LktA per ml or 5 \ufffdg ofvarious MAbs for 2 min at 37\u00b0C.

HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6137binding of LktA to bovine LFA-1 induces activation of anNRTK signaling cascade involving PI 3-kinase and Src kinases,and this signaling cascade is essential for LktA-induced bio-logical effects. This may represent a common mechanism ininflammation induced by RTX toxins of A. actinomycetem-comitans and M. haemolytica, whose receptor is LFA-1. Thesefindings allow us to speculate that M. haemolytica LktA utilizesthe eukaryotic cell adhesion molecule LFA-1 to induce aunique signaling cascade that leads to activation and cytolysisof bovine leukocytes in the alveolar spaces. This could releasea myriad of inflammatory mediators, leading to peracute lunginjury. A recent report (31) provided evidence that interleu-kin-1\ufffd upregulated LFA-1 expression and enhanced the bind-ing of LktA, thus amplifying its biological effects in bovineneutrophils. Taken together, if these events occur in the bovinelung, it might explain the severe uncontrolled inflammatoryresponse and irreversible lung injury seen in BPP. A betterunderstanding of the mechanisms by which M. haemolyticaLktA interacts with the LFA-1 receptor in pulmonary leuko-cytes and releases inflammatory mediators will provide newavenues for effective therapies to control BPP.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported in part by a grant from the MinnesotaAgricultural Experiment Station (S.K.M. and M.S.K.) and a USDA-NRI competitive grant (no. 35204-9230 to S.K.M. and M.S.K.).We thank Bruce Walcheck and Christie Malazdrewich for helpfuldiscussions.REFERENCES1.
