Crucial to the pathogenesis of thisintracellular pathogen is its ability to subvert host cell defenses, permitting intracellular replication inspecialized vacuoles within host cells. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates a largenumber of bacterial effectors into host cell, is absolutely required for rerouting the Legionella phagosome. ManyLegionella effectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, among which are protein kinase domains. In silicoanalysis and in vitro phosphorylation assays identified five functional protein kinases, LegK1 to LegK5,encoded by the epidemic L. pneumophila Lens strain. Except for LegK5, the Legionella protein kinases are allT4SS effectors. LegK2 plays a key role in bacterial virulence, as demonstrated by gene inactivation. The legK2mutant containing vacuoles displays less-efficient recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum markers, whichresults in delayed intracellular replication. Considering that a kinase-dead substitution mutant of legK2exhibits the same virulence defects, we highlight here a new molecular mechanism, namely, protein phosphor-ylation, developed by L. pneumophila to establish a replicative niche and evade host cell defenses.Legionella pneumophila is the most common causative agentof the atypical and severe pneumonia legionellosis. PathogenicLegionella strains emerge from the environment after intracel-lular multiplication in phagocytic protozoans. It has been pro-posed that its ability to exploit the basic cellular mechanisms ofnumerous protozoal hosts also enables Legionella to infecthuman macrophages of alveolar lungs and consequently tocause disease (29, 63).Mechanisms of infection of protozoans and macrophages byL. pneumophila are quite similar (24). Upon internalization ofL. pneumophila, the bacteria containing phagosome avoids fu-sion with lysosomes and recruits mitochondria and endoplas-mic reticulum (ER) to establish a replication niche. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocatesbacterial proteins called \u201ceffectors\u201d into host cell, is absolutelyrequired to reprogram the endosomal-lysosomal degradationpathway of the phagocytic cell and to lead to bacterial intra-cellular survival and successful replication (3, 5, 64, 67). Mul-tiple approaches have successfully identified more than 100effector proteins (reviewed by reference 22). Many Legionellaeffectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, such as thoseinvolved in protein-protein interactions (e.g., ankyrin repeats,leucine-rich repeats, and coiled coils), and domains with moredefined activities (protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases, sphin-gosine-1-phosphate lyases, phospholipases, and guanine nucle-otide exchange factors). In spite of the fact that L. pneumo-phila seems well equipped with proteins adapted to interferewith a wide variety of host cell processes, only a minority ofthese effectors have been functionally characterized (7, 18, 21,30, 40, 44, 48, 49, 54, 56, 61, 72, 73).The genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strains\u2014Philadelphia, Lens, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy\u2014have been re-ported to encode four eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinases(8, 15, 16, 26). Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of proteinsat serine/threonine/tyrosine residues represents a powerfulregulatory mechanism of cellular activity. Indeed, intensiveresearch has revealed that eukaryotes contain numerous inter-connected signal transduction networks in which protein phos-phorylation plays a dominant role. For many years, however,phosphorylation at serine/threonine/tyrosine has been consid-ered a new addition to the cell\u2019s regulatory arsenal and be-lieved to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Due in large part togenomic sequencing programs, some \u201cclassical\u201d serine/threo-nine/tyrosine protein kinases have been identified in severalbacterial genomes, but the function of most of them remainsunknown (13, 19). Interestingly, some of these enzymes havebeen recently described to play a critical role in virulence ofseveral pathogenic bacteria: PknG of Mycobacterium tubercu-losis (71), YpkA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (4), and SteC ofSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (59) are translocatedinto the host cell cytoplasm to modulate eukaryotic signaltransduction to the bacteria advantage and thus contribute tovirulence. Moreover, StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae is aglobal regulator of gene expression that positively controlsvirulence for lung infection and bloodstream invasion (20, 66),SP-STK of Streptococcus pyogenes has been reported to have* Corresponding author.

We report that the five putativeprotein kinases identified by in silico analysis of the L. pneu-mophila genomes are functional in terms of phosphorylation;actually, they can autophosphorylate and undergo in vitrophosphorylation of classical eukaryotic protein kinase sub-strates. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the protein kinaseLegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of Legionella towardamoebae. More precisely, we observed that the legK2 mutant isimpaired in ER recruitment and intracellular replication. SinceLegK2 is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm during in-fection, we assume that this protein kinase would interfere withhost cell signal transduction pathways to subvert host cell de-fenses to the bacteria benefit, thus resulting in an effectiveinfectious cycle and virulence.MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth of bacteria and phagocytes. The bacterial strains and plasmids used inthe present study are summarized in Table 1.L. pneumophila strains were grown at 30\u00b0C either on buffered charcoal yeastextract (BCYE) agar or in BYE liquid medium; each medium was supplementedwith kanamycin at 10 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 or chloramphenicol at 5 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 when appropri-ate. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium supplementedwith ampicillin at 100 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1, kanamycin at 20 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1, or chloramphenicol at5 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1. E. coli XL1-Blue was used to maintain plasmids and strain E. coliBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) was used for recombinant protein overproduction.Axenic Acanthamoeba castellanii cells were grown on PYG medium (proteose-yeast extract-glucose medium) at 30\u00b0C and split once a week. Dictyosteliumdiscoideum expressing calnexin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (DBS0236184)was obtained from the Dicty Stock Center (depositor A. Mu\u0308ller-Taubenberger[55]). D. discoideum cells were axenically grown in HL5 medium at 22\u00b0C, sup-plemented with G418 at 20 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 when necessary.J774A.1 macrophages were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.General DNA techniques. The oligonucleotides used in the present study areshown in Table 2.Standard techniques were used for nucleic acid cloning and restriction analy-sis. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Fermentas(Saint Re\u0301my-les-Chevreuses, France). Plasmid DNA from E. coli was preparedby rapid alkaline lysis (31). PCR amplifications were carried out with Phusionpolymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).Purification of DNA fragments from agarose gels for subcloning was carried outwith a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).Expression and purification of recombinant proteins. DNA fragments corre-sponding to the coding sequences of legK1 (lpl1545), legK2 (lpl2066), legK3(lpl2481), legK4 (lpl0262), and legK5 (lpl2476) were PCR amplified using genomicDNA of L. pneumophila Lens as the template and the following oligonucleotidepairs: for legK1, 1/2; for legK2, 3/4; for legK3, 5/6; for legK4, 7/8; and for legK5,9/10. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI or withSacI and PstI for legK5 and then inserted into PGEX-6P-3 for legK1, legK2, andlegK3 or pQE30 for legK4 and legK5. The resulting plasmids\u2014pGEX-legK1,pGEX-legK2, pGEX-legK3, pQE30-legK4, and pQE30-legK5\u2014were introducedinto E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL). Transformants were grown at37\u00b0C until cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.7. Geneexpressions were induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyrano-side) for 4 h at 20\u00b0C, and cell lysates were prepared by using a French pressurecell (SLM, Urbana, IL). GST and 6His recombinant proteins were purified undernative conditions by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads(GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) and a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), respectively,according to the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. The purity of the elutedprotein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were deter-mined by using a protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France).In vitro phosphorylation assay. In vitro phosphorylation of about 2 \ufffdg ofpurified recombinant protein was performed for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in 20 \ufffdl of abuffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,10 \ufffdM ATP, and 5 \ufffdCi of [\ufffd-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). Insome assays, MgCl2 was replaced with MnCl2. In eukaryotic substrate phosphor-ylation assays, 1 \ufffdg of myelin basic protein (MBP) was added. In each case, thereaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2\ufffd Laemmli loadingbuffer (41).TEM translocation assays. J774A.1 cells grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10%fetal calf serum were seeded in a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate at 105 cells perwell 24 h prior to infection. L. pneumophila strains carrying the various TEM\ufffd-lactamase fusions were grown on BCYE plates containing chloramphenicol.Single colonies were then streaked onto BCYE plates containing chloramphen-icol and 0.5 mM IPTG and grown for 24 h to induce production of the hybridproteins. Then, 10 \ufffdl of bacteria resuspended in RPMI at 5 \ufffd 108 cells ml\ufffd1 wasused to infect J774A.1 cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] \ufffd 50). After cen-trifugation (600 \ufffd g, 10 min) to initiate bacterium-cell contact, the plate wasshifted to 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation for 1 h with CO2 exchange. Cell mono-layers were loaded with the fluorescent substrate by adding 20 \ufffdl of 6\ufffdCCF4/AM solution (LiveBLAzer-FRET B/G loading kit; Invitrogen, Cergy Pon-toise, France) containing 15 mM Probenecid (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier,France). The cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature.Fluorescence was quantified on a Victor microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer) withexcitation at 405 nm (10-nm band-pass), and emission was detected via 460 nm(40-nm band-pass, blue fluorescence) and 530 nm (30-nm band-pass, greenfluorescence) filters. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy usingan inverted microscope equipped with the \ufffd-lactamase ratiometric filter set(Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) (17).Gene inactivation in L. pneumophila. To obtain L. pneumophila Lens mutantsdefective for legK genes, a homologous recombination strategy was chosen aspreviously described (23). The 400-bp upstream and downstream regions of thegene of interest were amplified by PCR, digested by NotI and SalI, and thencloned into pAV695. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pKD13(with the primers 11 and 12), digested by SalI, and cloned inside the encodingsequence of each legK gene in pAV695. The resulting construct was introducedinto L. pneumophila for chromosomal recombination.Construction of a kinase-dead LegK2-producing strain. In order to obtain thecatalytic mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M) defective in phosphate do-nor ATP binding, substitution in the legK2 gene was performed with aQuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primers 40 and41 listed in Table 2, and the pXDC50 derivative vector in which legK2 is clonedunder its own promoter, namely, plegK2 plasmid, as a template (Table 1). Thefinal construct was used to transform the L. pneumophila \ufffdlegK2 mutant strain.Pigment production. For quantifying pigment accumulation, 1-ml portions of thesamples, obtained from 5-day-old BYE cultures grown at 30\u00b0C, were centrifuged at16,000 \ufffd g for 10 min, and the OD550 of the supernatants was measured (65).Cytotoxicity to A. castellanii. For measurement of the number of viable A.castellanii cells remaining after infection, the monolayers were treated with 10%Alamar blue (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). At the time point indicated, themonolayers were washed four times with protease-yeast extract (PY), and then 100\ufffdl of PY containing 10% (vol/vol) of Alamar blue was added to each well. After anovernight incubation, the OD570 values were determined. The relative degree of amoebamortality was expressed as the ratio of the OD value of infected monolayer to that ofuninfected one, calculated as [1 \ufffd (mean ODinfected/mean ODuninfected)] \ufffd 100.Measurement of released extracellular bacteria. L. pneumophila was grown onBCYE agar for 5 days at 30\u00b0C prior to infection. A. castellanii cells were seededin multiwell plates to a final concentration of 5 \ufffd 105 cells ml\ufffd1. After adhesion,the cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with L. pneumophila. The plates werecentrifuged at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min, followed by incubation for 1 h at 30\u00b0C.Monolayers were then washed four times with PY to remove extracellular bac-teria. The time at the end of the final wash was the initial time point. After 24 h,extracellular bacteria were numbered by plating them on BCYE.Intracellular growth in A. castellanii. Intracellular growth was monitored aspreviously described (36). L. pneumophila cells harboring a fluorescent mCherryprotein-producing plasmid were grown on BCYE agar containing 0.5 mM IPTGand chloramphenicol for 5 days at 30\u00b0C. A. castellanii cells were grown asadherent cells in 96-well microplates (105 cells/well) and then infected with 106fluorescent legionellae (MOI \ufffd 10). Infection was synchronized by spinning thebacteria at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min. Intracellular growth was automatically monitoredby measuring the fluorescence of mCherry at an excitation of 587 nm and anemission of 610 nm in a Xenius Safas plate reader every hour for 66 h (Safas,Monaco). Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (unin-fected cells).Bacteria uptake assay by trypan blue quenching. L. pneumophila phagocytosiswas measured by trypan blue quenching as previously described (10). Briefly,VOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1937bacteria from overnight cultures in BYE were labeled with 5,6-carboxyfluores-cein succinimidyl ester. A. castellanii cells were grown as adherent cells in 96-wellmicroplates (5 \ufffd 105 cells/well) and then infected with 107 fluorescent legionellae(MOI \ufffd 20). After centrifugation (880 \ufffd g for 10 min) to initiate cell-bacteriumcontact, the plate was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. The medium was thenreplaced by 50 \ufffdl per well of trypan blue solution to quench the fluorescence ofnoninternalized bacteria. After 1 min of incubation, the fluorescence of inter-nalized bacteria was measured on a Xenius Safas plate reader (Safas, Monaco)with an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm.Recruitment of the ER to LCV in D. discoideum. D. discoideum cells producingcalnexin-GFP were used to analyze by fluorescence microscopy the recruitmentof ER to Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) that harbor mCherry-labeled L.TABLE 1.

D. discoideum cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in6-well plates at 5 \ufffd 106 per well in HL5 and allowed to adhere overnight.Monolayers were infected at an MOI of 100 with bacteria grown for 5 days at30\u00b0C. The plates were spun at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min, followed by incubation at 25\u00b0C.The monolayers were then washed two times with 2 ml of SorC buffer (2 mMNa2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM CaCl2; pH 6.0) and fixed with 3.7% para-formaldehyde (30 min, 4\u00b0C). Coverslips were examined with an inverted confocalmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss, Thornwood, NJ) equipped with a \ufffd63 phase-contrast objective lens (Plan Neofluar [Zeiss]; aperture, 1.4, oil).Localization of LegK2 within the host cell. The \ufffdlegK2 mutant strain wascotransformed with p3041 and pEP73 plasmids (Table 1), which encode mCherryand the GFP-LegK2 hybrid protein, respectively. The obtained strain was used toinfect D. discoideum DH1 at an MOI of 100 for 1 h. Fluorescent GFP-LegK2protein and mCherry-labeled bacteria were observed with an inverted confocalmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss) equipped with a \ufffd63 phase-contrast objec-tive (Plan Neofluar). Alternatively, D. discoideum DH1 harboring pEP46 vector(Table 1), which ectopically express legK2(K112M)-c-myc, were seeded ontocoverslips and infected with mCherry-labeled L. pneumophila legK2 and dotAmutant strains or E. coli XL1-Blue as described above. After 1 h of infection, thecells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with phosphate-buffered salinesupplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were thenstained with \r-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (1/5,000, clone 9E10; Sigma) for 1 hand visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (MolecularProbes, Eugene, OR) at a 1/300 dilution for 30 min. Microscopic observations ofmCherry-labeled bacteria and LegK2 protein were performed with an invertedconfocal microscope (Axiovert 200M).Statistical analysis. The results were statistically analyzed by using a Studentt test. The t test results obtained correspond to the comparison between legKmutants with the parental strain values in the same conditions.RESULTSL. pneumophila Lens genome encodes five putative proteinkinases.

Alignment with several prokaryotic andeukaryotic protein kinases revealed residues that are highlyconserved in the Hanks subdomains characterizing the eu-karyote-like protein kinase family (28). These include the gly-cine-rich loop and the invariant lysine in subdomains I and II,which are essential for binding and correct orientation of thephosphate donor ATP (Fig. 1A). Consensus sequences in sub-domains VI, VII, and VIII, involved in phosphotransfer andsubstrate recognition are also conserved in LegK1, LegK3, andLegK4; LegK2 and LegK5 lack subdomain VIII (Fig. 1A).Further primary sequence analysis predicted an EF-hand do-main in LegK5, which is known to be involved in calciumbinding (53). Moreover, hydropathy profiles suggest a trans-membrane helix between amino acids 478 and 498 of LegK1,which is consistent with a membrane location of LegK1,whereas LegK2 to LegK5 are likely cytoplasmic (Table 3).The protein kinases encoding genes legK1 to legK5 are dis-tributed in various regions of the L. pneumophila Lens chro-TABLE 3.

Encoded proteins are named below.1940 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.mosome. Organization of the legK4 region is remarkable: legK4is located immediately upstream a gene (lpl0263) that encodesa protein with a high degree of similarity (39% identity) withthe C-terminal domain (from amino acid 323 to amino acid910) of LegK4. This genetic organization is conserved in thefive sequenced L. pneumophila strains and suggests a partialduplication of legK4 homologous genes. On the other hand,whereas genes legK1 to legK4 are conserved in all L. pneumo-phila sequenced strains, legK5 is specific of strain Lens. It islocated in a chromosomal region containing four genes thatare absent in Philadelphia, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy genomes(Fig. 1B). Compared to the average genomic GC content of38.4% for Lens strain (8), legK5 and its neighboring genes havea significantly lower GC content of 35% (legK5), 34%(lpl2477), and 36% (lpl2478). Moreover, lpl2478 gene encodesa putative transposase, and the region is flanked by two ho-mologous genes, namely, lpl2475 and lpl2479 (Fig. 1B). Theseobservations suggest that the legK5 chromosomal region hasbeen acquired in Lens genome by a small insertion event as-sociated with horizontal transfer.LegK2 to LegK5 display autokinase and protein kinase ac-tivities. To determine whether LegK1 to LegK5 are functionalprotein kinases, each protein was overproduced and purified asa recombinant protein fused to either six-histidine or glutathi-one S-transferase tags. The legK4 and legK5 genes were PCRamplified using genomic DNA of L. pneumophila strain Lensand cloned into the expression vector pQE30 to allow thesynthesis of N-terminal six-histidine-tagged proteins. The re-combinant proteins, with respective molecular masses of 110and 52 kDa, were overproduced in the E. coli strainBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) and highly enriched by a single-step chromatography on Ni-NTA matrix (Fig. 2A). The full-length legK2 and legK3 genes were synthesized by PCR ampli-fication and cloned into pGEX-6P-3 plasmid to produce GSTN-terminal fused proteins. The truncated legK1 gene (nucleo-tides 4 to 1431) lacking the DNA fragment encoding the pu-tative transmembrane helix was cloned into the same expres-sion vector. The GST-tagged recombinant LegK1 (87 kDa),LegK2 (88 kDa), and LegK3 (79 kDa) proteins were purifiedto partial homogeneity from the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix(Fig. 2A).The purified tagged LegK1-LegK5 proteins were then sep-arately assayed for autokinase activity. Each recombinant pro-tein was incubated with the phosphate donor [\ufffd-32P]ATP andthen separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiogra-phy (Fig. 2B). Except for GST-LegK1, all Legionella recombi-nant kinases were significantly radiolabeled and thus undergoautophosphorylation. Their autokinase activities are differentlydependent of magnesium or manganese ions. Although LegK4used these ions as cofactor with the same efficiency, LegK2 andLegK5 autophosphorylated more efficiently in the presence ofmanganese; conversely, the radiolabeling of LegK3 was higherin the presence of magnesium (Fig. 2B).The recombinant LegK1 to LegK5 proteins were furthercharacterized by studying their ability to phosphorylate pro-teins. They were assayed for in vitro phosphorylation of thegeneral eukaryotic protein kinase substrate, myelin basic pro-tein (MBP), in the presence of [\ufffd-32P]ATP. Except for GST-LegK1, a radiolabeled signal corresponding to the expectedFIG. 2.

(C) Protein kinase activities of LegK proteins. The eu-karyotic substrate myelin basic protein (MBP) was incubated with eachLegK recombinant protein in the presence of [\ufffd-32P]ATP. Phosphopro-teins were visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE separation.VOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 194118-kDa molecular mass of MBP was detected, thus demon-strating that LegK2, LegK3, LegK4, and LegK5 are able tophosphorylate protein substrates such as MBP (Fig. 2C).LegK1 to LegK4 proteins are effectors of the Dot/Icm T4SS.Most of the eukaryote-like proteins encoded by L. pneumo-phila genome are translocated into the host cell cytoplasm,where they may interfere with host cell functions, thus allowingbacterial evasion of the endosomal pathway (17). AlthoughLegK1, LegK2, and LegK3 have been recently identified asDot/Icm T4SS effectors (17, 25, 68), the translocation of LegK4and LegK5 has not been documented yet. In order to deter-mine whether these protein kinases are translocated during theinfectious cycle, the TEM-1 reporter system (\ufffd-lactamase) wasused (17). Briefly, the TEM-1 was fused to the N-terminal ofLegK4 and LegK5, and L. pneumophila strains efficiently ex-pressing these fusions (Fig. 3A) were used to infect J774 mac-rophages. Host cells were then loaded with CCF4, which emitsgreen fluorescence (520 nm) due to fluorescence resonanceenergy transfer between the two fluorophores of this substratewhen excited at 409 nm (Fig. 3B, uninfected). When the hybridprotein was translocated, as expected for the fusion with theknown Dot/Icm effector VipA, it cleaved the \ufffd-lactam ring ofCCF4, thus resulting in fluorescence changing from green toblue (447 nm), when excited at the same wavelength (Fig. 3B,TEM-VipA). Conversely, when TEM-1 was fused to thehousekeeping protein enoyl-acyl coenzyme A reductase FabI,cells still developed green fluorescence (Fig. 3B, TEM-FabI).Emission of blue fluorescence was observed when cells wereinfected with wild-type L. pneumophila strains expressing theTEM-LegK4 fusion protein, while green fluorescence was stillemitted when cells were infected with bacteria containingTEM-LegK5 fusion. These analyses establish that LegK4, butnot LegK5, is translocated into host macrophages during L.pneumophila infection. When a dotA mutant L. pneumophilastrain producing TEM-LegK4 infected macrophages, nochange in fluorescence was observed [Fig. 3B, \ufffddotA(TEM-LegK4)]. This result demonstrates that translocation of theLegK4 protein kinase is Dot/Icm T4SS dependent.Inactivation of legK1 to legK5 genes has no effect on mediumgrowth neither intracellular life cycle switch of Legionella. Toidentify the physiological role of Legionella protein kinases,each legK gene was separately inactivated, as described in Ma-terials and Methods. Genes were partially deleted and re-placed by a unique insertion of a kanamycin cassette(legK::kan), verified by PCR and Southern hybridization (datanot shown). The five isogenic mutants displayed similar growthcharacteristics in liquid medium compared to the parentalstrain L. pneumophila Lens, and analysis of mutant cell mor-phologies by light microscopy did not reveal any major differ-ences (data not shown).Successful infection of host cells is strictly linked to a precisetiming of the life cycle of Legionella, namely, to the switch fromthe replicative to transmissive bacteria. Intracellular acquiredtransmissive traits can be mimicked by stationary mediumgrowth phase (52). To check whether the LegK protein kinasesare involved in the regulatory processes that control the intra-cellular life cycle of Legionella, each legK mutant was assayedfor the characteristic trait of the postexponential growth phase,pigment production (65). The five legK mutants accumulatedpigment during growth, as did the wild-type strain (data notshown).LegK2 protein kinase activity plays a key role in the viru-lence of Legionella toward amoeba. In order to assess the vir-ulence of each legK mutant strain, Acanthamoeba castellaniiamoebae were infected at an MOI of 10 with the wild-type L.pneumophila Lens or the isogenic legK::kan mutants, and theviability of amoeba cells present in infected monolayers at 48 hpostinfection was quantified by using the Alamar blue dye. Thecytotoxicity of the legK2 mutant strain toward amoeba, esti-mated at 30%, was significantly lower (P \ufffd 0.01) than the valueof 90% measured for the parental strain. Conversely, legK1,legK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants displayed similar cytotoxicitytoward amoebae compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 4A).To further evaluate the virulence of each Legionella strain,extracellular released bacteria were numbered after one infec-tious cycle, i.e., at 24 h postinfection. Compared to the parentalstrain, 1.5-log fewer bacteria of the mutant strain legK2 (P \ufffd0.04) were released from A. castellanii at 24 h postinfection. InFIG. 3. Dot/Icm-dependent translocation of LegK4 into J774 cells.(A) Western blot analysis of TEM fusion expression detected with an\r-TEM antibody. (B) J774 cells were infected with L. pneumophilawild-type or dotA mutant strains harboring TEM-FabI, TEM-VipA,TEM-LegK4, and TEM-LegK5 expression plasmids at an MOI of 50.Infected cells were loaded with CCF4/AM, and translocation was de-termined by a comparison of cleaved to uncleaved CCF4 that givesblue and green fluorescence, respectively. Images were obtained byusing epifluorescence microscopy on individual assay wells.1942 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.FIG. 4. Role of LegK proteins in virulence toward A. castellanii. (A) Cytotoxicity of L. pneumophila. Cells were infected at an MOI of 10. Theviability of amoeba cells present in infected monolayers at 48 h postinfection was quantified by using the Alamar blue dye. These data arerepresentative of two independent experiments done in triplicate. (B) Release of bacteria from amoebae infected with L. pneumophila. After 24 hof infection, the number of extracellular bacteria was evaluated by the standard plate count assay. The results are expressed in CFU ml\ufffd1 and arerepresentative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars represent the standard deviations. (C) Intracellular growth ofL. pneumophila in amoebae. Amoebae were infected at an MOI of 10 by L. pneumophila cells expressing the mCherry gene on a plasmid. Bacteriamultiplication was automatically monitored by measuring the fluorescence of mCherry at an excitation of 587 nm and an emission of 610 nm every2 h for 66 h. Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (uninfected cells).VOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1943contrast, extracellular bacteria quantified for the legK1, legK3,legK4, and legK5 mutants were similar to the wild-type strain(Fig. 4B).To check whether the legK2 phenotype is related to a defectof bacteria egress or intracellular multiplication, the Lensstrain or its legK mutant derivatives expressing the fluorescentmCherry protein on a plasmid were used to infect amoebas atan MOI of 10. Bacterial intracellular growth was monitored byfluorescence measurement during a 66 h-time course (Fig. 4C).As expected, wild-type L. pneumophila started efficient intra-cellular growth (an \ufffd40-fold increase in fluorescence) from15 h postinfection, whereas the T4SS dotA mutant failed toreplicate. The legK1, legK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants showedintracellular multiplication from the same time, with the sameor lightly reduced growth rates compared to Lens strain. Onthe contrary, legK2 mutant was delayed for intracellular mul-tiplication since it started replicating 48 h after infection. Afterthat, its growth rate was not significantly different (P \ufffd 0.02)from that measured for the wild-type strain.To confirm the link between legK2 deletion and the virulencedefect observed, complementation experiments were carriedout. Complementation of the legK2 mutant by introducing a\ufffdmobA RSF1010 derivative vector expressing the intact legK2gene restored the cytotoxicity and the released extracellularbacteria of the parental strain (Fig. 5A and B). Complemen-tation assays of the legK2 intracellular multiplication defectwere performed by introducing the same vector, producingboth the intact LegK2 and the fluorescent mCherry proteins.The intracellular replication kinetics observed for the comple-mented legK2 strain was similar to that observed for the Lensstrain (Fig. 5C).To determine whether the protein kinase activity of LegK2is critical for Legionella intracellular multiplication, a substitu-tion kinase-dead mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M)defective in phosphate donor ATP binding, was generated bysite-directed mutagenesis of the legK2 gene cloned on theRSF1010 derivative vector. This construct, which stably pro-duces the same level of kinase-dead LegK2 compared to thewild-type protein (as checked by Western blotting experiments[data not shown]), was used to complement the \ufffdlegK2 mutantdefects in cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A), extracellular bacteria release(Fig. 5B), and intracellular multiplication (Fig. 5C). The sub-stitution legK2 mutant is not able to complement the defects ofthe deletion legK2 mutant strain, suggesting that the proteinkinase activity of LegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of L.pneumophila.Thus, L. pneumophila encodes five functional protein ki-nases that play a variable role in bacterial virulence towardamoebae: a nondetectable role for LegK1, LegK3, LegK4, andLegK5, but a key role for LegK2. These results suggest thatLegionella protein kinases are differentially expressed duringthe Legionella infectious cycle or that they are not functionallyequal, and they would control various host or bacterial func-tions. To answer this question, legK gene expression during theexponential and stationary bacterial growth phases, whichmimic the replicative and transmissive bacterial forms, respec-tively, was established by performing real-time quantitativePCR experiments. All the five legK genes were expressed inlaboratory growth conditions, and expression patterns dis-played a similar slight downregulation of legK1, legK2, legK3,and legK4 genes when bacteria entered the postexponentialgrowth phase (data not shown). Moreover, the legK2 virulencedefect was assayed for complementation by vectors expressinglegK1, legK3, legK4, or legK5 under the control of the endogenicpromoter of the legK2 gene. None of these legK genes express-ing plasmids can reverse the virulence phenotype of legK2mutant, as observed with the cytotoxicity of the correspondingstrains (Fig. 5A), the extracellular bacteria numeration (Fig.5B), and the intracellular replication (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly,expression of these genes even led to an additional loss ofvirulence. To check whether this observation is restricted to alegK2 genetic background, the same legK genes expressing vec-tors were transformed into the wild-type strain Lens. Expres-sion of each legK gene on this plasmid resulted in a loss ofvirulence (data not shown). Further experiments are under wayto mechanistically examine this result, but we assume that thiseffect most likely results from nonspecific factors, such as theelevated expression level of legK genes, which may interferewith the translocation of other T4SS substrates. Taken to-gether, these data demonstrate that LegK2 plays a unique rolein the virulence of L. pneumophila and is not functionallyredundant with the four tested Legionella protein kinases.LegK2 protein kinase activity is required for ER recruit-ment on the LCV. To further characterize the virulence defectof legK2 mutant strain, the infectious cycle step altered wasinvestigated. Intracellular survival at the onset of the A. cas-tellanii infection was assessed by counting the viable intracel-lular bacteria at 1 h 20 min, 2 h, and 4 h postinfection. Thelevel of viable intracellular legK2 cells in amoebae correspondsto \ufffd10% of the parental strain (P \ufffd 0.02), as early as 1 h 20postinfection (Fig. 6A). This result points out the major role ofthe protein kinase LegK2 in the early steps of the infectiouscycle of L. pneumophila, namely, in bacterial uptake or inbacterial intracellular survival.Bacteria uptake in amoebae was measured by trypan bluequenching of fluorescein-labeled L. pneumophila. Wild-typestrain or legK2 derivative were fluorescein-labeled and used toinfect A. castellanii. After contact, trypan blue was added toquench the fluorescence of noninternalized bacteria. Mea-sured fluorescence is representative of bacterial uptake, asdemonstrated by the effect of the actin polymerization inhibi-tor, cytochalasin D (Fig. 6B). The fluorescence of internalizedlegK2 mutant was similar to that measured for the wild-typestrain (Fig. 6B), thus suggesting that LegK2 is not required forbacterial uptake but is more likely required for subsequentinfectious cycle steps, namely, host cell vesicular traffickingcontrol.The unique intracellular fate of L. pneumophila involves ERrecruitment to the LCV to evade the endocytic pathway andreside in a specialized vacuole, allowing intracellular replica-tion. Recruitment of the ER by L. pneumophila was observedin the model amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum expressing thespecific marker of ER, namely, calnexin fused to the GFP.Amoebae were infected at an MOI of 100 with wild-type orlegK2 mutant strains that express the red fluorescent protein(mCherry), and calnexin-positive LCVs were visually scored byconfocal microscopy at 1 and 4 h postinfection. In D. discoi-deum infected with the parental Legionella strain Lens, ca. 70%of the LCVs stained positive for calnexin-GFP as early as 1 hafter infection. On the contrary, only 12 and 13% (P \ufffd 0.01) of1944 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.the legK2 mutant containing vacuoles were positive for cal-nexin at 1 and 4 h postinfection, respectively. The legK2 ERrecruitment defect is partially complemented by legK2-express-ing RSF1010 derivative vector, since 49 and 51% (P\ufffd 0.01) ofthe legK2(plegK2) strain containing vacuoles were labeled bycalnexin at 1 and 4 h postinfection, respectively. The incom-plete complementation of the mutant could result from anelevated level of legK2 gene expression on the plasmid, whichFIG. 5.

LegK2 is required for ER recruitment on LCV. (A) Uptake and survival ability of legK2 mutant strain. A. castellanii cells were infectedat an MOI of 10 with wild-type, dotA mutant, and legK2 mutant strains. After different periods of contact with L. pneumophila, monolayers weretreated for 1 h with gentamicin to kill adherent bacteria and disrupted with 0.04% Triton X-100. Viable intracellular bacteria were diluted andplated onto BCYE agar plates for colony enumeration. The results are expressed as a relative value (%) compared to a control invasion experimentwith the wild-type strain. These data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate; error bars represent the standarddeviations. (B) Bacterial uptake assay. A. castellanii cells were infected with fluorescein-labeled Legionella at an MOI of 20, in the presence ofcytochalasin D when indicated ( CytoD). After 30 min of incubation, the medium was replaced by trypan blue solution to quench the fluorescenceof noninternalized bacteria. The fluorescence of internalized bacteria was measured using an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm.Fluorescence data were corrected for differences in labeling efficiency between the tested strains. Labeling efficiencies between strains varied byca. 10%. (C) Recruitment of calnexin-GFP. Fifty Legionella containing vacuoles were scored from each sample by confocal laser scanningmicrographs of calnexin-GFP-labeled D. discoideum AX3 infected at an MOI of 100 with mCherry-labeled L. pneumophila. Calnexin-positivevacuoles were numbered for amoeba cells infected by the wild-type L. pneumophila Lens strain, its derivative dotA and legK2 mutant strains, andthe complemented legK2(plegK2) and legK2(plegK2K112M) mutant strains. The data are representative of three independent experiments; each errorbar represents the standard deviation.

IMMUN.may interfere with the translocation of other T4SS substratesrequired for ER recruitment. Together, these results indicatethat in the absence of LegK2, ER is recruited to LCVs lessefficiently. To identify whether the protein kinase activity ofLegK2 is involved in ER recruitment, complementation assaysof the deleted legK2 mutant defect were performed with thesubstitution mutant legK2(K112M)-expressing vector. About11% of the legK2(plegK2K112M) mutant-containing vacuoleswere stained with the ER marker calnexin at 1 and 4 h postin-fection, which is very similar to that observed for the legK2mutant (Fig. 6C). The lack of complementation by the legK2catalytic mutant points out the major role of LegK2 proteinkinase activity in ER recruitment on the LCV.To determine whether LegK2 anchors to the phagosomalmembrane to recruit ER on the LCV, cellular localization ofLegK2 during infection was investigated. Legionella cells pro-ducing the hybrid protein GFP-LegK2 were used to infectamoeba cells, and cellular localization of the hybrid proteinwas observed by confocal microscopy. Despite a good level ofgfp-legK2 expression in bacteria, we could not detect GFP-LegK2 protein either in the host cell cytoplasm or on the LCV,probably due to a low level of translocation into host cells (datanot shown). To circumvent this difficulty, a strain of theamoeba D. discoideum that ectopically produces the C-termi-nal c-Myc-tagged LegK2(K112M) protein was constructed. Ec-topic expression of the catalytic legK2 mutant, rather than thewild-type legK2 strain, was preferred to avoid possible aspecificeffects of an active protein kinase overproduction on theamoeba physiology and to facilitate stable binding of LegK2to its putative host cell interactants (35, 58), which may becrucial for LegK2 localization. Immunofluorescence obser-vations suggested a diffused host cell cytoplasm localizationof LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc (Fig. 6D). To determine whetherthe localization of LegK2(K112M) could be dependent onother T4SS effectors, localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Mycwas investigated during infection of amoebae by a \ufffdlegK2strain of L. pneumophila. Interestingly, infection triggeredthe localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc into the plasmamembrane (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, the same observation wasmade by incubating amoebae with Escherichia coli, suggest-ing that localization of LegK2(K112M) to the plasma mem-brane may be dependent on bacterial phagocytosis ratherthan on T4SS effector translocation and efficient Legionellainfection (Fig. 6D). Thus, when LegK2 is ectopically over-produced in amoebae, it is associated with the plasma mem-brane but not with the phagosomal membrane.DISCUSSIONThe genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strainsare characterized by an unusual abundance of eucaryote-likeproteins encoding genes; among them four protein kinasesencoding genes have been identified (8). Our extensive in silicoanalysis of the epidemic strain Lens genome identified onemore protein kinase encoding gene, namely, legK5 gene. It isnoteworthy that legK5 is specific to this strain. Interestingly, theLegK5 protein is homologous (50.99% identity) to a protein(UniprotKB entry number C6N1E1) from the strictly intracel-lular amoebal pathogen Legionella drancourtii (42). Moreover,lpl2477, located immediately downstream legK5, encodes aprotein that displays 27% identity with an uncharacterizedprotein (UniProtKB entry number Q1RJU6) from Rickettsiabelii, another intracellular bacteria that infects amoebae. Fi-nally, the GC content of the legK5 genomic region and theoccurrence of a transposase-encoding gene strongly suggestthat legK5 has been acquired by a small insertion event asso-ciated with horizontal transfer during co-evolution with otherbacteria in amoebae; it might represent a new instance ofgenomic recombination in amoebae, which have been consid-ered a gene melting pot for evolution in a recent review (50).Multiple sequence comparisons of the kinase domains ofLegK1 to LegK5 with eukaryotic and procaryotic protein ki-nase domains revealed that LegK1 and LegK3 cluster in thegroup of eukaryotic protein kinases, close to protein kinasesfrom protozoa (data not shown), as previously reported (8, 46).This observation raises the possibility of their initial acquisitionby L. pneumophila from the distant eukaryotic organisms thatare natural hosts for Legionella. In contrast, LegK2, LegK4,and LegK5 are not closely similar to eukaryotic protein kinasesor prokaryotic enzymes. It is noteworthy that protein kinaseshave been identified in intracellular bacteria such as Mycobac-terium tuberculosis (1, 9) and nonpathogenic species such asMyxococcus xanthus and Anabaena cyanobacteria (47, 57, 74).The occurrence of protein kinase-encoding genes in free non-pathogenic bacterial species and in-depth analysis of GC contentof various protein kinase encoding genes led researchers previ-ously to conclude that bacterial protein kinases (\u201ceukaryote-like\u201d)existed before the divergence between eukaryotes and pro-karyotes during evolution (27). Thus, even though the presence ofhorizontally acquired eukaryotic genes in amoeba pathogens suchas L. pneumophila appears increasingly evident, the precise originof protein kinase-encoding genes in L. pneumophila genomes hasnot been completely deciphered.The eukaryotic kinase family is characterized by 11 con-served sequences, described as the Hanks subdomains, whichare involved in ATP binding, and in phosphorylation reaction.LegK2 and LegK5 lack the Hanks subdomain VIII required forsubstrate recognition and phosphotransfer. However, bothLegK2 and LegK5 are able to autophosphorylate and phos-phorylate the eukaryotic protein kinase substrate myelin basicprotein (MBP). More than 600 bacterial protein kinases havebeen identified through genome sequencing projects and ho-mology-based comparisons with eukaryotic kinases and, lessfrequently, through direct experimental evidence (38, 39).Generally, protein kinases from bacteria conserve the nucleo-tide binding region (subdomains I to III) and the core catalyticdomain (subdomain VII known as Brenner\u2019s motif H-X-D-X4-N [6]), but some of them display less homology as con-served enzymatic activity; for instance, SteC, which is requiredfor host cell actin remodeling by Salmonella, is a functionalprotein kinase that exhibits only subdomains I to III involved inATP binding (59). Moreover, although YihE from E. coliclearly possesses protein kinase activity, sequence analysis re-veals little similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases, whereastridimensional structure analysis reveals a kinase-like fold sim-ilar to that of choline kinase and aminoglycoside phospho-transferase (75). Likewise but to a lesser extent, LegK2 andLegK5 are functional in terms of phosphorylation even thoughthey do not display all of the consensus domains of the eukary-otic protein kinase family. In contrast, LegK1 was not in vitroVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1947labeled by autophosphorylation and could not phosphorylatethe MBP in standard in vitro assay conditions. It can be hy-pothesized that LegK1 must be activated to be functional.Indeed, it was previously shown that YpkA from Y. pestis isproduced as an inactive protein kinase. This essential virulencefactor is then translocated by a T3SS into the host cell, whereit is activated by the host cell actin (33). On the other hand, wecan assume that LegK1 cannot use the MBP as substrate butcould phosphorylate other specific protein substrates. Indeed,it has been recently reported that LegK1 can specifically phos-phorylate in vitro the eukaryotic I\ufffdB\r protein but not MBP incells, thus activating the NF-\ufffdB pathway (25).The bacterial protein kinases LegK1 to LegK4 are translo-cated into the host cell cytoplasm by the Dot/Icm T4SS duringinfection of L. pneumophila. Conversely, LegK5 appeared notto be translocated. It is noteworthy that another intracellularpathogen, M. tuberculosis, encodes 11 different protein kinases,among them one that is translocated into the host cell tosubvert the host cell defenses (70, 71), while others are tailoredfor bacterial signal transduction pathways (1, 51). Likewise,LegK5 may be involved in bacterial transduction signalingpathways that control Legionella metabolism rather than in thecontrol of host cell functions.Interestingly, inactivation and/or kinase-dead substitution ofthe legK2 gene resulted in a significant decrease in the viru-lence of L. pneumophila toward amoebae. It is noteworthy thatT4SS effectors mutants are usually not altered in Legionellavirulence, probably due to the high redundancy of these effec-tors genes (22). The legK2 mutant virulence defect is not com-plemented by other legK gene expression vectors, thus showinga unique and key role for the LegK2 protein kinase in thecontrol of the infectious cycle of L. pneumophila. Althoughthe four other LegK proteins did not interfere individually withthe overall ability of Legionella to replicate in the host, theymight modulate subtle pathways of Legionella infectivity and/orhave complementary or redundant cellular and functional tar-gets. Indeed, although LegK1 has been reported to activate theNF-\ufffdB pathway and likely plays an important role in modulat-ing macrophages defenses during L. pneumophila infection,deletion of the legK1 gene has no notable effects on its intra-cellular replication (25, 45).The legK2 mutant strain is defective for recruiting the ER tothe LCV, which results in delayed bacterial intracellular rep-lication. Remodeling its phagosome by the recruitment of ERis a characteristic trait of the unique intracellular fate of L.pneumophila to evade the endocytic pathway (11, 34). Inter-estingly, two other Dot/Icm substrates, namely, SidC and SidJ,which do not display any homology with protein kinases, havebeen recently shown to be involved in ER recruitment (43, 62).Mutation in sidJ results in a phenotype very similar to that ofthe legK2 mutation, i.e., a sidJ mutant is considerably delayedin both ER recruitment on the LCV and intracellular growth.Moreover, SidJ was not associated with the phagosomal mem-brane. These results led researchers to conclude that SidJmodulates as-yet-unknown host cellular pathways to controlthe trafficking or the retention of ER-derived vesicles to theLCV (43). It would be interesting to determine whether SidJand LegK2 function synergistically and target the same orparallel pathways. On the other hand, SidC is an L. pneumo-phila effector protein that anchors to the host cell lipid phos-phatidylinositol-4 phosphate and could act as a \u201ctethering do-main\u201d for ER vesicle recruitment to the LCV (62). Indeed, aswith sidJ and legK2 mutants, an LCV harboring the sidC mu-tant recruits ER less efficiently than does the wild type. How-ever, sidC mutant replicates at the same rate as the wild type,while localizing in calnexin-negative LCVs, thus indicating thatthe interaction with the ER might not be a prerequisite to forma L. pneumophila replication-permissive compartment. In asimilar manner, ralF and drrA mutants replicate normally de-spite an inability to recruit the host GTPase ER-Golgi regula-tors Rab1 and Arf1 to the LCV, respectively (49, 54). Thisindicates that L. pneumophila simultaneously targets multipleand yet unknown functionally redundant pathways to contrib-ute to the formation of replication-permissive LCVs, leading tothe absence of a phenotype when any single pathway is dis-rupted. If we consider that a kinase-dead legK2 mutant isaltered both in ER recruitment and in intracellular Legionellareplication, it can be proposed that the LegK2 protein kinaseplays a key role for modulating one or several of the host cellsignal transduction pathways that contribute to the formationof the LCV. Interestingly, this result highlights a new molec-ular mechanism, namely, protein phosphorylation, developedby L. pneumophila to subvert host cell defenses. The relation-ship between protein phosphorylation and virulence of L.pneumophila will be investigated further by characterizing thehost cell pathways controlled by LegK2. Indeed, decipheringthe individual contribution of each Legionella effector to theintracellular lifestyle of the bacteria remains a major and per-haps the principal challenge to understanding the molecularbasis of Legionella virulence.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by the PEPS program from the CentreNational de la Recherche Scientifique and the Universite\u0301 Lyon 1.
