Zhang).1 Hong-Xia Wang and Dong-Mei Zhang contributeda b s t r a c tShort, nonlethal ischemic episodes administered to hearts directly after ischemic events (ischemic post-conditioning, IPost) have an advantage over ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The endogenous cytochromeP450 2J3/11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (CYP2J3/11,12-EET) is upregulated by IPost, but not IPC, in therat heart. The CYP epoxygenase inhibitor N-methylsulphonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl) hexanamide(MS-PPOH) reduces the cardioprotective effects of IPost, but not IPC. We proposed that upregulation ofCYP2J3/11,12-EET during IPost induces cardioprotection by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and thatmultiple apoptotic signals, including changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mito-chondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, caspase-3levels, and levels of protective kinases such as Bcl-2 and Bax, are involved in the process. Neonatal ratcardiomyocytes underwent 3-h hypoxia followed by 2-, 5-, or 6-h reoxygenation (H/R) or three cyclesof 5-min reoxygenation followed by 5-min hypoxia before 90-min reoxygenation (HPost); or were trans-fected with pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 for 48 h before H/R; or were treated with MS-PPOH for 10 min beforeHPost. For HPost alone, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis to 68.4%(p < 0.05) of that with H/R. pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection significantly decreased MMP and inhibitedmPTP opening induced by H/R, reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, cleaved caspase-3 proteinexpression, and increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression. MS-PPOH abolished this effect. Therefore,upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost is involved in cardioprotection by inhibiting apoptosisvia a caspase-dependent pathway, and the apoptosis-suppressive effect may have important clinicalimplications during HPost.\ufffd 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.1. IntroductionCycles of brief reperfusion and ischemia performed immedi-ately at the onset of reperfusion following prolonged ischemiamarkedly limit reperfusion injury [1]. Zhao et al. named this car-dioprotective phenomenon \u2018\u2018ischemia postconditioning\u2019\u2019 (IPost),which is as powerful as ischemic preconditioning (IPC) [2,3]. IPosthas been demonstrated in isolated perfused hearts [4] and in manyin vivo models and species [5] such as dogs [2], rabbits [6], rats [4],pigs [7], and, recently, humans [8]. IPost has great advantages overIPC after myocardial infarction. For promising clinical applicationElsevier Ltd.athophysiology, Capital Med-g 100069, China. Tel.: +86 10equally to this work.of IPost, further investigations are necessary to characterize its sig-nal transduction pathway and identify the final end effector.Our previous work showed that the endogenous cytochromeP450 2J3/11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic (CYP2J3/11,12-EET) is upregu-lated by IPost, but not by IPC, in the rat heart. The CYP epoxygenaseinhibitor MS-PPOH reduces the cardioprotective effects of IPost,but not IPC [9]. Therefore, upregulation of the CYP2J3/EET systemduring IPost may be a novel signaling mechanism protectingagainst ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and may be distinct fromIPC. However, the precise mechanisms mediating the protective ef-fects of IPost by CYP2J3/EET remain unclear.Recently, IPost was suggested to attenuate lethal reperfusion in-jury by opening mitochondrial KATP channels and reactive oxygenspecies signaling, which may lead to reduced mitochondrial cal-cium accumulation and inhibition of mitochondrial permeabilitytransition pore (mPTP) opening [10\u201312]. Inhibition of mPTP open-ing is a critical end effector of the cardioprotective effects of IPost[11,13]. mPTP opening occurs during reperfusion and appears to behttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.04.029mailto:zlk30@tom.comhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.04.029http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokineH.-X. Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368 361a key event in the death of cardiomyocytes after a sequence of I/R.Opening of the nonspecific mPTP in the inner mitochondrial mem-brane results in collapse of the membrane potential (DWm),uncoupling of the respiratory chain, and efflux of cytochrome cand other pro-apoptotic factors, which may lead to apoptosis ornecrosis [14,15].In this study, we investigated changes in endogenous CYP2J3/11,12-EET levels in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes treated with hy-poxia preconditioning (HPC) and postconditioning (HPost) in vitroand observed the effect of upregulation of CYP2J3 or MS-PPOHinhibition on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We also systematicallyinvestigated multiple downstream apoptotic signals, includingchanges in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mPTPopening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, levels of cleavedcaspase-3 expression, and levels of protective kinases such asBcl-2 and Bax. Our data suggest that upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes involvescardioprotection by inhibition of apoptosis via a caspase-depen-dent pathway.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsNeonatal Wistar rats (1\u20133 days old) were provided by the Ani-mal Department of Capital Medical University. Fetal calf serum(FCS), Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), and strepto-mycin/penicillin were from Gibco BRL (Life Technologies, Paisley,UK). MS-PPOH was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA),and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis HLB) were fromWaters (Milford, MA, USA). Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 Transfection Re-agent, JC-1, and calcein-AM were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,USA), and CoCl2 was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Trizol re-agent and the reverse transcription system were from Promega(Madison, WI, USA). Sequences of oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR analysis were synthesized by Sai Bai Sheng (Beijing).

Isolation and culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytesThe hearts of rats were excised, and the ventricular myocar-dium was cut into small pieces (\ufffd2 mm3) in phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) buffer with trypsin (1.125 mg/ml), collagenase IFig. 1. Study groups and experimental protocol. Protocols for pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 and MSreoxygenation\u2013hypoxia; HPost, hypoxia post-conditioning; MS-PPOH, N-methylsulphon(1 mg/ml), and collagenase II (0.5 mg/ml) and incubated on a sha-ker for 20 min at 37 \ufffdC and 100 rpm. Tissue pieces were allowed tosettle, and the supernatant (containing myocytes) was collectedand suspended, then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cellpellet was resuspended and stored at 37 \ufffdC. The cells were thenresuspended in DMEM with 20% FCS and 0.5% penicillin/strepto-mycin for 30 min to facilitate separation of ventricular myocytesfrom the faster-attaching non-myocytes. The ventricular myocyteswere collected and plated on gelatin-coated dishes. Cells were usedfor experiments after demonstrating rhythmic contractions(48\u201372 h).2.3. Construction and identification of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3The total RNA was extracted from rat livers. The cDNA of CYP2J3was amplified by RT-PCR and OE-PCR and inserted into a pBS-Tvector. The recombinants were checked by PCR and digested by arestriction endonuclease. The CYP2J3 gene was confirmed byDNA sequencing and cloned into a eukaryotic expression vectorof the pcDNA3.1, and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 was produced. Culturedmyocardial cells of rats were transfected with pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3by a FuGENE HD transfection agent.2.4. Study groups and experimental protocolNeonatal rat cardiomyocytes were divided into seven groups fortreatment (Fig. 1): Control, no treatment; H/R, 3-h hypoxia followedby 2-, 5-, or 6-h reoxygenation; HPost, three cycles of 5-min reoxy-genation followed by 5-min hypoxia before 90-min reoxygenation;HPC, three cycles of 5-min hypoxia followed by 5-min reoxygena-tion before 2.5-h hypoxia; pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, transfectionfor 48 h, then H/R; MS-PPOH + HPost, MS-PPOH administered10 min before HPost; pcDAN3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH, pcDAN3.1-CYP2J3 transfection or MS-PPOH administration alone.2.5. Cell viability assayCell viability was determined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay [16]. Cells werecultured in 96-well plates, and MTT was added to each well understerile conditions (with a final concentration of 5 mg/ml) immedi-ately after reoxygenation. Plates were then incubated for 4 h at37 \ufffdC. The supernatant was removed, and dimethylsulfoxide wasadded. Plates were then agitated on a plate shaker. The absorbanceof each well was measured at 490 nm with a Wellscan MK 3 auto-mated EIA Analyzer (Labsystems Dragon, Taiwan).

Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368control cells was considered to be 100%, and that of other cells wasexpressed as a percentage of control.2.6. Quantification of 11,12-EET in cultured medium of neonatal ratcardiomyocytes11,12-EET was detected by high-performance liquid chroma-tography (HPLC) (Agilent 1100 System; Agilent Technologies, PaloAlto, CA, USA), as previously described [17]. Briefly, up to 200 llcultured medium was added to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with200 ll methanol and 0.4 ll of 96% formic acid on ice before centri-fugation at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The supernatant was trans-ferred to a fresh tube and diluted to 10% methanol by the additionof 1.8 ml water. The diluted supernatant was loaded onto a 1-mlOasis HLB SPE cartridge (Waters) on a vacuum manifold. The SPEcartridge had been preconditioned by low flow in the sequence1 ml methanol, 1 ml acetone, 2 ml hexane, 1 ml acetone, 1 mlmethanol, and 2 ml water. The cartridge was washed with 3 mlwater, then 1 ml of 10% methanol before being allowed to dry un-der argon for 10 min. The eicosanoid metabolites were collected byelution with 2 ml anhydrous acetonitrile and then dried under astream of argon. Standards or samples were dissolved in 136 llanhydrous acetonitrile, 4 lL N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and10 ll 2-(2,3-naphthalimino)ethyl-trifluoromethanesulfonate andkept at 4 \ufffdC for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with argonto evaporate the solution to dryness.Samples were resuspended in 40 ll methanol and analyzed byHPLC. Mobile phase A comprised 0.5% formic acid in water, andmobile phase B comprised 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile. A flowrate of 1 ml/min was used to deliver mobile phase A and B gradi-ents as follows: 50\u201365% mobile phase B for 4 min; 65\u2013100% mobilephase B for 80 min; and 100% mobile phase B for 20 min. The fluo-rescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 260 nmand emission wavelength of 396 nm. Concentrations of 11,12-EETwere calculated by comparison against a standard curve.2.7. Apoptosis assessmentWe used two methods to determine apoptosis of cardiomyo-cytes: nuclear staining with the chromatin dye Hochest 33258and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), widely used to detect DNA fragmentationin situ and performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Briefly, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at4 \ufffdC. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, then incubatedwith 50 ll TUNEL reaction mixture for 30 min at 37 \ufffdC. Diam-inobenzidine was used to generate an insoluble colored substrateat the site of DNA fragmentation. Finally, the cells were exposedto Hoechst 33258 (10 lg/ml) for 5 min and examined under amicroscope. For TUNEL analysis, the percentage of dead cells wascalculated as the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to total number ofcells, counted in three different random fields.2.8. Measurement of MMP by florescent JC1MMP was estimated by fluorescence of aggregates of JC-1 (tet-rachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethyl-60,6,50,5-benzamidazolocarbocyaniniodide) formed as a function of inner MMP. The formation of JC-1aggregates and their fluorescence linearly corresponds to increasesin membrane potential [18]. After treatment, cells plated on 24-well plates were incubated with 10 lg/mL JC-1 for 20 min at37 \ufffdC in a humidified incubator, then washed twice with PBS fordetection of the fluorescence ratio (for red fluorescence: excitation,490 nm and emission, 590 nm; for green fluorescence: excitation,490 nm and emission, 527 nm). We randomly selected the regionof interest, zoomed in the same frames. Data are presented asthe relative ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity.2.9. Determination of mPTP openingThe opening of the transient mPTP was directly assessed by co-loading with calcein-AM and CoCl2 as previously described [19].Calcein-AM is permeable to intact membranes, but not to intactmitochondrial membranes, and mPTP opening results in exit of cal-cein. Thus, the condition allows for monitoring of calcein fluores-cence in mitochondria of intact cells. In brief, cardiomyocyteswere loaded for 15 min with 2 lM calcein-AM in working solutionat room temperature and then washed free of calcein-AM and CoCl2.The rates of calcein-AM loading and exit were measured by record-ing the fluorescence signal every 5 min with the Turner QuantechDigital Filter Fluorometer (Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA,USA; excitation filter NB488 and emission filter SC515) and calcu-lated as the percentage change to maximal fluorescence signal.2.10. Isolation of mitochondriaIsolation of mitochondria was performed according to theinstructions for the Mitochondria/Cytosol Isolation Kit for CulturedCells. The cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of ice-coldMito-Cyto Buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugationtwice at 800g for 5 min at 4 \ufffdC, the supernatant was collected, trans-ferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 12,000g for10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The pellet, which contained the mitochondria, wasresuspended in 30 ll of Mito-Cyto Buffer for further use.2.11. Western blot analysisTotal protein (80 or 100 mg) isolated from neonatal rat cardio-myocytes was separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and blotted onto polyvinyl-idene difluoride (Hybond ECL, Amersham). The membranes wereblocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline\u2013Tween(TBST; 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 h atroom temperature before being incubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC withanti-CYP2J3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-Bcl-2 mousepolyclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-Bax rabbit polyclonal antibody(1:1000), anti-caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000), andanti-GAPDH goat monoclonal antibody (1:1000 in 0.5% milk inTBST). After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incu-bated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled or fluorescence-labeledsecondary antibody or in TBST. After extensive washing in TBST,membranes were developed by use of an enhanced chemilumines-cence kit.2.12. Statistical analysisAll values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD and were analyzedusing SPSS 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences betweengroups were assessed by one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni\u2019s testwas used for multiple comparisons. A p-value of < 0.05 was consid-ered significant.3. Results3.1.

Overexpression of CYP2J3 was associated with a signifi-cant increase in the CYP2J3 protein level (by 48.2%) compared withFig. 3. Cell viability of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.

Con, no treatment; H/R, 3-h hypoxiafollowed by 2-h reoxygenation; HPost, three cycles of 5-min hypoxia, then 5-minreoxygenation before 3-h prolonged hypoxia; pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 for 48 h, then 3-h hypoxia before 2-h reoxygenation; MS-PPOH + HPost, MS-PPOH (20 lM), then three cycles of 5-min hypoxia before 5-min reoxygenation,then 3-h prolonged hypoxia; pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 orMS-PPOH alone. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of optical density from the MTT assay. Data aremean \u00b1 SD (\u2044p < 0.05 compared with control, #p < 0.05 compared with H/R, &p < 0.05compared with HPost; n = 4).H.-X. Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368 363the control (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the content of 11,12-EET in thecultured medium was increased by 30.7% with overexpression ofCYP2J3 compared with the control (Fig. 2C). Thus, a single admin-istration of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes sig-nificantly increased both CYP2J3 protein expression and activityin vitro.3.2. Cell viabilityCompared with the control, H/R decreased cell viability by 45.5%(0.99 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.54 \u00b1 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.01), which suggests that theH/R model was successful (Fig. 3). Viability was ameliorated withHPost treatment (0.83 \u00b1 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.01) and overexpressionof CYP2J3 with H/R (0.81 \u00b1 0.09, p < 0.01), but not inhibition ofCYP2J3 (MS-PPOH treatment) with HPost (0.62 \u00b1 0.05, p < 0.01).Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on cellviability.3.3. CYP2J3/11,12-EET was upregulated during HPost, but not HPCCompared with the control, CYP2J3 protein expression in H/Rgroup decreased by 79.3% (2.08 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 0.43 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4,p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). The content of 11,12-EET with H/R was de-creased by 85.7% (0.56 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 0.08 \u00b1 0.02 ng/ll, n = 8, p < 0.01)(Fig. 4B). HPost, but not HPC, increased CYP2J3 protein expressionand 11,12-EET content [(0.43 \u00b1 0.07, H/R and 2.02 \u00b1 0.23, HPost;n = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A) and (0.08 \u00b1 0.02, H/R and 0.27 \u00b1 0.02,HPost; n = 8, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B), respectively]. Thus, HPost but notHPC upregulated the expression of CYP2J3/11,12-EET.Fig. 2. pcDNA3.1-mediated CYP2J3 epoxygenase overexpression and quantitative analysis of 11,12-EET expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.

Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET inhibited cardiomyocyteapoptosisHoechst 33258 staining revealed control cell nuclei had regularcontours and round or elliptical shapes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, H/Rcells showed smaller nuclei and condensed chromatin. HPost oroverexpression of CYP2J3 improved the morphological featuresand decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by H/R; how-ever, MS-PPOH before HPost impaired the morphological featuresand increased the number of apoptotic cells induced by H/R. Theapoptotic results were further confirmed by TUNEL staining(Fig. 5B). Almost no TUNEL-positive cells could be found with con-trol treatment, but many TUNEL-positive cells were found with H/R; the apoptosis ratio was 58.3% higher for H/R than for controltreatment (0.38 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.24 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.01). Comparedwith H/R, HPost or overexpression of CYP2J3 decreased the H/R-in-duced apoptosis by 31.6% (HPost, 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 0.26 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.05). Inhibition of CYP2J3 withMS-PPOH increased the apoptotic rate of HPost (0.33 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4,p < 0.05). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MS-PPOH alone had an ef-fect on cell apoptosis. Therefore, upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EETduring HPost inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis.3.5. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost decreased MMPand inhibited mPTP opening induced by H/RMMP is an important mediator and monitor of key cellular pro-cesses. It is a highly sensitive indicator of the energetic state ofmitochondria and the health of cells [20]. Detection of mitochon-drial permeability provides an early indication of the initiation ofcellular apoptosis. By JC-1 analysis, compared with the control, H/R increased MMP by 54.2% (1.0 \u00b1 0.17 vs. 1.54 \u00b1 0.41, n = 4,p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). Compared with H/R, HPost and overexpressionof CYP2J3 decreased MMP by 47% and 43%, respectively (HPost,0.81 \u00b1 0.17 and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 0.88 \u00b1 0.09, n = 4,p < 0.01). Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased MMP ofHPost by 153.1% (1.24 \u00b1 0.32, n = 4, p < 0.01). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MS-PPOH alone had an effect on MMP. Therefore,upregulation of the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system changed HPost-in-duced MMP.We investigated the occurrence and mode of mPTP opening inintact cells by monitoring the fluorescence of mitochondrial-en-trapped calcein. We used the calcein-AM and CoCl2 co-loadedmethod to measure mPTP opening (Fig. 6B). Compared with thecontrol, H/R decreased fluorescence intensity by 33.6%(1.52 \u00b1 0.08 vs. 1.01 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4, p < 0.01), which indicates in-creased mPTP opening; compared with H/R, HPost or overexpres-sion of CYP2J3 decreased mPTP opening, with fluorescenceincreased by 28.7% and 25.7%, respectively (HPost, 1.30 \u00b1 0.11and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 1.27 \u00b1 0.04, n = 4, p < 0.01). Inhibitionof CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH decreased the fluorescence intensity ofHPost by 37.7% (0.81 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.01). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on mPTP opening. There-fore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system decreased mPTP opening in-duced by H/R.3.6. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost inhibitedmitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and cleaved caspase-3 proteinexpressionIn the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, disruption ofDwm and release of cytochrome c activate a cascade of caspases,including caspase-3, a key and irreversible point in the develop-ment of apoptosis. Compared with the control, H/R induced seriousdamage to the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the leakageof cytochrome c from the mitochondria. However, the cytochromec content was significantly preserved in the HPost and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R groups. Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increasedthe leakage of cytochrome c in the MS-PPOH + HPost group. Nei-ther pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on theleakage of cytochrome c (Fig. 7).Compared with the control, H/R significantly increased cleavedcaspase-3 expression by 122.2% (1 vs. 2.22 \u00b1 0.39, n = 4, p < 0.01).HPost and overexpression of CYP2J3 significantly attenuated theH/R-induced increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression by 41.6%and 46.3%, respectively (HPost, 1.30 \u00b1 0.13 and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 1.19 \u00b1 0.23, n = 4, p < 0.05).Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased cleaved caspase-3expression of HPost by 59.6.0% (2.07 \u00b1 0.26, n = 4, p < 0.05). NeitherpcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on cleaved cas-pase-3 expression (Fig. 8). Therefore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET systemimproves apoptosis of HPost by decreasing caspase-3 expression.3.7. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET increased the ratio of Bcl-2 toBax expression induced by H/RThe Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-2 play important roles ininitiating the mitochondrial death cascade. We used western blotanalysis to investigate the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax andanti-apoptotic Bcl-2 underlying apoptosis reduced by the CYP2J3/EET system. Compared with the control, H/R significantly de-creased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression by 31.2% (1 vs.0.69 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig. 9). Compared with H/R, HPostand overexpression of CYP2J3 significantly increased the H/R-in-Fig. 5. Effect of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH on apoptosis.

Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOHdecreased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression of HPost by 24.5%(0.71 \u00b1 0.12, n = 4, p < 0.05). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 norMS-PPOH alone had an effect on the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expres-sion. Thus, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system improves apoptosis ofHPost by decreasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression.4. DiscussionIPost administered to hearts was previously found to have anadvantage over IPC; the endogenous CYP2J3/11,12-EET systemwas found to be upregulated by IPost, but not IPC, in the rat heart.We proposed that upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during IPostinduces cardioprotection by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosisand that multiple apoptotic signals, including changes in MMPand mPTP opening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, caspase-3 levels, and the ratios of expression of protective kinases suchas Bcl-2 and Bax, are involved in the process. Neonatal rat cardio-myocytes were exposed to H/R or HPost alone; transfected withpcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 for 48 h, then H/R; or treated with the CYP epox-ygenase inhibitor MS-PPOH 10 min before HPost. As with HPostalone, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection attenuated cardiomyocyteapoptosis to 68.4% of that with H/R. pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfectionsignificantly decreased MMP levels and inhibited mPTP openingand mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and cleaved caspase-3Fig. 6.

Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368 367inhibiting apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. This apop-tosis-suppressive effect may have important clinical implicationsduring HPost.Arachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid normallyfound esterified to cell membrane glycerophospholipids, can be re-leased by phospholipases in response to ischemia [21]. Free AA isthen available for metabolism by prostaglandin H2 synthases, lip-oxygenases, and CYP450 epoxygenases to generate numerousmetabolites, collectively termed eicosanoids [21]. Cardiac CYPepoxygenases metabolize AA to four regioisomeric EETs (5,6-;8,9-; 11,12-; and 14,15-EET), and CYP x-hydroxylases metabolizeAA to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) [22]. TheCYP450 pathway has recently been investigated in several animalmodels of I/R injury. Administration of EETs and overexpressionof mouse CYP2J3 resulted in cardioprotection [23]. Similarly, twoselective EET antagonists, 14,15-EEZE and 14,15-EEZE-PEG, andan EET synthesis inhibitor, MS-PPOH, blocked the cardioprotectiveeffects of IPost in the canine heart at doses that had no effect onischemia when given alone [24]. In a recent study of CYP2J2 trans-genic mice, the protective effect was observed in an isolated Lange-ndorff mouse heart [25]. In addition, EET biosynthesis wasenhanced in stenosed coronary arteries [26] and during cardiac I/R injury [27]. All of these data strongly suggest that EETs are in-volved in cardioprotection, but the mechanisms by which EETs ini-tiate their actions are not clear.EETs prevented apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes andin a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte cell line (HL-1) subjected to HR in-jury [28]. A finding in a renal proximal tubular epithelial cell linedemonstrated that EETs inhibited apoptosis induced by serumwithdrawal and etoposide [29]. Exogenous EETs increased humanendothelial cell survival and attenuated apoptosis [30]. CYP epox-ygenases markedly attenuated apoptosis and prevented both TNF-a activation of caspase-3 and TNF-a reduction of Bcl-2 expressionin cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells [31]. All of these datasuggest that EETs are involved in cardioprotection by inhibitionof apoptosis.We aimed to investigate the effect of upregulating CYP2J3 oradministering a specific inhibitor of CYP2J3 (MS-PPOH) on neona-tal rat cardiomyocytes to explore whether the CYP2J3/11,12-EETsystem is involved in the cardioprotection of HPost by inhibitingapoptosis. Endogenous CYP2J3/11,12-EET upregulated by HPost,but not HPC, in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro was consistentwith our previous results in rat hearts in vivo [9]. Similar to HPost,CYP2J3 overexpression significantly increased neonatal rat cardio-myocyte viability, as previously observed [29]. Moreover, similarto HPost, CYP2J3 overexpression significantly protected neonatalrat cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced apoptosis as evaluatedby Hoechst staining and TUNEL analysis. Importantly, inhibitionof CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased the apoptotic rate of HPost.Therefore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET pathway is an important regula-tor of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte apoptosis.The high energy demands of cardiac function are supplied byATP, produced mainly by mitochondria through oxidative phos-phorylation, glycolysis, and the Krebs cycle [32,33]. Ischemicevents can greatly alter mitochondrial function and thereby de-crease cardiac efficiency. This damage ultimately contributes tocontractile dysfunction, mPTP opening, and cell death. mPTP for-mation may be the event that leads to irreversible changes in cel-lular function and cell death [34]. During the early minutes ofreperfusion, IPost reduces oxidative stress and inhibits mPTP open-ing, independent of altered oxidative phosphorylation or DWm[35]. Perfusion with the mPTP-opener atractyloside abolished im-proved the post-ischemic functional recovery observed in heartswith CYP2J2 overexpression [36]. Moreover, UA-8, a syntheticcompound with both EET-mimetic and sEH-inhibitory properties,provided significant cardioprotection against I/R injury by limitingmitochondrial dysfunction [37]. Our results demonstrated thatsimilar to HPost, CYP2J3 overexpression significantly decreasedMMP and mPTP opening as evaluated by JC-1 staining and calce-in-AM and CoCl2 co-loading analysis. Furthermore, MS-PPOH abol-ished this effect; thus, CYP2J3/11,12-EET inhibited apoptosis bydecreasing MMP and mPTP opening.A diverse array of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli regulatesendothelial cell apoptosis by modulating the balance betweenthe pro-apoptotic caspases and various anti-apoptotic proteinssuch as Bcl-2. CYP epoxygenase overexpression significantly inhib-ited caspase-3 activity, and the time-dependent downregulation ofBcl-2 expression induced by TNF- a [36], which suggests that EETsinhibit the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins and maintain levels ofanti-apoptotic proteins. Our results showed that, similar to HPost,CYP2J3 overexpression significantly inhibited mitochondrialcytochrome c leakage, ameliorated increased cleaved caspase-3expression and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression. Furthermore,MS-PPOH abolished this effect; thus, mitochondrial cytochrome crelease, pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and apoptosis proteins such asBcl-2 and Bax are involved in the cardioprotection of CYP2J3/11,12-EET upregulation during HPost.In addition, several papers have suggested that the EETs are po-tent activators of the sarc KATP channel [38,39]. One paper sug-gests that they may also act via the mito KATP channel [40]. In amore recent study from this laboratory, Lu et al. [39] demonstratedthat the 11(S),12(R)-EET regioisomer activated the rat ventricularmyocyte sarc KATP channel. Seubert et al. showed that flavoproteinfluorescence, a marker of mito KATP channel activity [22], was sig-nificantly higher in cardiomyocytes obtained from CYP2J2 trans-genic animals than in those from wild-type mice. Taken together,368 H.-X. Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368these results suggest that the beneficial effects of activating theCYP epoxygenase pathway in the heart are mediated, at leastpartly, via opening of the sarc and/or mito KATP channel. WhetherKATP is involved in this cardioprotection effect of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost should be further studied.In conclusion, our study revealed that upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost induced cardioprotection by inhibitingapoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. This cardioprotection ef-fect appeared to involve decreased mPTP opening and attenuationof the H/R-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and acti-vation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and ratio of expression of apopto-tic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bax. Increased 11,12-EET biosynthesismay contribute to the survival of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Theapoptosis-suppressive effect of EETs may have important clinicalimplications during HPost, and modulation of CYP2J3-mediated11,12-EET biosynthesis may represent a novel therapeutic strategyfor the clinical establishment of IPost.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-dation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (no. 30770874).References[1] Murry CE, Jennings RB, Reimer KA.
