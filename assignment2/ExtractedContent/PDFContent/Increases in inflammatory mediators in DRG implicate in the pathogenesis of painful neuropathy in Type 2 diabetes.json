Reports have shown that activation of inflammatory cascades play an importantrole in the development and persistence of neuropathic pain states, but it is not well established in pain-ful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Previously, studies have shown increased inflammatory cytokines in theserum of the diabetic patients with painful neuropathy. This study focuses on the changes in the levels ofinflammatory mediators such as TNFa, interleukins, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules with thedevelopment of pain in the DRG of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an established model for T2D. Thisstudy also demonstrates an alteration in the levels of voltage gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) with thedevelopment of pain in DRG of the ZDF rats.Results: Pre-diabetic ZDF animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed no thermal and mechanical hyperalgesiacompared to their respective lean controls. Diabetic-ZDF animals tested for pain related behaviorsshowed significant thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at 4 and 6 weeks after the onset of diabeteswhen compared with their age matched lean controls. These ZDF animals with PDN also showed changesin a large number of inflammatory mediators in the DRG as assessed by Western blot as well as by cyto-kine antibody array compared to their age matched lean controls. Further analysis by Rat cytokine anti-body array of DRG of the ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeks after diabetes when compared with ZDFanimals with no pain revealed an elevation of a significant number of inflammatory mediators including,the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, interleukin-1, 6, 13 and 17, chemokines such as MIP1 and3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sICAM that are associated with pain phenotype. TheZDF animals with PDN also demonstrated an increase in the protein levels of voltage gated sodium chan-nel NaV1.7 in DRG compared to lean controls with no pain.Conclusions: The rise in inflammatory markers in the DRG of Type 2 diabetic animals and increases involtage gated sodium channel NaV1.7 in DRG with the onset of pain in PDN suggest that inflammationin the DRG may play an important role in the development of pain in this model.Published by Elsevier Ltd.RACTE1. IntroductionDiabetes mellitus is the most common cause of neuropathy inthe United States and pain is a significant complication of diabeticneuropathy occurring in 20\u201325% of patients with neuropathy andresulting in a significant adverse effect on quality of life measuresR [1]. Unfortunately, available medical treatment is relativelyineffective with limited efficacy and often complicated by side ef-fects and dependency [2,3]. The etiology of pain in diabetic neurop-athy is not well understood. Accumulating evidence suggests thatthe activation of inflammatory cascades in the peripheral and cen-tral nervous system may play a role in the development and persis-tence of neuropathic pain states induced by physical or toxic injuryto peripheral nerve [4,5].In diabetes there is evidence of systemic immune activation. Pa-tients with painful neuropathy have increased IL-2 and TNFamRNA and protein levels in blood [4]. Type 1 diabetes patientshave increased serum TNFa [6] and studies on patients withdiabetic painful neuropathy exhibit a different serum immuneprofile compared to patients with painless diabetic neuropathy,http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009&domain=pdfhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009mailto:munmunc@umich.eduhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine2 C. Galloway, M. Chattopadhyay / Cytokine 63 (2013) 1\u20135suggesting that immune markers in blood are associated with dia-betic neuropathic pain [7]. But, the relationship of these seruminflammatory markers to nociceptive pathways in the nervous sys-tem has not been explored. We undertook these studies to evaluatethe role of inflammatory mediators in DRG in T2D model of PDN.2. Methods2.1. Study design and behavioral testThe Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, Charles River, USA) rat, a sub-strain of the obese Zucker rat, is an established model for Type 2diabetes in which hyperglycemia initially manifests at about 8\u20139 weeks of age. A blinded researcher assessed thermal hyperalgesiaby measuring the latency to hind paw withdrawal from a thermalstimulus determined by exposing the plantar surface of the hindpaw to radiant heat using a modified Hargreaves thermal testingdevice. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an analgesim-eter (Ugo-Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy) by the Randall and Selitto pawpressure method as described previously [8].A2.2. Cytokine array and Western blotRat Cytokine Array (ARY008; R&D Systems, USA) was used tosimultaneously detect the relative expression of 29 cytokines, che-mokines and cell adhesion molecules. This antibody array detectsmultiple analytes in tissue lysates. L4\u2013L6 DRG from rats (n = 5)were homogenized and prepared according to manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. The sample protein concentrations were measuredusing a total protein assay [8]. Once the membranes were blocked,15 lL of reconstituted detection antibody cocktail were added toeach prepared sample. The samples with antibody cocktail werethen added to the membrane and incubated at room temperaturefor 1 h. The membranes were washed, followed by incubation withStreptavidin-HRP for 30 min. The intensity of each spot was deter-mined by quantitative chemiluminescence, using a PC-based im-age analysis system (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-RadLaboratories, USA); and pixel densities were quantitated by analyz-ing the array image file using image analysis software (Quanti-one4.6.1; Bio-rad Laboratories, USA). For western blot, L4\u2013L6 DRGfrom each animal considered as one sample (n = 5) were homoge-nized and prepared as described previously [8].R2.3. DRG culture experimentFor in vitro studies, adult rats were anaesthetized with chloralhydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.). DRG from these rats were collected anddissociated following 0.25% collagenase treatment for 1 h at 37 \ufffdCwith 0.25% trypsin, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)for 30 min at 37 \ufffdC with constant shaking and then plated on Lam-inin, poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips at 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate in 500 ll of defined neurobasal media containing B27,Glutamax I, Albumax II and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco-BRL,Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 100 ng/ml of 7.0S NGFper ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). 4 day old DRG neurons in cul-ture were incubated with 15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa,Sigma) for overnight and collected for qRT-PCR and western blotanalysis for NaV1.7 level in DRG (Supplementary Fig. 3).RET2.4. Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of the difference between groupswas determined by ANOVA (Systat 11) using Bonferroni\u2019scorrection for the multiple post hoc analyses. All results are ex-pressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.3. Results3.1. ZDF rats with Type 2 model of diabetes showed thermalhyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia 6 weeks after diabetesPre-diabetic animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed normal re-sponses similar to their age-matched lean controls (Fig. 1a). At2 weeks after diabetes, ZDF animals showed only significant de-crease in thermal latency (Fig. 1b; lean 14.93 \u00b1 2.2 s; ZDF10.67 \u00b1 1.8 s; P < 0.01) but no significant difference in mechanicalhyperalgesia compared to the lean controls. At 4 weeks (lean13.16 \u00b1 0.6 s; ZDF 10.18 \u00b1 0.9 s; P < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and 6 weeksafter the onset of diabetes, the ZDF animals showed significant de-crease in thermal latency (lean 12.93 \u00b1 1.2 s; ZDF 8.47 \u00b1 1.7 s;P < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and substantial decrease in paw withdrawalthreshold measured by Randall-Selitto method at 4 weeks (lean78.5 \u00b1 1.9 gm; ZDF 54.50 \u00b1 2.5 gm; P < 0.005) and 6 weeks (lean89.64 \u00b1 8.2 gm; ZDF 59.53 \u00b1 5.7 gm; P < 0.005; Fig. 1c and d) afterthe onset of diabetes.3.2. ZDF animals with pain-related behavior exhibited increasedNaV1.7 in DRGIn previous studies we and others have found that there is anincrease in the amount of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7(NaV1.7) in DRG of STZ-diabetic (a model of T1D) animals withPDN [8]. In this study, DRG were analyzed for expression of voltagegated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7 by Western blot to correlatethe changes in NaV1.7 with the changes in pain-related behaviors.We did not find any increase in the level of NaV1.7 in 8 weeks oldpre-diabetic ZDF animals without PDN (Fig. 1a and e). 2 weeksafter diabetes, ZDF animals showed significant increase in thermalhyperalgesia (P<0.01) but not mechanical hyperalgesia and a mod-erate increase in NaV1.7 (Fig. 1b and f). At 4 and 6 weeks after dia-betes, ZDF animals showed significant thermal and mechanicalhyperalgesia along with a substantial increase in NaV1.7 levels inDRG (Fig. 1c, d and g, h).3.3. ZDF rats with painful diabetic neuropathy demonstrated increasedneuroinflammation in DRGPre-diabetic ZDF animals showed no significant change in theexpression of any of the 29 pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemo-kines in DRG at 8 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 2) compared totheir age-matched lean controls. ZDF animals with PDN 6 weeksafter diabetes when compared with their respective age-matchedlean control animals showed a significant increase in 27 out of29 cytokine/chemokines/cell adhesion molecules; only 2 cytokines,IL-10 and IL-4, those have anti-inflammatory properties, did notchange in these animals (Supplementary Table 1).By Western blot of DRG, we found that ZDF animals at 6 weeksof diabetes exhibited significant increases in a number of inflam-matory markers, including tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), inter-leukin-1 b (IL1b) and phospho-p38 MAPK protein compared tolean control animals (Fig. 2a\u2013c). ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeksof diabetes when compared with pre-diabetic ZDF animals withoutPDN showed significant increases in 19 inflammatory mediators(Fig. 2d), including the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa,interleukin (IL)-1a and b, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-17, chemokines suchas MIP1 and 3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sI-CAM in DRG of ZDF with PDN.CTEDMechanical Hyperalgesia Thermal Hyperalgesia(a)Lean ZDF020406080100gm051015sec051015\u2217\u2217(b)020406080100gm\u2217\u2217020406080100gm101520\u2217005101520\u2217\u2217020406080100gm\u2217\u2217(c)(d)Lean ZDF\u03b2 actinNav1.7(e)Pre-diabeticLean ZDF\u03b2 actinNav1.7(f)2 weeks of diabetesLean ZDF\u03b2 actinNav1.7(g)4 weeks of diabetesLean ZDF\u03b2 actinNav1.7(h)6 weeks of diabetesSodim channel Nav1.7secsecsecLean ZDFLean ZDF Lean ZDFLean ZDF Lean ZDFLean ZDF Lean ZDFFig. 1. ZDF animals demonstrate pain-related behaviors at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of diabetes along with changes in NaV1.7 levels in DRG. (a) Pre-diabetic ZDF animals show nopain-related behaviors by paw withdrawal latency to noxious thermal stimuli and mechanical nociceptive threshold by Randall-Selitto test; (b) 2 weeks after diabetes, ZDFanimals demonstrate thermal hyperalgesia manifested by a decrease in thermal latency compared to control lean animals (\ufffdP < 0.01; n = 8) and show no change in mechanicalpain threshold compared to age-matched lean animals. ZDF rats at 4 weeks (c) and 6 weeks (d) after diabetes have shown a significant decrease in their mechanical andthermal pain threshold compared to age-matched lean controls (\ufffd\ufffdP < 0.005; n = 8). (e) Pre-diabetic ZDF animals at 8 weeks of age with no pain, show no change in NaV1.7levels by Western blot analysis. (f) ZDF rats at 2 weeks after the onset of diabetes show a modest increase in NaV1.7 levels in DRG compared to lean control (n = 5). ZDFanimals with PDN, at 4 weeks (g) and 6 weeks (h) after diabetes induction exhibit a significant increase in NaV1.7 levels in DRG (n = 5).C. Galloway, M.

Levels of NaV1.7 is altered by increased inflammation in culturedDRG neuronsTo determine whether increase in proinflammatory cytokineswould change the level of NaV1.7 in the neurons, adult DRG neu-rons in culture incubated with rTNFa overnight showed an in-crease in NaV1.7 protein and mRNA levels compared to untreatedcontrol cells.4. DiscussionInflammation plays a central role in the nervous system in re-sponse to injury which affects vasodilatation, increased vascularpermeability, cell migration, and pain. Extracellular signals associ-ated with inflammation may also lead to increased levels ofpro-nociceptive chemokines/receptors that directly contribute topersistent or chronic pain behavior [5].

ZDF rats with painful neuropathy have increased inflammatory markers in DRG compared to ZDF animals with no pain. ZDF animals at 6 weeks of diabetes exhibitedsignificant increases in inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa; a), interleukin-1 b (IL1b; b) and phospho-p38 MAPK (c) protein in the DRG of the animals withpainful neuropathy compared to lean control animals without painful neuropathy measured by Western blot analysis (n = 5). (d) ZDF animals with painful neuropathy at6 weeks after the onset of diabetes have shown an increase in a significant number of inflammatory markers in the DRG including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa,interleukin-1, 6, 13 and 17, chemokines such as MIP1 and 3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sICAM by rat cytokine antibody array compared to pre-diabeticZDF animals without any pain phenotype (n = 5).4 C. Galloway, M. Chattopadhyay / Cytokine 63 (2013) 1\u20135ACTEDcytokines elevated in the DRG of ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weekscompared to pre-diabetic ZDF without PDN in this study are TNFaand interleukins, particularly IL1a, IL1b, IL-6, IL13 and IL17. Thesecytokines have also been implicated in the development of hyper-sensitivity or pain in other models of neuropathic pain caused byphysical injury which are important for the regulation of immuneresponses and nociception [5]. Members of the CC and CXC familyof chemokines that are significantly increased compared to pre-diabetic ZDF animals without pain include CCL3 (MIP-1a) andCCL20 (MIP-3a) [9], CCL5 and CXCL10 (RANTES and IP-10) [10],CXCL7 (thymus cytokine) and CX3CL1 (Fractalkine), which areincreased in other models of neuropathic pain resulting from phys-ical injury to nerve and are implicated in behavioral hypersensitiv-ity and vascular inflammation [11]. Cell adhesion moleculesICAM-1 that represents important biomarker for inflammatoryprocesses [7] was also increased in ZDF animals with PDN. Inrecent past trophic factors have been implicated with pain in pa-tients. Trophic factors, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)which has been associated with hyperalgesia in ALS patients in aphase I trial, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) which was linked with severity of pain in patientswith bladder pain [12,13], were also elevated in ZDF animals withPDN in this study.To date, research focused on improving the treatment of chronicpain has largely ignored the role of inflammation-associated fac-tors in nociceptive pathways in the peripheral nervous system indiabetic subjects. In these studies, we found that a number of cyto-kines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules are altered in T2Danimals with PDN. Similar to our previous STZ-diabetic studies,these studies also documented that ZDF animals with pain demon-strate increased NaV1.7 levels in DRG. In recent studies it has beenshown that elevated levels of TNF-a are responsible for the up-reg-ulation of voltage gated sodium channel activity [14]. We foundRETRthat the adult DRG neurons in culture when pre-incubated with15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa) for overnight, to determinewhether the increase in proinflammatory cytokines would changethe level of NaV1.7 in the neurons, showed an increase in NaV1.7protein and mRNA levels compared to control cells. This prelimin-ary study suggests that TNFa plays an essential role in modulationof voltage gated sodium channel (Supplementary Fig. 3). We haveshown that ZDF animals with PDN starting at 2 weeks had a smallincrease in the levels of NaV1.7 compared to no change in the pre-diabetic ZDF animals without any pain. At 4 and 6 weeks after theonset of diabetes, DRG of the animals had significant increase inthe levels of NaV1.7. These animals at 6 weeks of diabetes alsoshowed an increased phosphorylation of p-38 in DRG along withsimultaneous changes in a number of proinflammatory cytokinesand chemokines as stated above. Hence, the results from this studymay suggest that the elevation of these inflammatory mediators inDRG may be responsible for the development of painful neuropa-thy in Type 2 diabetes, which may be associated with increasesin the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7. Therefore, the painfuldiabetic neuropathy may possibly be considered, at least in part, a\u2018neuro-inflammatory\u2019 condition. Taken together, a better under-standing of the role of these pro-nociceptive markers may lead tothe development of novel analgesic targets.AcknowledgementsThis work has funded by Pilot and Feasibility Grant from theMichigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (Award NumberR000617 to MC, from the NIDDK Grant 5P60-DK020572) andAmerican Diabetes Association (Grant #7-12-BS-021).
