The aim of thisstudy was to explore the role of SIRT1 signaling on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-17 and IL-23 production in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). IL-17 and IL-23 pro-duction was significantly increased in LPS-treated cells. LPS treatment also led to the upregulation ofSIRT1 mRNA and protein expression. LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 upregulation was attenuated by pre-treatment with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-jB, as well asneutralizing antibodies against Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4. Sirtinol treatment (a known SIRT1inhibitor) or SIRT1 knockdown by small interfering RNA blocked LPS-stimulated IL-17 and IL-23 expres-sion. Further investigation showed that LPS decreased osteoblast markers (i.e., ALP, OPN, and BSP) andconcomitantly increased osteoclast markers (i.e., RANKL and M-CSF). This response was attenuated byinhibitors of the PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, and SIRT1 pathways. These findings, for the first time, sug-gest that human periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS is implicated in periodontal disease bone destruc-tion and may mediate IL-17 and IL-23 release from hPDLCs. This process is dependent, at least in part, onSIRT1-Akt/PI3K-MAPK-NF-jB signaling.\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionPeriodontitis is a chronic destructive inflammatory disease ofteeth-supporting tissues [i.e., connective tissue of the periodontalligament and alveolar bone]. This inflammatory condition is initi-ated by a complex bacterial biofilm localized in the subgingivalenvironment, where Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major causativepathogen [1]. Elevated P. gingivalis levels are present in periodontallesions and are significantly reduced by successful therapy [2]. P.gingivalis modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a by gingival epithe-lial cells [3,4]. Several reports indicate that specific components ofP. gingivalis, including fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in-duce pro-inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8,and TNF-a) in human and murine monocytes and macrophagesll rights reserved.axillofacial Tissue Regenera-eogi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu,6; fax: +82 2 960 1457.corresponding author.[5,6]. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS leads to periodontal tissuedestruction and alveolar bone resorption through IL-6 and IL-8 re-lease from human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs; [7]), andthese inflammatory cytokines play a role in the destruction anddisintegration of the extracellular matrix [8]. We previously re-ported that hPDLCs may play an important role, as these cells pro-duce inflammatory cytokines, including receptor activator ofnuclear factor-jB ligand (RANKL; [9\u201314]), which is related to bonemetabolism in periodontal diseases. However, the mechanisms bywhich local immune responses against bacterial virulence factorsresult in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues remains tobe established.Among the inflammatory cytokines implicated in inflammatorydisease, much interest is focused on two recently identified cyto-kines: IL-23 and IL-17. IL-17 (also known as IL-17A), a pro-inflam-matory cytokine that is regulated by IL-23, is crucial for thedevelopment of a novel CD4+ T-cell subset called T-helper 17(Th17) cells, which promote tissue inflammation in host-defenseresponses against infection [15]. Enhanced IL-17 expression isreported in various inflammation models, including rheumatoidarthritis, periodontitis, asthma, and organ rejection [16\u201318]. Inhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021mailto:eckim@khu.ac.krhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokineY.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 285addition, IL-17 may affect osteoclast resorption indirectly throughosteoblasts, like other pro-inflammatory cytokines [19,20]. IL-17levels in inflamed gingival tissues of periodontitis are higher thanthose in healthy control tissues [16,21]. Similarly, the amount ofIL-17 in gingival crevicular fluid samples is significantly higher inperiodontitis patients [22,23]. Furthermore, IL-17RA-deficient micehave enhanced periodontal bone destruction following P. gingivalisinfection, suggesting a bone-protective role of IL-17 [24]. IL-23, aheterodimeric protein that is composed of the IL-12p40 subunitand a specific IL-23p19 subunit, is primarily produced by activateddendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages [25]. IL-23, in conjunc-tion with IL-1, then contributes to the expansion and maintenance ofTh17 cells that, once activated, release the cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F,IL-22, TNF-a, and IL-6, all of which can induce inflammatoryresponses [26]. Furthermore, high numbers of IL-17- and IL-23-expressing cells are present in the ileum of Crohn\u2019s disease [27],active uveitis of Bechet\u2019s disease [28], lupus nephritis [29], andgingival tissue of periodontitis patients [16].SIRT1 is a prominent member of the NAD+-dependent enzymefamily and affects a variety of cellular functions ranging from genesilencing, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation to en-ergy homeostasis [30\u201332]. Several recent studies implicated SIRT1in the regulation of inflammatory responses [33,34]. SIRT1 can alsoinhibit nuclear transcription factor-jB (NF-jB), a master transcrip-tion factor involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cyto-kines, which enhances cell death in response to the inflammatorycytokine TNF-a [35]. However, very little is known regardingwhether SIRT1 regulates LPS-induced IL-23 or IL-23 axis signaling,particularly in periodontitis bone destruction.This study was designed to gain further knowledge on the im-pact of P. gingivalis LPS on the regulation of IL-17 and IL-23 produc-tion, and homeostasis between osteoblastic and osteoclastic genesin hPDLCs. We also investigated potential mechanisms involved inthis process, including the role of SIRT1.Table 1Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers and conditions.Gene Sequence (50\u201330) Size(bp)Tm(\ufffdC)IL-17 Forward: CGATGACTCCTGGGAAGACCTC 490 60Reverse: GTGTGGGCTCCCCAGAGCTCTTAIL-23 Forward: GCAGATTCCAAGCCTCAGTC 524 60Reverse: TTCAACATATGCAGGTCCCAALP Forward: ACGTGGCTAAGAATGTCATC 475 55Reverse: CTGGTAGGCGATGTCCTTAOPN Forward: AATGAAAACGAAGAAAGCGAAG 347 55Reverse: ATCATAGCCATCGTAGCCTTGTBSP Forward: TGGAGATGACAGTTCAGAAG 333 52Reverse: GTACTGGTGCCGTTTATGCOPG Forward: TGCAGTACGTCAAGCAGGAG 575 56Reverse: TGACCTCTGTGAAAACAGCRANKL Forward: GCCAGTGGGAGATGTTAG 486 55Reverse: TTAGCTGCAAGTTTTCCCM-CSF Forward: ATGACAGACAGGTGGAACTGCCAGTGTAGAGG 437 60Reverse: TCACACAACTTCAGTAGGTTCAGGTGA TGGGCSIRT-1 Forward: GCAACATCTTATGATTGGCACA 820 60Reverse: AAATACCATCCCTTGACCTGAAb-Actin Forward: CATGGATGATGATATCGCCGCG 371 55Reverse: ACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTCG2. Materials and methods2.1. ReagentsSirtinol and LPS (from P. gingivalis) were purchased fromSigma\u2013Aldrich Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO). Human IL-17 ELISAKit was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN).Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against mouse TLR2, TLR4,IjB-a, NF-jB p65 and b-actin monoclonal antibodies were ob-tained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware Avenue, CA).Anti-human TLR2 and TLR4 monoclonal antibodies (Abcam, Cam-bridge, UK) were used for in vitro neutralization studies in hPDLcells. Antibodies (Abs) against phospho-ERK (p-ERK), ERK, phos-pho-p38 (p-p38), p38, phospho-JNK (p-JNK), and JNK were pur-chased from Cell Signaling.

Cell cultureImmortalized hPDLCs, transfected with human telomerase cata-lytic component (hTERT), were kindly provided by professor TakashiTakata (Hiroshima University, Japan) [37]. Cells were cultured ina-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and100 lg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at37 \ufffdC.2.3. Western blot analysisCells (1 \ufffd 106) from each set of experiments were harvestedand washed twice in cold tris-buffered saline. Cells weresolubilized in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After 30 minon ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins(20 lg) were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE (10% acrylamide), transferredto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific Abs(diluted 1/1000), followed by incubation with secondary HRP-con-jugated Ab (1/5000). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemilu-minescence system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructionsand exposed to X-ray film. Densitometricanalysis of each blotwas performed with a computerized image processing system(Quantity One; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).2.4. RNA isolation and Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR)Cells (5 \ufffd 105) were cultured in 60-mm culture dishes until 70%confluency, and incubated for 24 h in a serum free medium con-taining stimuli as indicated. The total RNA of pulp cells was ex-tracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg,MD) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Then 1 lg RNAwas reverse-transcribed for first strand cDNA synthesis (GibcoBRL, Rockville, MD).

Statistical analysisDifferences among the groups were analyzed using one-wayanalysis of variance combined with the Duncan\u2019s multiple rangetests.3. Results3.1. Effects of LPS on IL-17, IL-23, and SIRT1 mRNA and proteinexpressionTo investigate whether LPS could induce IL-17 and IL-23cytokines in hPDLCs, cells were stimulated with various LPSconcentrations, and cytokine production was measured by reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot-ting, and ELISA (Fig. 1A\u2013F). IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA and proteinexpression were upregulated by LPS in a time- and concentra-tion-dependent fashion, with cytokine accumulation peaking at1 lg/ml 24 h LPS posttreatment (Fig. 1A\u2013D). After 24 h LPS stimu-lation, hPDLCs secreted significant amounts of IL-17; a LPS concen-tration of 1 lg/ml induced the largest production (Fig. 1E and F).To understand the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced cell signalingprocesses, we first assessed the expression of SIRT1 mRNA and pro-tein by RT-PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A\u2013D, LPStreatment significantly increased SIRT1 protein and mRNA levelsin a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a maximaleffect at 1 lg/ml for 24 h. LPS (1 lg/ml) did not adversely affect cellviability (data not shown) and was thus used in subsequentexperiments.3.2. Signaling pathways of LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expressionTo determine the signaling pathways involved in the upregula-tion of IL-17 and IL-23 expression by LPS in hPDLCs, we examinedthe activation states of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB. LPS treatmentinduced phosphorylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK without affect-ing the total levels of these kinases. In addition, LPS treatmentincreased the NF-jB p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degrada-tion in hPDLCs (Fig. 2).To further examine the roles of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB in LPS-in-duced IL-17 and IL-23, pharmacological inhibitors of signalingintermediates were used. Pretreatment with inhibitors of phospha-tidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002 and wortmannin), p38(SB203580), ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), and NF-jB (pyrroli-dine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) blocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17,and IL-23 expression, and IL-17 secretion in hPDLCs (Fig. 3A\u2013C).To determine whether the increased SIRT1 level was associatedwith LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression, hPDLCs were pre-treated with the pharmacological SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol. After1 h sirtinol pretreatment, cells were treated with LPS for 24 hand subjected to immunoblot analysis. The data showed thatLPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 expression and that IL-17secretion was attenuated by sirtinol pretreatment (Fig. 3A\u2013C).3.3. Effects of signaling pathway inhibitors on LPS-induced osteogenicand osteoclastogenic gene expressionTo investigate the putative mechanism linking IL-17 and IL-23to alveolar bone homeostasis, we analyzed the expression patternof osteogenic and osteoclastogenic genes associated with bone-lossconditions. As shown in Fig. 4, LPS treatment concomitantly down-regulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopon-tin (OPN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) mRNA expression, andupregulated the expression of nuclear factor j B-ligands (RANKL)and macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF), but notosteoprotegerin (OPG). Treatment with sirtinol, LY294002 andwortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), U0126(ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and PDTC (NF-jB inhib-itor) blocked the effects of LPS on the upregulation of RANKL andM-CSF, and downregulation of ALP, OPN, and BSP mRNA expression(Fig. 4). The vehicle control was 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)because sirtinol was dissolved in DMSO.3.4. Functional role of TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced responseSince TLR2 or TLR4 serves as the main mediator of responses toLPS, we initially examined whether LPS influenced the expressionof TLR2 and TLR4 in hPDLCs. Following LPS exposure, TLR2 andTRL4 protein levels increased in a time- and concentration-depen-dent manner (Fig. 5A and B). To assess the functional involvementof TLR2 and TLR4 in LPS-induced cytokine response of hPDLCs, cellswere incubated with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody(10 lg/ml) before LPS stimulation. Antibody specificity wasassessed by incubating with control IgG from non-immunizedFig. 3. Effects of various signaling pathway inhibitors on P. gingivalis-induced IL-17, IL-23, and SIRT1 expression. Cells were preincubated with (A) medium only or withwortmannin (WM; PI3K inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), sirtinol (SIRT1 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor),PDTC (NF-kB inhibitor), or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 1 h.

In addi-tion, treatment of cells with anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodiesblocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 upregulation, butIgG1 and IgG2a did not (Fig. 6A\u2013C). The anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2antibodies also attenuated LPS-induced osteogenic and osteoclas-togenic gene mRNA expression (Fig. 6D).3.5. Effect of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced responsesTo further confirm the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced IL-17, IL-23,and osteoblastic and osteoclastogenic gene expression, we knockeddown SIRT1 with a specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 7A, SIRT1 siRNAsuccessfully knocked down SIRT1 expression in hPDLCss andblocked LPS-induced IL-17 secretion, expression of the mRNAsencoding IL-17 and IL-23, osteoblastic genes (ALP, OPN, BSP), andosteoclastogenic genes (RANKL and M-CSF), whereas transfectionof cells with an equivalent amount of nonspecific siRNA had noeffect (Fig. 7B\u2013E).To elucidate the molecular basis of the responses to SIRT1 inhi-bition, we examined the effects of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced Akt,MAPK, and NF-jB signaling pathways in hPDLCs. As shown inFig. 8, SIRT1 siRNA pretreatment decreased LPS-induced phosphor-ylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK, and the degradation of IjBa andthe nuclear translocation of p65 (NF-jB).4. DiscussionPeriodontal disease is triggered by potentially hazardous micro-organisms, which induce consequent immune-inflammatory re-sponses. IL-17 treatment of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs)leads to IL-6 production, and IL-8 and intercellular adhesion mole-cule (ICAM)-1 expression [37], which may contribute to local tissueinflammation. Furthermore, IL-17 induces RANKL expression viainduction of prostaglandin E2 production in osteoblasts and isreleased by IL-23 stimulation [38,39]. Moreover, both IL-23 andIL-27 inhibit bone marrow cell osteoclastogenesis induced byM-CSF/soluble RANKL [40]. Whether the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is in-volved in periodontal bone destruction is unclear, although in-creased IL-17 and IL-23 levels are found in gingival tissue andcrevicular fluid of patients with periodontitis [16,21\u201323]. There-fore, our study was designed to investigate the association be-tween periodontal bone loss and production of IL-23 and IL-17by the periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS in hPDLCs.As primary hPDLCs are heterogeneous cell populations withvaried proliferative potential, long-term culture of hPDLCs is aptto reduce the number of cells with low proliferative potential, sothat their primary phenotype is lost [41]. Consequently, reproduc-ible results are difficult to obtain and the biology and regenerativemechanism of hPDLCs is difficult to clarify by using primary cells[42]. Therefore, to address this issue, we used immortalizedhPDLCs, which retain the features of their original primary cells,Fig. 6. Effect of blocking TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 production (A\u2013C), SIRT1 expression (A and B), and osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (D). Cells werepreincubated with or without TLR2 or TLR4 mAbs or isotype control (IC) abs for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 24 h. Histogram is densitometricquantitation of mRNA or protein expression. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the controlgroup, p < 0.05. #Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.290 Y.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293viz., hPDLCs [36]. In addition, Kitagawa et al. [36] demonstratedthat F-spondin increased the expressions of ALP, OCN, and BSPmRNA, and ALP activity in immortalized hPDLCs. Thus, immortal-ized this cell line is helpful tools for studying the biology andregenerative mechanisms of hPDLCs.LPS is a well-known endotoxin which elicits a variety of inflam-matory responses. In humans, LPS binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2receptor complex, which triggers the signaling cascade for manycell types to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide[43]. LPS-treated hPDLCs were found to respond to the endotoxinby activation of TLR4 and TLR2, promotion of NF-jB subunit p65translocation to the nucleus and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [13,44]. To examine the role of IL-17 andIL-23 signaling in the LPS response, we first analyzed IL-17 andIL-23 protein and mRNA levels. Our results indicate that LPSinduces IL-17 and IL-23 expression and IL-17 secretion in a time-and concentration-dependent manner, which is consistent withthe previous finding that LPS stimulates pro-inflammatory cyto-kines such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-12 in hPDLCs[13,44,45]. Following LPS exposure, parallel to IL-17 and IL-23upregulation, we detected increased protein and mRNA levels ofSIRT1. These results are consistent with our previous study, whichshowed that SIRT1 mRNA and protein is upregulated by LPS andheat stress in dental pulp cells [33].Akt/PI3K, MAPK, and NF-jB pathways play a pivotal role inpro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine regulation [18,32\u201334].Our results demonstrated that LPS activated Akt/PI3K, p38, JNK,ERKK, and NF-jB pathways in hPDLCs. Based on the results of acytotoxicity assay, we used optimal inhibitor concentrations ofPI3K (20 lM LY294002 and 100 nM wortmannin), ERK (20 lMPD98059), p38 MAPK (20 lM SB203580), JNK (10 lM SP600125),and NF-jB (1 mM PDTC) that elicited inhibitory effects withouttoxicity. Our results showed that SB203580, PD98058, SP600125,wortmannin, LY294002, and PDTC downregulated LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23, which suggests that Akt/PI3K, ERK, p38, JNK, andNF-jB mediate LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression in HDP cells.Consistent with our data on hPDLCs, IL-17 produced by activatedrheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells is com-pletely or partly blocked in the presence of the PDTC, wortmannin,and LY294002 [18].Fig. 7. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels (A and B), osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (C), and IL-17 and IL-23 production (D\u2013F).

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.Histogram is densitometric quantitation of mRNA or protein expression. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the control group, p < 0.05. #Statistically significantdifference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.Y.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 291TLR2 and TLR4, transmembrane receptors that transmit the LPSsignal to intracellular components in signal transduction path-ways, play important roles in the immune system [46]. TLR4 isassociated with the recognition of Gram-negative bacterial LPS,and TLR2 is regarded as the receptor for Gram-positive bacteria[47]. Tabeta et al. [48] reported that P. gingivalis LPS stimulateshuman gingival fibroblasts to secrete IL-1 and IL-6 via TLR4. Incontrast, Zhang et al. [49] found that P. gingivalis LPS could utilizeboth TLR2 and TLR4 to induce the production of cytokines such asTNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in THP-1 cells. In the present study, we ob-served that TLR4 and TLR2 expression increased in hPDLCs exposedto P. gingivalis LPS and that neutralizing anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4antibodies specifically inhibited P. gingivalis LPS-induced expres-sion and secretion of IL-17 and IL-23, as well as Akt/PI3K activationand its downstream pathways, including MAPK and NF-jB. Theseresults suggest that TLR2 and TRL4 play important roles in thedefense mechanisms of microorganisms by stimulating a widerepertoire of signal transduction pathways that promote inflam-matory processes.Recent studies implicated SIRT1 in the regulation of inflamma-tory responses [32\u201334]. Resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation oradenoviral-mediated SIRT1 overexpression blocks the expressionand release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to environ-mental stress [50,51]. To assess the role of SIRT1 in IL-17 and IL-23expression in hPDLCs, we tested the effects of SIRT1 inhibition andgene silencing. In the present study, we showed that downregulat-ing SIRT1 expression via SIRT1 siRNA or blocking SIRT1 activity viasirtinol prevented LPS-mediated induction of IL-17 and IL-23expression and production. This result is consistent with the previ-ous finding that inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reduces cytokineFig. 8. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced Akt, MAPK, and NF-kBactivation. Cells were transiently transfected with control vector or SIRT1 siRNA,followed by 1 h LPS treatment. Histogram is densitometric quantitation of proteinexpression. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.#Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.292 Y.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293production in a rodent model of smoke-induced airway inflamma-tion [52], attenuates hepatic injury and pro-inflammatory cytokineproduction in rats [53], diminishes human dermal microvascularendothelial cell inflammatory responses to TNF-a and IL-1b [54],and blocks HMGB1-stimulated osteoclastic cytokines, includingRANKL in hPDLCs [34]. These results suggested that SIRT1 inhibi-tion may modulate the inflammatory response to periodontalpathogens in hPDLCs.In the present study, downregulation of SIRT1 expression levelsby siRNA diminished LPS-stimulated Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB activa-tion. This may indicate that SIRT1 plays a modulatory role withinthe LPS signaling cascade. Reciprocally, we observed inhibitorsfor Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB blocked LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA andprotein expression. These results suggested that SIRT1 activationmay be an important upstream target of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jBin the regulation of hPDLCs. Consistent with these findings, we pre-viously reported that inhibitors for PI3K, MAPK and NF-jB blockedthe mechanical stress-induced SIRT1 mRNA expression in hPDLCs[32]. Overall, the above findings suggest that direct functionalinteraction between SIRT1 and LPS signaling does exist in hPDLCsculture models.Periodontal inflammation affects the net loss of bone by en-hanced resorption and diminished bone formation. hPDLCs haveosteoblastic properties and express ALP, OPN, and BSP [55].Moreover, hPDLCs express RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF [11,14,34],which contribute to bone metabolism regulation, such asosteoclastogenesis. To evaluate hDPLCs differentiation status, weanalyzed the mRNA expression of different genes involved inosteoblast (ALP, OPN, and BSP) and osteoclast differentiation(RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF). Our data demonstrated that LPS down-regulated osteoblastic differentiation marker mRNA (ALP, OPN, andBSP) and concomitantly upregulated the expression of osteoclastdifferentiation markers (RANKL and M-CSF). These results are con-sistent with a previous study on the osteoclastic-inducing effects[56] and osteoblastic-inhibiting effects of P. gingivalis LPS [57]. Inthe present study, hPDLCs pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K,p38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 antibodies,sirtinol, and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-induced upregulation ofosteoclast markers (RANKL and M-CSF) and prevented downregu-lation of osteoblast markers (ALP, OPN, and BSP). Furthermore,SIRT1 inhibition by sirtinol and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-inducedactivation of Akt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB. These results sug-gest that SIRT1, AKt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB, TLR2, andTLR4 pathways are involved in these responses. Further studiesare needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of action of LPSon SIRT1 signaling.To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate thatSIRT1, Akt/PI3K, MAPK, NF-jB, TLR2, and TLR4 signaling pathwaysare involved in regulating the Th17-related molecules IL-17 and IL-23, which are stimulated by P. gingivalis LPS treatment in hPDLCs.Pharmacological modulation of SIRT1 may be a novel therapeuticapproach for modulating the inflammatory response and bonedestruction associated with periodontal disease.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Mid-career Researcher Programthrough National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant fundedby the (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) (No.2009-0078526).References[1] Haffajee AD, Socransky SS.
