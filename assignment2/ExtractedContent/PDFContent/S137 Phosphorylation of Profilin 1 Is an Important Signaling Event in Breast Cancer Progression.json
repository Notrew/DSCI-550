Bin Omar,Surya S. Singh*Department of Biochemistry, Osmania University, Hyderabad, A.P., IndiaAbstractBackground: Profilins are actin-modulating proteins regulating many intracellular functions based on their multiple anddiverse ligand interactions. They have been implicated to play a role in many pathological conditions such as allergies,cardiovascular diseases, muscular atrophy, diabetes, dementia and cancer. Post-translational modifications of profilin 1 canalter its properties and subsequently its function in a cell. In the present study, we identify the importance ofphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 (S137) residue in breast cancer progression.Methods/Principal Findings: We found elevated profilin 1 (PFN) in human breast cancer tissues when compared toadjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of wild-type profilin 1 (PFN-WT) in breast cancer MCF7 cells made them moremigratory, invasive and adherent independent in comparison to empty vector transfected cells. Mutation in serinephosphorylation site (S137) of profilin 1 (PFN-S137A) significantly abrogated these properties. Mutation affecting actin-binding ability (PFN-R74E) of profilin 1 enhanced its tumorigenic function whereas mutation affecting its poly-L-prolinebinding function (PFN-H133S) alleviated these mechanisms in breast cancer cells. PFN-WT was found to activate matrixmetalloproteinases by zymography, MMP2 and MMP9 in presence of PDBu (phorbol 12, 13 dibutyrate, PI3K agonist) toenhance migration and invasion in MCF7 cells while PFN-S137A did not. Phosphorylation increased migration and invasionin other mutants of profilin 1. Nuclear profilin levels also increased in the presence of PDBu.Conclusions: Previous studies show that profilin could be executing a dual role in cancer by either suppressing orpromoting tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner. In this study we demonstrate for the first time thatphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 enhances oncogenic properties in breast cancer cells. Inhibitors targeting profilin1 phosphorylation directly or indirectly through inhibition of kinases that phosphorylate profilin could be valuabletherapeutic agents that can alter its activity and thereby control the progression of cancer.Citation: Rizwani W, Fasim A, Sharma D, Reddy DJ, Bin Omar NAM, et al.

Early detection and treatment isprolonging life expectancy in breast cancer patients. Mortality dueto breast cancer has decreased significantly in the past decade;however, many patients die due to disease relapse and metastasis.While many nonmetastatic breast tumors are initially hormonedependent, most acquire hormonal autonomy at later stages tobecome metastatic [2]. Cell migration and invasion are importantsteps towards breast cancer progression and metastasis that requiredynamic cytoskeletal and cell membrane rearrangement for cellmotility. Profilin (PFN), an actin modulating protein, is anabundant cytoskeletal protein and widely distributed in eukaryoticcells [3]. Profilin and its isoforms are considered to be importantregulators of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Under in vitro condi-tions, profilin in high amounts inhibits actin polymerization bysequestering actin monomer from F-actin or, inversely whenpresent in low amounts promotes actin polymerization inappropriate circumstances [4\u20136]. It has been shown that profilin1 promotes membrane protrusion, cell migration and invasionwhile profilin 2 suppresses these processes in breast cancer [7]. Itsinteraction with PI(4,5)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate),a component of the phosphatidylinositol cycle, serves as a linkthrough which the signaling pathways communicate with thedynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [8,9]. Post-translationalmodifications (PTM), such as nitration and phosphorylation, ofprofilin 1 have biological implications [10\u201312]. Phosphorylation atserine residue (S137) allows it to interact with greater affinity toPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/www.cdc.govhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103868&domain=pdfactin and proline rich proteins such as p85a, the regulatorysubunit of PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase), a lipid kinase withtumor promoting activity [12]. It is increasingly evident thatprofilin is associated with important signaling proteins known to beinvolved in transformation, such as PI3K (apoptosis) and ProteinKinase C (PKC) (tumorigenicity) [13,14]. However, the role ofserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer remains to beexplored.Profilin 1 has been extensively studied in breast cancer cell linesand mouse models for breast cancer [14\u201316]. Immunohistochem-ical analysis of human breast cancers revealed intermediate to lowlevels of profilin 1 expression [16]. Differential expression ofprofilin was reported in different cancers suggesting the complexityin the role of profilin in cancer [17,18]. Studies supporting its rolein cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancerdiffered suggesting a dichotomous role for profilin 1 in breastcancer progression thereby necessitating further studies in thisarea. Among its different ligands, it is reported that profilin\u2019sfunction as a tumor suppressor depends on its actin binding ability[17]. Our present data on human breast cancer tissues fromIndian population revealed enhanced expression of profilin 1when compared to adjacent normal tissues of the breast. Previousdata from our lab demonstrated that phosphoprofilin (S137) bindsto actin monomers with higher affinity and therefore might alteractin polymerization. Any change in actin polymerization affectscell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. A recent studydemonstrated similar effects due to phosphorylation of profilin attyrosine Y129 and its potential role in facilitating adult angiogen-esis in tissue wound healing [10]. Phosphoprofilin (pY129) alsofacilitated glioblastoma progression by endothelial secretion ofangiocrine factors that induced hypoxia inducible factor 1a(HIF1a) stabilization and accumulation in normoxic conditions[19]. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137could be crucial in breast cancer progression. Studies presentedhere demonstrate that S137 phosphorylation of profilin 1 not onlyaugment migration and invasion in breast cancer cells (MCF7) butalso enable them to become anchorage independent. Othermutations in profilin 1 that hinder profilin\u2019s interactions with actinor poly-L-proline (PLP) containing proteins demonstrated en-hanced tumorigenic properties indicating the significance ofserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer progression and thepotential in making pS137 a chemotherapeutic target to curbbreast cancer.Materials and MethodsSubjectsPrimary, non-invasive and invasive breast carcinomas followingradical mastectomy at different tumor stages (T1-4N0-1M0) offemale human subjects (27 ductal carcinoma and 3 lobularcarcinoma cases) belonging to varying age groups from 40\u201370years were used for the study. Normal tissue adjacent to the tumorfrom the same breast was used as control. The nature of the tissuewas confirmed by histopathological studies. Prior written consentfrom patients was obtained before tissue samples were collectedfollowing mastectomy and the samples were not exclusively usedfor this study and not meant for commercial use. The study andthe method of tissue collection were approved by the \u2018\u2018InstitutionalEthics Committee for Biomedical Research\u2019\u2019, Hyderabad, Indiaand Osmania University.Collection and processing of breast tissue samplesAfter surgical resection (mastectomy), samples were collected inice-cold Tris- buffered saline (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2 and 0.9%NaCl) and immediately processed for future analysis. Tissues wereground in Remi homogenizer on ice in tissue lysis buffer (40 mMTris buffer, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM b-ME, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 130 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF,1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at160006g for 20 min at 4uC. The supernatant obtained was usedfor western blotting analyses.Isolation of primary epithelial cells from breast tissue1 g of breast tissue (tumor and normal) derived after mastec-tomy was cut up manually into small pieces, approximately 0.5 cmcubed, collected and washed in ice-cold Kreb\u2019s Ringer buffer(116 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.6 mMNaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 22 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose,pH 7.4). The tissue was digested overnight at 37uC in a shakingincubator at 50 rpm with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (Type IV, sigma)in 5 ml RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 media containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 100U of penicillin/ml, 100 mg streptomycin/ml and10% fetal calf serum). Following enzyme digestion, the fat layerwas decanted by centrifuging at 10006g for 5 min at roomtemperature (RT) and washed several times with the buffer. Thecell-rich supernatant was backflushed through 60 m and 50 mmeshes to isolate breast organoids from red blood cells, fibroblastsand endothelial cells. The cells were disaggregated by pipetting inmedia containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA followed by filtrationthrough 40 m meshes. The cell pellet was collected and washedthree more times to yield a predominantly single cell suspension[20]. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml media and thecells were counted on cytometer after trypan blue staining. Thecells were lysed in M2 lysis buffer (20 mM tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaF,5 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mg/ml protease inhibitor cocktail) andthe lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 120006g for 15 min at4uC.Cell CultureMCF7 cells were purchased from NCCS (National Center forCell Science), Pune, India (previously published in [21]). MCF7cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 0.01 mg/ml Insulin,10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.MCF7 cells transfected with profilin 1 and mutants weremaintained in the above media supplemented with 800 mg/mlG418. Insulin and G418 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,USA.Western blot analysesTotal protein in clear supernatants obtained from breast tissueand cell lysates was estimated by Bradford\u2019s method according tothe manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 mg protein fromtissue lysates and cell lysates was subjected to 10% tricine SDS-PAGE [22] and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Themembrane was blocked with 3% gelatin in TTBS buffer (10 mMTris, 154 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) for 1 hr, thenwashed with TTBS (4610 ml) and incubated with rabbit anti-profilin 1 antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Novus biologicals) or rabbitanti-PKCf antibodies (1:500, in-house) and anti-actin antibodies(1:3000, Sigma) for 2 hr. After washings with TTBS, the blot wasincubated with horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary anti-rabbit/anti-mouse goat IgG for 2 hr. The blot was thencolorimetrically developed using NBT/BCIP (Amersham Phar-macia Biotech).Phosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer ProgressionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868Figure 1.

GST clonesof profilin-1 WT, R74E and H133S (characterized by [23,24]were subcloned into EGFP-C1 vector using forward primer: 59-AGC CAA GCT AGT GCC GGG TGG AAC GCC- 39 andreverse primer: 59- CAG GGA TCC TCA GTA CTG GGA ACGCCG AAG-39. Similarly, S137A from pcDNA3 construct [25] wassubcloned into EGFP-C1 vector. All inserts were cloned betweenHindIII and BamH1 restriction sites (forward primer: 59- CCAAGC TTC GAT GGC CGG GTG GAA CG-39 and reverseprimer: 59- GCGGATCC CTA GTA CTG GGC ACG CCG A-39). All the constructs including empty vector (eGFP-N1) wereconfirmed by plasmid sequencing (Invitrogen). These constructswere then overexpressed by transfection in MCF7 cells.Transfection and generation of cell linesMCF7 cells were transfected with a control EGFP-N1 vector orfollowing profilin1 expressing constructs: GFP-PFN1-WT (Wild-Type, human), GFP-PFN1-S137A (serine 137 phosphorylationmutant), GFP-PFN1-R74E (actin mutant) or GFP-PFN1-H133S(PLP binding mutant). For transfection, 0.5 mg plasmid DNA wasmixed along with 1 ml of transfection reagent (chloroform:DT-DEAC lipid micelles made in laboratory) [26] in a total volume of200 ml serum-free MEM media. The transfection mix wasincubated at room temperature for 30 min, following which itwas added to 20,000 MCF7 cells pre-incubated in serum-freeMEM media for 1 hr. After 5 hr of transfection, media waschanged to complete MEM media and cells were allowed to growfor 24 hr for protein expression. Selection media with 800 mg/mlG418 was added and polyclonal populations were selected over aperiod of two weeks.Cell Viability AssayTo determine cell growth of transfected clones, 2000 cells ofeach clone were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and cellviability was assessed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay at 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and7days. MTT reagent (diluted from a 4 mg/ml solution in PBS) wasadded to all the wells at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml andthe cells were further incubated for 4 hr at 37uC. The reaction wasterminated by adding 200 ml/well dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) andabsorbance was read at 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Wellscontaining complete media alone was used as blank and theaverage values subtracted from the average values of all clones.The assay was repeated three times and analyzed using two-sidedStudent\u2019s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d and p,0.005was considered significant.Soft agar growth assayAnchorage independent growth was assayed by the soft agargrowth assay as described elsewhere [27]. The first step involvedplating a bottom layer of 0.6% agar in serum-free media in 12-wellplates. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minto solidify the agar. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and16104 cells were mixed with 0.3% agarose (made in completemedia) and layered carefully on the top of existing 0.6% agarose.The plates were covered with 1 ml of medium supplemented with10% FBS and incubated at 37uC in a 5% CO2 incubator for10days. Complete media was added every 2 days to the test wells.At the end of 10days, cell colonies with .100 mm in diameterwere imaged and counted under a microscopic field at 2.56magnification. Mean colony count was based on numbers from 5different fields imaged under 2.56 magnification from twoindependent experiments done in duplicate for each treatmentcondition and was analyzed using two-sided Student\u2019s t test.Wound healing assay56104 cells were plated in a 6-well plate in triplicate andallowed to grow to confluency. Cells were washed and left inserum-free media for 5 hr. A scratch was made and media wasadded that was either only serum-free or with 200 nM PDBu(phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) or with 20 mM LY294002/200 nMPDBu. Images were captured at 106 magnification using LeicaMicroscope at zero hour and again at 24 hr. The scratch area atzero hour and empty area not covered by migrated cells after24 hr was analyzed with ImagePro software. The assay wasrepeated three times. Data points represent the mean6s.d. fromfive fields of uncovered scratch area from three independentexperiments and p,0.05 was considered significant.Cell Invasion assayInvasion assay was performed as per the protocol published byDasgupta et al [27]. MCF7 overexpressing profilin 1 and itsmutant clones were harvested by trypsinization and 16105 cellswere placed in the top chamber of boyden filters as untreated/treated with 200 nM PDBu or a combination of 20 mM LY294002and 200 nM PDBu in serum-free media. The filters were pre-coated with 100 mg/ml ECM (BD Biosciences) and incubated for4 hr at 37uC before adding cells and the assay was performedaccording to the protocol [27]. Invaded cells were stained withhematoxylin and images for 6 different fields per treatment werecaptured using 406magnification using a Leica microscope. Theassay was repeated twice in duplicate and analyzed using two-sided Student\u2019s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d. andp,0.05 was considered significant.Flow cytometryAsynchronously growing MCF7 clones overexpressing profilinand its mutants were treated with hypotonic buffer (1 mg/mlsodium citrate and 0.3% Igepal) for 20 min. The buffer digests thecytoplasm and nuclei detach from the plate. Nuclei are gentlypipetted a few times and collected in an eppendorf for GreenFluorescence acquisition [28]. Similarly, 105cells of each clonewere plated and serum starved for 24 hr. Cells were then treatedwith DMSO control/200 nM PDBu/a combination of 20 mMLY294002 and 200 nM PDBu for 24 hr. Nuclei were harvestedand subjected to flow cytometry for Green Fluorescence acquisi-tion. The data was acquired with flowcytometer (Millipore Guava8 HT easycyte). 50000 events were acquired with flow rate ofFigure 2.

Data was analyzed by FlowJo software. Experimentswere done three times in duplicate.Immunofluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyMCF7 clones (40,000cells) were plated on cover slips (Corning)in a 6-well plate and cultured for 24 hr to visualize localization ofoverexpressed profilin 1 and its mutants. The cells were fixed in2% para-formaldehyde for 15 min. The nuclei were stained withDAPI. Cells were mounted on glass slides.

Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged toremove debris. Samples were concentrated 10times using acentricon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) from 2 ml to 0.2 ml.Zymography was performed as described previously by Toth Met al., [30] with a little modification. Samples were loaded on a10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel incorporated with 0.1% gelatin(Sigma) for electrophoresis. MMP2 and MMP9 zymographicstandards were used as positive controls (Chemicon). Afterelectrophoresis, MMPs were allowed to renature by washing thegel twice in 50 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated for18 hr at 37uC in developing buffer, and stained for 1 hr with 0.5%Coomassie brilliant blue G250. After destaining gelatinolytic activitywas visualized as a transparent band against a blue background. Gelswere imaged using a digital imaging analysis system (Bio-Rad). Theassays were repeated three independent times.Statistical AnalysisAll data was analyzed statistically by two sided student\u2019s t test inMicrosoft Office 2007 and statistical significance was estimated.Densitometric analysis of western blots was carried out withImageJ software. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJosoftware.ResultsHuman breast cancer tissues and primary cells derivedfrom them express high levels of profilin 1Published results on levels of profilin in different cancer tissues/celllines are contradictory. Western blotting analyses was performed onlysates prepared from patient samples for breast cancer and adjacentnormal breast tissues. Profilin 1 levels were significantly higher inbreast cancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal counterparts(Figure 1A). Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealedprofilin 1 was 3.662.5-fold (*p,0.01) elevated in cancer tissues(Figure 1B). Simultaneously, primary epithelial cells were isolatedfrom the same patient samples and lysates were subjected to westernblot analysis for profilin 1. A representative western blot is presentedin Figure 1D and densitometric analysis of the western blots show a1.660.3- fold (*p,0.03) increase in profilin 1 levels in cells isolateddirectly from the breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacentnormal tissues (Figure 1E).Post-translational modification such as phosphorylation canalter the function of cytoskeletal-associated proteins in tumorigen-esis; since profilin 1 is known to undergo phosphorylation atSer137 preferentially by PKCf, an enzyme with potential role inbreast cancer cell chemotaxis and tumor invasion [31\u201333]; we alsoexamined PKCf levels by western blotting in breast cancer andadjacent normal tissues (Figure 1A, middle panel). Figure 1C is adensitometric representation of increased PKCf expression(1.660.5-fold, *p,0.05) in breast cancer tissues. Elevated proteinlevels of PKCf in breast cancer tissues were indicative of aphosphorylation event targeting profilin 1 too. Therefore, westudied the probable role of profilin 1 phosphorylation at serineresidue (S137) in breast cancer.Overexpression of profilin 1-wild type and profilin 1mutants in breast cancer cell line, MCF7Since profilin 1 levels were high in patients with breast cancer,we overexpressed profilin 1 and some of its mutants in MCF7 cellsto study their effect on cancer progression. MCF7 cells weretransfected with each of the following vectors individually: EGFP-N1 (Empty Vector, designated as EV), GFP-Profilin 1-wild type(PFN-WT), GFP-Profilin 1-S137A (mutant for serine 137 phos-phorylation site; PFN-S137A), GFP-Profilin 1-R74E (mutant foractin-binding site, PFN-R74E) and GFP-Profilin 1-H133S (mutantfor poly-L-proline (PLP) sequence binding, PFN-H133S). Expres-sion of profilin clones was studied by confocal microscopy. Leftpanel depicts images of GFP-Profilin and its mutants, middle panelshows DAPI images and right panel shows merged images for eachclone (Figure 2). Each clone showed varying localization of GFP-Profilin. EV expression was observed in the nucleus andcytoplasm. PFN-WT, PFN-S137A and PFN-H133S showedcytoplasmic and nuclear expression. Of these, PFN-H133S waspredominantly cytoplasmic and PFN-R74E was mostly nuclearwith little cytoplasmic expression. These results indicate thatinteraction of profilin with actin is essential to maintain profilin inthe cytoplasm. PFN-H133S showed the least expression of nuclearprofilin suggesting that interaction with PLP-containing proteinscould be essential for its nuclear translocation. Simultaneously,lysates were prepared from MCF7 cells expressing different clonesof profilin and subjected to western blotting with anti-profilinantibodies. EV did not show over-expressed profilin whereas allthe clones showed a band corresponding to GFP-profilin (41 kDa).Endogenous cellular profilin 1 (14 kDa) was observed in all thelanes including EV and actin was used as loading control (42 kDa)(Figure 3A). Next, we determined the nuclear expression alone ofGFP-profilin and mutants in asynchronously growing MCF7 cellsby subjecting them to hypotonic solution that bursts the cytoplasmbut leaves the nuclei intact and detached from the plate. Thenuclei are collected as a single cell suspension and subjected to flowcytometric analysis (Figure 3B). Untransfected MCF7 cells wereused to gate the positive nuclei from the clones. All the clonesshowed similar numbers of nuclei that were positive for profilin 1.Figure 3C\u20133G show the flow cytometry dot plots of GFP-positivenuclei from asynchronously growing EV (96.1%), PFN-WT(85.9%), PFN-S137A (92.8%), PFN-R74E (94.6%) and PFN-H133S (91.3%) respectively. These clones were then selected inneomycin (G418) to obtain a 100% positive polyclonal populationoverexpressing profilin 1 and its mutants respectively.Overexpression of profilin 1 facilitates cell growth andanchorage independent growth that is further enhancedby its phosphorylation at Serine137We first assessed the growth ability of transfected cells in cultureat 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and 7days of plating in complete media byMTT assay (Figure 4A). PFN-WT demonstrated the highestviability at all time points studied followed by PFN-R74E andPFN-H133S. PFN-S137A showed the least growth rate and wascomparable to EV transfected MCF7 cells (***p,0.005). Anchor-age independency is one of the hallmarks of cancer and thisfeature allows tumor cells to invade adjacent tissues and lead tometastasis [34]. To determine which of the profilin 1 mutantsmight interfere with the tumorigenic property of MCF7 cells, softagar assay was performed and colonies above 100 mm wherecounted and plotted. Figure 4B shows representative images ofcolonies in soft agar of different mutants of profilin 1 andfigure 4C is a graphic representation of the average number ofcolonies for each clone from 5 different fields under 2.56magnification. We observed that MCF7 cells expressing PFN-WT formed significantly more and larger colonies in soft agarcompared to EV-expressing MCF7 cells (**p,0.01). PFN-S137Aformed smaller and less number of colonies than EV and 42percent less number of colonies (***p,0.005) than PFN-WT,thereby indicating that (S137) phosphorylation of profilin 1facilitates anchorage independency in breast cancer cells. Actinmutant (PFN-R74E) formed 70 percent more colonies (**p,0.01)than PFN-WT, consistent with previous reports demonstratingPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer ProgressionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868Figure 4.

Defect in PLP binding ability of PFN (PFN-H133S) did not allow any colony formation in soft agar, thoughthe viability of these cells in monolayer cultures was fairlycomparable to PFN-R74E till 72 hr and decreasing by 7days.These results were in corroboration with Wittenmeyer\u2019s study [17]reporting the inability of PFN-H133S to form tumors in mice.Phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 leads to enhancedmigration and invasionWhether phosphorylation of profilin 1 affects migration andinvasion of breast cancer cells expressing various profilin 1 mutantswas next assessed by wound healing assays and boyden chamberassays respectively. PKCf activity can be reduced by thepharmacological inhibitors of PI3K. Previous in vivo studies fromour lab have demonstrated that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu),a protein kinase C activator (PKC), phosphorylates profilin 1 atSerine 137 and the effect is reversed by LY294002, an inhibitor ofPI3K and subsequently PKCf [12,35]. We studied their effect onprofilin 1 mediated migration and invasion. MCF7 cells overex-pressing profilin 1 and its mutants were grown to confluency and ascratch was made with a pipet tip. Images were captured at 206magnification of the scratch at zero hour for each treatment. After24 hr following treatments, images were captured and non-migrated area was analyzed. Figure 5 shows representative imagesof the wound and migrated cells into the wound for all the clones.All clones migrated to some extent into the wound at 24 hr inserum-free media. PDBu induced significant migration in allclones but not in the PFN-S137A mutant clone, thereforedemonstrating that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at Serine 137 isan important event in promoting migration of MCF7 cells. PFN-WT and PFN-R74E expressing cells migrate more than EVexpressing cells upon treatment with PDBu (**p,0.05). Pre-treatment of cells with LY294002 significantly abrogated migra-tion of MCF7 cells overexpressing PFN-WT, PFN-R74E andPFN-H133S (**p,0.05). PFN-S137A did not show much changein migration at 24 hr in either serum-free media or PDBu or LY/PDBu treated cells (***p,0.005) (Figure 6A). This result reinforcesthe fact that serine phosphorylation of profilin 1 facilitatesmigration of breast cancer cells.Similarly, invasion assays using ECM (extracellular matrix)coated boyden chamber filters revealed that PFN-WT and PFN-R74E cells invade more than EV cells in the presence and absenceof PDBu. PFN-R74E showed more invasiveness than PFN-WT(**p,0.05). PFN-H133S invades the least (**p,0.05). However,PDBu- treated PFN-H133S showed 3 times more invasion whencompared to serum-free media, indicating that though PFN-H133S is defective in binding to any PLP containing proteins,phosphorylation at Ser137 made it more aggressive. Pre-treatmentwith LY249002 inhibits invasion of all clones and in fact theinvasiveness is reduced further than serum-free media. PFN-S137A demonstrates significantly reduced invasion even in thepresence of PDBu (**p,0.05) (Figure 6B).Figure 5.

Studies have also beenreported showing colocalization of profilin with MT1-MMP(MMP14) at the leading edges of activated monocytes migratingon a layer of activated endothelial cells [37]. MT1-MMP14, inturn, activates MMP2 and MMP9. In the present study, we makeevident that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 plays a crucialrole in promoting migration and invasion by activating MMP2and MMP9. Conditioned media from clones growing in serum-free media or 200 nM PDBu containing media were subjected tozymography to analyze MMP2 and MMP9 activity. We foundthat serum-free clones produce very low MMP2 only, whereasPDBu-treated cells produced significant amounts of MMP9 and toa certain extent MMP2 also. Among the clones, PFN-WT showedmaximum MMP2/9 activity. PFN-R74E also expressed increasedMMP9 activity comparable to PFN-WT. PFN-H133S by itself wasnot very migratory and invasive in nature but PDBu-treatmentmakes this clone sufficiently pro-invasive. Consistent with thatdata, we found MMP2/9 activity increasing in this clone inresponse to PDBu. PFN-S137A had the least MMP2 activity andremained same under all conditions tested. MMP9 activity inPFN-S137A was comparable to EV and considerably less thanPFN-WT (Figure 7A).Phosphorylation increases translocation of a subset ofprofilin 1 to the nucleusThough profilin 1 has been shown to be localized partially inthe nucleus, very few studies are available on its role in thenucleus. Recent studies carried out in dipteran Chironomas tentanshave shown that a fraction of profilin in located in the nucleus; ishighly concentrated in the nucleoplasm and nuclear periphery. Itassociates with protein-coding transcriptionally active genes and isindependent of actin [38]. Similarly, we observed PFN-WT and itsmutants to be localized in the nucleus, especially PFN-R74E,mutant for actin-binding was predominantly nuclear. We also findthat increasing amounts of profilin localizes to the nucleus uponphosphorylation by PDBu as early as 5 min and upto 18 hr whenFigure 8. Schematic showing various pathways that triggers PI3K activity in breast cancer. These pathways can potentially lead tophosphorylation of profilin 1: (1) Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), (2) Insulin (Ins) and Insulin-like growth factors, (3) Estrogen receptor/Estrogencomplex (ER/E), (4) Growth factors (GF) and (5) Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A) are well known pathways that activate PI3K(Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase) and most common to hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancers. PI3K can in turn activate PKC\u2019s(Protein Kinase C and its isoforms) including PKCf. Among all PKC isoforms, PKCf preferentially phosphorylates profilin 1 on Serine (S137) residue thatleads to enhanced tumorigenic properties in breast cancer cells. VEGF-A can also lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of profilin 1 and increasesangiogenic activity. It can be hypothesized that together these post-translational modifications could be instrumental in breast cancer progression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103868.g008Phosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer ProgressionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868compared to serum starved cells (Figure 7B). PFN-WT showed themost nuclear concentrations of profilin 1 when compared to serumstarved cells. However, PFN-S137A, mutant for phosphorylationat serine 137, did not show any change in profilin localization withor without PDBu (Figure 7B). These results suggest thatphosphorylation of profilin is importing profilin into the nucleusand probably facilitating in the binding of profilin to transcrip-tionally active genes relative to promoting tumorigenesis. Thisobservation will need more confirmatory studies and identificationof nuclear proteins or genes regulated by profilin.DiscussionIn the present study, we report elevated profilin 1 expression innon-metastatic, primary breast carcinoma tissues from Indianpopulation. Profilin levels have been found to be elevated in somepathological states such as adipose tissue inflammation, liver andkidney diseases [39\u201341] though in cancers the reports have beenambiguous. Profilin 1 was found to be downregulated in breastcancer cells CAL51 [16], in pancreatic cancer [42], and inhepatocarcinoma tissues [43] and upregulated in gastric cancer[44]. Analysis of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line for differenti-ation related cytoskeletal proteins also indicated profilin 2 to beelevated in expression [45]. Profilin 1 was identified as a secretedprotein from tumor masses at progressive stage in skin fibromas[46], in oral cancer saliva proteome [47] and also in pancreaticcancer secretome [42]. Whether elevated profilin 1 levels alone areindicative of increased motility and aggressive cancers is debatable.Various cell lines from different cancers behaved differently withoverexpression or abrogation of profilin 1 with respect to cellmigration, invasion and proliferation [16,18,48,49]. Recent studiesreport that profilin 1 is a potential biomarker for bladder canceraggressiveness and suppressing its expression in T24 bladdercancer cell line decreased their motility with a concomitantdecrease in actin polymerization [18]. Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced migration upon overexpression ofprofilin 1 [48], however, an in depth analysis carried out bysilencing profilin 1 showed suppressed endothelial cell prolifera-tion, migration and cord morphogenesis [50]. Likewise studiesinvolving upregulation of profilin showed increased invasivenessand growth of smooth muscle cells [51] and also resulted inglomerular cell proliferation [41]. These observations support thenotion that profilin is directly associated with cell motility,migration and proliferation. Hence the need to investigate thedifferent aspects that regulate profilin\u2019s function in breasttumorigenesis and cancer progression.Earlier studies indicate profilin 19s involvement in cell motilityin the intracellular movement of pathogenic organisms [52] andmigration of lower eukaryotic organisms such as Dictyostelium andListeria [53,54]. It is known that the profilin-actin complex isrecruited at the barbed end of actin filaments at the protrudingend of lamellipodia in migrating cells where actin polymerizationis initiated. Impaired motility of intracellular pathogens wasobserved in profilin-deletion experiments and revealed theimportance of profilin in bacterial motility [52], in migrationand proliferation of lower eukaryotes [53]. Profilin-deficient micewere embryonically lethal and profilin 1 null mice embryos did notsurvive indicating its necessity in cell division and survival duringembryogenesis [55]. Profilins assist F-actin elongation at theleading edge of migrating cells through their interactions with ahost of actin-binding proteins like Ena (enabled)/VASP (vasodi-lator stimulated phosphoprotein) [56,57]. Profilin 1 and profilin 2protein ratios in a cell can also determine the extent of actinpolymerization and cellular motility [7]. Previously known factsinclude that both actin and polyproline interactions of profilin 1are essential for tumorigenesis and enhanced migration/invasion[17,36]. Studies published recently report that phosphorylation ofprofilin at tyrosine 129 in endothelial cells facilitates secretion ofangiocrine factors. These, in turn, stabilize HIF-1a in a hypoxia-independent manner to promote glioblastoma progression [19].Through our studies, we add a new dimension to the role ofprofilin in cell motility, invasion and aggressiveness. Phosphory-lation at Ser137 of profilin 1 confers enhanced motility to MCF7cells by itself irrespective of its actin binding or (PLP) proteinbinding capabilities.Dynamics of profilin\u2019s interactions with its ligands, includingactin polymerization changes upon PTM such as nitration andphosphorylation [12,58]. A number of signaling pathwaystriggered by external factors such as hormones (estrogen) (reviewedin [59]), growth factors (Insulin, Insulin-like growth factors) [60],radiation [61] activate PI3K which is known to activate PKC\u2019sincluding the atypical PKCf and therefore could possibly lead tophosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 (Figure 8). Whether all thesepathways eventually culminate to phosphorylate profilin 1 needsfurther investigation but a probable regulatory loop might beexisting wherein profilin 1 activates PI3K [62] through itsassociation with p85a subunit [63] which in turn increases theproduction of D3 phosphoinositides like PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) knownto activate PKC\u2019s and Akt pathway. PKC\u2019s trigger survival,motility and breast cancer progression (reviewed in [64]). Wefound PKC elevated in the breast cancer samples and anotherstudy found increased PI3K levels in breast cancers [65] indicatingthat profilin 1 phosphorylation could be an obligatory signalingevent in promoting breast tumorigenesis. ROCK (Rho-associatedKinase) and PP1 (Protein phosphatase 1) are also known toregulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of profilin 1 atSer137 [25]. Multiple kinases affect profilin phosphorylationthereby increasing the complexity in the nature of profilin 19sfunction; its interactions with its many isoforms and oligomers[35]. These in turn will affect the cascade of proteininteractions further and the biological consequences thereafter.From our studies in breast cancer cells using serine phosphor-ylation mutant of profilin (PFN-S137A), it is evident thatprofilin phosphorylation is crucial in promoting tumorigenesis.PFN-S137A overexpressing cells also showed significantlyreduced growth, migration, invasion and colony formationcompared to PFN-WT.MMP9-mediated gelatin matrix degradation showed substan-tially higher expression in PDBu-stimulated breast cancer cellsexpressing PFN and its mutants studied. MMP2-mediated gelatindegradation was relatively lower than MMP9 in PDBu-stimulatedcells. MT1-MMP (MMP14) has been shown to colocalize withprofilin in monocytes at leading edges [37]. It is well known thatMT1-MMP self-activates and in turn activates MMP2 and MMP9also. Together these are involved in degrading extracellular matrixand making cells more motile and invasive. PFN-S137A express-ing cells demonstrated least activity of MMP9 and MMP2 therebysuggesting that profilin phosphorylation is in part associated withactivating MMPs, consecutively facilitating cellular mobility.PDBu can stimulate MMP14 and inhibiting PKCf could reducerecruitment of MMP9 to podosomes and its release and activation[66]. The coordinated action of PI3K, PKC and profilinphosphorylation to induce MMPs needs further investigation tocharacterize the sequence of events in breast cancer progression.Another interesting finding was phosphoprofilin\u2019s translocation tothe nucleus that requires in-depth analysis focusing on the functionof profilin in the nucleus and subsequent role in breast cancerprogression. Very little information is available on nuclearPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer ProgressionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868profilin\u2019s role in mammalian cells. Both cytoplasmic and nucleardistribution of profilin has been observed in cultured mammaliancells [67,68]. Recent evidence from Skare et al. [69] suggests thatprofilin-actin complexes may play a role in pre-mRNA processingwithin the nucleus, due to extensive co-localization of profilin withthe small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-associated Smproteins and Cajal bodies. It is believed that mammalianembryogenesis requires nuclear and cytoplasmic profilin tomaintain normal embryo development by interacting with actin-related proteins such as Arp 3, VASP, Dia1 and p80 coilin [70]. Itwould be interesting to demonstrate the importance of nuclearprofilin and nuclear phosphoprofilin in breast cancer progressionand targeting profilin 1 phosphorylation for cancer therapy couldbe a prudent option.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Jieya Shao, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri forthe generous gift of pcDNA3.PFN.S137A vector and Dr. Partha Roy,University of Pittsburg, PA for gifting actin and PLP mutants of profilin.We appreciate the help of technical staff, Central Facilities for Researchand Development, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: WR SSS.
