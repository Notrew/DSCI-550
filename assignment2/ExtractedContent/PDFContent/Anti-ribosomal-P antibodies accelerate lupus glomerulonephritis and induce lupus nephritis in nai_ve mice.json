All rights reserved.a b s t r a c tBackground: Lupus nephritis is known to be associated with several antibodies including autoantibodiesthat target the DNA, C1q and histone, a-actinin, and the nucleosome. In addition, circulating anti-phosphoribosomal protein antibodies (anti-Ribos.P) were found to be associated with lupus nephritis.Study objective: We have assessed the direct role of anti-Ribos.P in the development of glomerulone-phritis in-vitro and in animal models.Study design: NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice were immunized with recombinant Ribos.P0 (rRibos.P).Evaluation of renal disease included mice evaluation for proteinuria and histologic analysis of the kidneys.Anti-Ribos.P monoclonal Ab was prepared from the rRibos.P immunized NZBxW/F1 mice by hybridomatechnology. MAPKs expression was analyzed by MAPKs protein array and confirmed by real-time PCR andwestern blot. To elucidate whether anti-Ribos.P induce glomerulonephritis, na\u00efve C3H mice wereimmunized with recombinant rRibos.P and the glomerulonephritis was followed up as described above.Results: The immunized NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice developed anti-Ribos.P which was cross reactivewith Sm and not dsDNA. The mice developed accelerated glomerulonephritis manifested by early pro-teinuria and immunoglobulin deposites in the mesangium of the kidneys. Anti-Ribos.P deposited in theglomerular mesangium were eluted from the kidney. The Ribos.P immunized na\u00efve C3H/Hen micedeveloped glomerulonephritis manifested by circulating autoantibodies directed to Ribos.P, dsDNA andSm. The anti Ribos.P were cross reactive with Sm but not with dsDNA, and were deposited in theglomeruli. Interestingly these mice developed alopecia. In vitro. Primary mesangial cells exposed tomouse anti-Ribos.P mAb originated from the immunized lupus mice and to human anti-Ribos.P Abs,induced activation of mesangial cells via p38a, JNK, AKT and HSP27 MAPKs expression pathway.Conclusions: Our data show for the first time that anti-Ribos.P are nephritogenic autoantibodies, asillustrated by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments: a) They accelerate the development of glomerulone-phritis in lupus prone mice; b) They induce nephritis in na\u00efve mice. c) Anti-Ribos.P Abs trigger MAPKsexpression in primary mesangial cells. These data contribute a direct mechanistic link between anti-Ribos.P and nephritis in lupus mice.\ufffd 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionAmong the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE), nephritis occurs in 40e60% of SLEutoimmune Diseases, Sheba2 3 5308070.ank), shoenfel@post.tau.ac.ilaper.patients. Because lupus nephritis progress into renal failure, it is aprincipal cause of death among SLE patients [1]. Glomerulone-phritis classification in SLE according to the World HealthOrganization (WHO) comprises six histological classes. The Inter-national Society of Nephrology (ISN) and the Renal Pathology So-ciety (RPS), have published a newer, similar classification with theaddition of \u201ca\u201d for active and \u201cc\u201d for chronic changes. The advantageof the ISN/RPS classification is that it supplies the informationregarding the potential reversibility of the disease [2].

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 119and augmentation of local inflammatory responses, including thedeposition of immunoglobulins within the glomerular and tubularbasement membranes [3]. The lupus nephritis enigma for severaldecades. In the late 1960s, using immunofluorescence, Koffler et al.showed that immune complexes are involved in lupus nephritispathogenesis and they found anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in thekidneys of patients who presented with lupus nephritis [4].Lupus nephritis is known to be associated with several anti-bodies, including autoantibodies that target the DNA (4), C1q andhistone, a-actinin [5e7], and the nucleosome [8]. dsDNA reactiveantibodies are believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis oflupus nephritis through three main mechanisms: a) tissue damagedue to the in-vitro mesangial cell penetration of anti-dsDNA anti-bodies which cross react with kidney antigens; b) the formation ofanti-dsDNA antibodies immune complexes with DNA/nucleosomes,which are released from apoptotic cells; and c) in situ formation ofanti-dsDNA antibodies and nucleosomes immune complexes [6,9].Additionally, in a more recent study, researchers were able to showthat glomerular inflammation induction is strongly related to thedirect binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to antigens in the glomer-ular basement membrane or mesangial matrix [10].In 1965, Sturgill and Carpenter [11] were the first to identifyanti-Ribos.P Abs which target the intracellular ribosomal phos-phoprotein. Anti-Ribos.P Abs bind to three main ribosomal pro-teins: P0, P1 and P2 (38 kd, 19 kd and 17 kd), respectively [12].These antibodies targets mainly the22 amino acids region, which islocated at the carboxyl terminal end (C-22) of the ribosomal S60subunit, This complex includes two copies each of P1 and P2 and asingle copy of P0. The interaction of the pentameric complex withthe 28S rRNA molecule, creates the GTPase domain, which in turnplays a part in the elongation process of protein translation [13].Among lupus patients, the reported prevalence of anti-Ribos.PAbs is 10e40%, with a high specificity of the Abs with neuropsy-chiatric SLE (NPSLE) [14,15]. Correlations between anti-Ribos.P Absand neuropsychiatric clinical expressions include psychosis,delirium, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and anxiety [16].Additionally, intracerebroventricular administration of humananti-Ribos.P induced depression in na\u00efve mice [17].A link between anti-Ribos.P autoantibodies and nephritis,hepatitis and skin manifestations in lupus patients was reportedpreviously [18,19]. Anti-Ribos.P Abs have high specificity for SLE[20] with clear correlation to SLE disease activity. Moreover, thepresence of these Abs was more prevalent in patients in whichSLE appeared during adolescence compared to patients in whomthe disease developed at a later age [21].Meroni PL et al. first reported the association between anti-Ribos.P Abs and renal injury in patients with lupus in 1984 [22]Reichlin\u2019s group showed that in patients demonstrating anti-Ribos.P Abs, lupus nephritis was significantly more prevalent thanin those who were negative for these Abs [23]. This group alsodemonstrated anti-Ribos.P Abs titer fluctuations, based on exacer-bation and remission intervals of the disease [24]. Several anotherstudies further showed that the simultaneous expression of anti-dsDNA Abs and anti-Ribos.P strongly correlate with lupusnephritis [21,25,26]. Furthermore, Bonfa et al. [27] proposed thatanti-Ribos-P Abs may have a potential serologic marker for mem-branous glomerulonephritis (class V) in SLE patients, while deMacedo et al. [28] suggested that during nephritis flares, in theabsence of anti-dsDNA, anti-Ribos.P Abs predict a better renalprognosis. Another group showed a high (but not significant) co-predominance in lupus nephritis class IV and V of anti-dsDNAAbs and anti-Ribos.P [29]. However, others showed no correlationbetween lupus nephritis and anti-Ribos.P Abs [30,31].In our study, we report that anti-Ribos.P accelerate lupusnephritis in lupus prone mice and de novo induction of anti-Ribos.P Abs cause renal injury and lupus skin manifestations.We demonstrate the ability of anti-Ribos.P mAbs to bindmesangial cells and induce MAPKs, which can serve as animportant mechanism for mediating renal tissue injury.2. Materials and methods2.1. AntibodiesThe following Abs were used in these studies:Human anti-Ribos.P IgG Abs were affinity purified on aribosomal-P column from sera originated from a patient withNPSLE accompanied with nephritis as previously described [32].Control human IgG (h.cIgG) or mouse Ig1 were of commercialorigin (m.cIgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., WestGrove, PA, USA)).Generation of mouse anti-Ribos. mAbs: The mouse anti-Ribos.PmAbs were prepared as previously described by us (33). Spleencells were isolated form three NZBxW/F1 rRibos.P immunized, 3months after the boost. The splenocytes were fusedwith themouseplasmacytoma cell line \ufffd63.653 at a ratio of 10:1 in the presence ofPEG (polyethylene glycol) 1500, and seeded in 96 wells in HATmedium using standard techniques as previously described by us[33]. The positive clones were subjected three times to a limitingdilution procedure. The anti-Ribos.P specific mAb detection wasperformed by screening culture fluids on Ribos.P coated plates(AESKU) by ELISA, and on ELISA plates coated with synthetic pep-tide RIBOSPEP 50 mg/ml in PBS overnight at 4 \ufffdC. ScrambledRIBOSPEP peptide coated ELISA plates were used as control. Theplates were blocked with 3%BSA in PBS 1 h at 37C. Following4 h incubation time with the tested culture fluid, the immuno-globulin binding was probed with a goat-anti-mouse IgG-alkaline-phosphatase and later the appropriate substrate was added. Datawere read at OD 405 nm ref.650 nm. The selected mouse anti-Ribos.P mAb M7/3 IgG1 bound specifically to Ribos.P in a dosedependent manner and the RIBOSPEP synthetic peptide (carboxy-terminal 22-amino acid of the ribosome.P as described below) wasable to inhibit M7/3 mAb binding to Ribos.P by 97 \ufffd 8% at a con-centration of 12 mg/ml in comparison to 3 \ufffd 2% in the presence ofscRIBOPEP, P < 0.001 (Fig. 1).Commercial mouse IgG1 isotype(cmIgG) (Jackson) was used as negative control.Generation of mouse anti-anti-Ribos. mAbs: C3H mice wereimmunized with Ribos.P in CFA, The mice were boosted twice with2 weeks intervals with Ribos.P in incomplete Freuds adjuvant. Twoweeks later the mice developed high titers of anti-anti-Ribos.P. IgG.The sera was loaded on anti-Ribos.P mAb column and the elutedIgG was anti-anti-Ribos.P IgG.2.2. Synthetic peptidesThe synthetic peptide is composed of the carboxy-terminal 22-amino acid of the ribosome-P protein and has the followingsequence: Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp-Met-Gly-Phe-Gly-Phe-Leu-Phe-OH named RIBO-SPEP. The control scrambled form of this peptide is: Met-Lys-Glu-Lys-Glu-Glu-Ser-Lys-Phe-Asp-Gly-Glu-Asp-Glu-Glu-Leu-Phe -Glu-Phe-Lys-Gly-Glu-OH. The peptides were synthesized by GL-Biochem, Shanghai Ltd, Shanghai, China.2.3. ImmunizationFemale NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice at 12 weeks of age wereobtained from The Harlan Laboratories (Bicester, UK). Female C3H/Hen mice at 12 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Labo-ratories (Rehovot, Israel). Mice were handled under protocolsFig. 1.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126120approved by the Sheba Medical Center Animal Care and The IsraelMinistry of Health Committee according to internationalguidelines.NZBxW/F1 and C3H/Hen mice were immunized with recombi-nant ribosomal-P0 (rRibos.P0)(AESKU, Wendelsheim, Germany),10 mg/0.1 ml/mouse emulsion in Complete Freunds\u2019 Adjuvant (CFA)into the hind footpads. Three weeks later a booster injection wasgiven in PBS at the same location. NZBxW/F1 (n \u00bc 20) mice wereimmunized with rRibos.P at the age of 12 weeks, boosted at the ageof 15 weeks. Five mice were immunized with CFA and one group ofNZBxW/F1 mice were not immunized. The C3H/Hen (n \u00bc 20) micewere immunized at the age of 12 weeks using the same protocoland boosted at 15 weeks. C3H/Hen mice (n \u00bc 20) were immunizedwith CFA.2.4. Detection of autoantibodies in mice seraMouse anti-dsDNA: Anti-dsDNA Abs binding in the mice serawere detected by home-made ELISA as previously described by us[34]. Briefly, mice sera diluted 1:200 were applied to the dsDNAcoated ELISA plates, incubated for 60 min at room temperature.Bound antibodies were probed by using alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H \u00fe L) (Jackson) diluted 1:5000followed by appropriate substrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Datawere read by a Titertrek ELISA reader at 405 nm filter/620 nmreference filter.Mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs were evaluated in the mice sera byemploying Anti-ribos.P kits (AESKU). Mice sera at a dilution of1:200 were added to the dilution buffer for 30 min at room tem-perature. The binding was probed with a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase (Jackson) at a dilution 1:10,000, followed by an appro-priate substrate according to the manufacturer instructions. Thedata were read at OD of 450 nm.Mouse anti-Sm Abs were evaluated in the mice sera by usingELISA coated and blocked Sm plates (INOVA, Diagnostic Inc. San-Diego, CA, USA) as described above for anti-Ribos.P.Inhibition assays: Mouse anti-dsDNA Abs were affinity purifiedfrom sera of NZBxW/F1 mice and C3H/Hen mice, immunized withrRibos.P, on a cellulose column as previously described by us (34).Inhibition assays were performed using affinity purified anti-dsDNA Abs, IgG from NZBxW/F1 mice immunized with Ribos.P,after depletion of anti-dsDNA on a cellulose column, followed byprotein affinity purification and anti-Ribos.P mAb, all at 50% bind-ing to the specific plate. dsDNA, and Ribosomal-P were used asinhibitors at different concentrations (5e50 mg/ml), for dsDNAbinding and Sm/RNP binding by ELISA.2.5. Evaluation of renal diseaseMice were evaluated for proteinuria using Multistix strips(Bayer Diagnostics, Puteau, France). Urine samples were graded 0e4\u00fe, corresponding to the following approximate protein concen-trations: 0 \u00bc negative or trace, 30 mg/dl, 100 mg/dl, 300 mg/dl and\ufffd2000 mg/dl. Mice with a significant proteinuria (\ufffd300) on twoconsecutive examinations were designated positive for renal dis-ease. Severely ill and wasted mice with a significant proteinuriawere sacrificed when they appeared moribund. These mice wereconsidered as dead at the time they were killed and were includedin the survival evaluation.Histologic analysis of the kidneys: Mice perfused with PBS wereparaffin embedded. Five micron sections were stained for H&E. Fordetection of Ig deposits, paraffin sections (4e5 mm) were incubatedwith ananti-mouse Fc IgG FITC-conjugated (Jackson). Evaluationwasperformed by two pathologists that were blinded to the diagnosis.2.6. Immunoglobulin elution from the kidneysLysate from the kidneys were prepared following perfusionwithPBS. The kidneys were homogenized with Glycine-HCl O.2M pH2.5.The eluate was dialyzed against PBS. Anti-ribos.P binding wasdetected by ELISA.2.7. Preparation of primary mouse mesangial cells (MCs)MCs from C3H/Hen mice kidneys were isolated according to aprotocol described by Deocharan B et al. [7]. The outer cortexes ofD. Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 12110 kidneys were minced with a razor, and the tissue was forcedthrough progressively smaller stainless steel sieves (180, 150, and90 mm, Sigma). Glomeruli were then caught on a 75-mm sieve,washed twice with PBS, and centrifuged for 5 min at 220 g. Thewashed glomeruli were treatedwith collagenase for 20min at 24 \ufffdCand washed again as above. Cells were plated out in RPMI 1640supplemented with non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate,insulin, and 20% FCS, and maintained at 37 \ufffdC/5% CO2. The mediawas changed every 4 days. After 30 days, the cultures consist ofvirtually pure MCs.2.8. MCs Treatments, lysate preparation, immunoblotting and real-time-PCRMCs derived from C3H mice kidneys, were exposed to humananti-Ribos.P Abs, mouse anti-Ribos.P mAbs control human IgG andcontrol mouse IgG1 isotype control (20 mg/ml) for 4 h. Subse-quently, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5),1%SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 0.2 mM PMSF, all the re-agents were purchased from Sigma), incubated 30 min at 4 \ufffdC, andcentrifuged to remove debris. The protein content of the lysate wasmeasured using the BCA\ufffd protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific,Rockford, IL, USA). Phospho-MAPKs membrane arrays (R&D Sys-tems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were exposed to the differentlysates originated from MCs exposed to anti-Ribos.P Abs and therelevant controls, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol [35].Total mRNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA isolation kitaccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNAwas then reversetranscribed into cDNA by MMLV reverse transcriptase. Five micro-grams of total RNA was transcribed to cDNA in a 30-ml reactionvolume. For transcript quantification by real-time PCR, the SYBRGreen Mix containing Thermo-Start DNA Polymerase (InVitroGene,CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.cDNA samples were amplified using specific primers. PCR amplifi-cationwas performedwith specific forward and reverse primers forp38a (forward, 50-58GTGCCCGAGCGTTACCAGACC78-30; reverse,50-370CTGTAAGCTTCTGACATTTC351-30), The levels of p38a mRNAwere adjusted to the levels of aactin. a5\u2019 e primer (50- TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGTA-AAG-30) and 30 e primer (50- CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAGG e 30). aactine primers were asTable 1Percent inhibition of binding of affinity purified anti-dsDNA, mouse-IgG depleted of antiELISARibos.P SmTested Ab: Anti-dsDNA bIgG, antidsDNAdepletedAnti-Ribos.PmAbAnti-dsDNAInhibitor: dsDNA Ribos.P Ribos.P dsDNA Ribos.P Ribos.PConcentration mg/ml 50 50 50 50NZBxW/F1 immunizedwith Ribos.P1a 3c 4 98 \ufffd 5 4 \ufffd 2 97 \ufffd 4 152 5 2 95 \ufffd 3 93 4 3 99 \ufffd 7 114 6 5 97 \ufffd 9 145 2 4 98 \ufffd 4 12C3H/Hen immunizedwith Ribos.P1 2 9 96 \ufffd 6 162 6 8 98 \ufffd 4 123 7 10 96 \ufffd 5 94 11 6 99 \ufffd 7 175 8 7 97 \ufffd 9 11Control IgG inhibition of binding by specific antigen to: Ribos.P e 8 \ufffd 2; Sm e 5 \ufffd 2; dsa Mouse number from which IgG was purified.

Results3.1. rRibos.P0 NZBxW/F1 immunized mice developed acceleratedglomerulonephritisWe studied the potential of de-novo generated mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs by immunizing NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice withrRibos.P0, on the development of glomerulonephritis. We analyzedthe titers of autoantibodies, proteinuria, immunoglobulin deposi-tion in the glomeruli and we eluted mouse anti-Ribos.P0 from thekidneys of the rRibos.P0 immunized mice. NZBxW/F1 lupus pronemice, immunized with rRibos.P0, developed an earlier glomerulo-nephritis than the adjuvant immunized mice week 18e22 incomparison to the adjuvant injected mice which developedglomerulonephritis at week 32e34. These mice developed hightiters of anti-Ribos.P Abs which remained steadily high until thetimewhen the mice developed glomerulonephritis, at the age of 34weeks (Fig. 1a), P < 0.001. The data were confirmed by an immu-noblot (Fig. 1b). Whereas the CFA immunized mice, did not developanti-Ribos.P Abs. However, the titers of anti-dsDNA Abs in the serawere elevated in both, in the rRibos.P0 and the CFA immunizedmice (Fig. 1c). The titers of anti-dsDNA were not affected by theimmunization procedure with rRibos.P, p > 0.05, (Fig. 1c).As depicted in Table 1, anti-Ribos.P Abs were not cross reactivewith dsDNA since anti-dsDNA affinity purified from the sera ofNZBxW/F1 mice, did not bind Ribos.P ELISA plate and was notinhibited by Ribos.P on dsDNA ELISA plate. Moreover, the datawereconfirmed by using anti-Ribos.P mAb derived from these mice. Theanti-Ribos.P mAb binding to Ribos.P was not inhibited by dsDNAand no anti-dsDNA binding was observed (Table 1).Interestingly, across reactivity between Ribos.P and Sm antigen was detected(Table 1).Anti-Sm binding was tested by using polyclonal IgG fromthe lupus mice which were anti-dsDNA depleted, anti-Ribos.P mAb,and Ribos.P as inhibitor. The data show that Ribos.P inhibited anti-Ribos.P binding by 40%. p < 0.004.-dsDNA and anti-Ribos.P mAb to dsDNA, Ribos.P and Sm by ELISA.dsDNAIgGanti-dsDNAdepletedAnti-Ribos.PmAbAnti-dsDNA IgGanti-dsDNAdepletedAnti-Ribos.PmAbRibos.P dsDNA Ribos.P dsDNA Ribos.P Ribos.P dsDNA Ribos.P50 50 50 50 5045 \ufffd 3 7 \ufffd 2 47 \ufffd 4 97 3 6 \ufffd 1 5 \ufffd 2 3 \ufffd 136 \ufffd 4 99 5 7 \ufffd 154 \ufffd 6 98 6 8 \ufffd 739 \ufffd 4 96 4 9 \ufffd 245 \ufffd 3 95 5 7 \ufffd 349 \ufffd 4 99 6 8 \ufffd 352 \ufffd 5 97 8 9 \ufffd 257 \ufffd 6 98 6 6 \ufffd 246 \ufffd 5 95 9 7 \ufffd 353 \ufffd 5 99 7 8 \ufffd 2DNA e 11 \ufffd 3.purified from sera pooled from 2 mice.cellulose column, followed by protein affinity purification.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126122Given that the titers of circulating anti-Ribos.P were elevated inthe rRibos.P0 immunized mice, we assessed the deposition of theseAbs in the kidneys. Mouse anti-Ribos.P IgGAbs were extracted fromthe kidneys of rRibos.P0 immunized mice. The immunoglobulinextracted from the kidneys of the rRibos.P immunized mice incomparison to the adjuvant immunized mice were analyzed foranti-Ribos.P binding by ELISA. The data revealed 1.065 \ufffd 0.112 ODat 405 nm for the Ig extracted from rRibos.P immunized micekidneys in comparison to 0.213 \ufffd 0.087 for the Ig extracted fromthe CFA immunized kidneys. Yet, a direct confirmation for thenephritogenic activity of anti-Ribos.P in the development ofglomerulonephritis was needed. Therefore, we have generated amouse anti-Ribos.P0 mAb from the splenocytes of NZBxW/F1 rRi-bos.P0 immunized mouse. The anti-Ribos.P0 mAb recognized asynthetic peptide composed of the carboxy-terminal 22-amino acidof the ribosome-P protein (RIBOSPEP) by ELISA. As illustrated inFig. 2, the RIBOSPEP inhibited the binding of anti-Ribos.P mAb torRibos.P0 by 98.4 \ufffd 7.1% at the concentration of 10 mg/ml, whereasFig. 3.

TherRibos.P0 immunized group of mice, showed a higher percentage ofmice having >100 mg/dl proteinuria (40% at week 20, 60% at week24) in comparison with the CFA immunized mice (1% at week 20and 59% at week 24).At the age of 18 weeks (3 weeks after boostadministration), Ribos.P0 immunized mice already began todevelop proteinuria whereas the control mice did not (Fig. 3a). Asshown in Fig. 3b, renal histopathology at week 24 of age, revealedtypical findings of focal and diffuse proliferative damage inglomerulus shown by H&E staining. Immunofluorescence stainingillustrate immunoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli with diffusepattern of diffuse peripheral deposition (Fig. 3b). Whereas, nosignificant immunoglobulin deposition in the glomeruli wasobserved in the kidneys of adjuvant immunized mice or in the non-immunized mice of the same age.3.2. Na\u00efve mice immunized with rRibos.P0, developedglomerulonephritis and experimental lupusWe immunized C3H/Hen female mice with rRibos.P0 emulsifiedin CFA as an adjuvant. One-month after booster administration, therRibos.P0 immunized mice developed significantly elevated titersof circulating anti-Ribos.P0 Abs (p < 0.001), when compared tocontrol CFA immunized mice (Fig. 4a). In addition, the micedeveloped high levels of circulating anti-dsDNA Abs whichremained constant over the time as depicted in Fig. 4b. Elevatedanti-Sm Abs were shown in the rRibos.P0 injected mice (Fig. 4c). Asshown in Table 1, anti-Ribos.P Abs were not cross reactive withdsDNA since anti-dsDNA affinity purified from the sera of C3H/Henmice, did not bind Ribos.P and were not inhibited by Ribos.P ondsDNA ELISA plate. However, a cross reactivity between anti-Ribos.P and Sm antigen was illustrated (Table 1). Polyclonal IgGanti-dsDNA depleted binding to Sm ELISA plates was inhibited byRibos.P (46% up to 57% inhibition), p < 0.01. Clinically, all the rRi-bos.P0 injected mice exhibited proteinuria at 4 months after thebooster administration (e.g 100 mg/dl) whereas the CFA injectedmice did not develop proteinuria (0e30 mg/dl). Renal histopa-thology at 4 months after boost injection revealed a diffuse. 3a: Percent of mice with proteinuria above 100 mg/dl.

Furthermore, anti-Ribos.P0 waseluted from the kidney. Analyses of the immunoglobulins elutedfrom the kidneys,showed elevated anti-Ribos.P0 activity by ELISA(OD of 0.893 \ufffd 0.078 in comparison to OD of 0.0930 \ufffd 0.03 in thelysate of kidneys from the CFA injected mice).In addition all the C3H/Hen immunized mice with rRibos.Pdeveloped alopecia on their face (a well-known skin manifestationof lupus), whereas control mice did not (Fig. 5b).3.3. Anti-Ribos.P activate p38 MAPK in mesangial cells in-vitroMouse mesangial cell cultures prepared from healthy C3H/Henfemale kidneys. In order to follow the effect of anti-Ribos.P onmesangial cells signaling cascade, a lysate from the mesangial cellswas introduced to protein MAPKs protein array. The mesangial cellcultures were pre-exposed for 24 h to mouse anti-Ribos.P mAb andits IgG1 control or to a human anti-Ribos.P IgG and its IgG control.As shown in Fig. 6a, anti-Ribos.P originated either from humanlupus patient or from a mouse origin, enhanced significantly theexpression of phosphorylated p38a P < 0.001 by densitometry andHSP27, p < 0.02 in densitometry. Furthermore, as described inFig. 6b, the expression of p-p38 was confirmed in the level of mRNAby real time PCR, p < 0.004 for human anti-Ribos.P and p < 0.01 fora mouse anti-rRibos.P in comparison to the relevant controlimmunoglobulin. The data were confirmed by immunoblot, Fig. 6c.The immunoblot analyses demonstrated that anti-Ribos.P frommouse and human origins, as well as anti-dsDNA IgG affinity pu-rified from the lupus mice, enhanced the expression of p-p38,whereas anti-anti-Ribos.P inhibited the anti-Ribos.P effect on themesangial cells, which confirm the specificity of the p38 activationby anti-Ribos.P Abs.4. DiscussionIn the present study we demonstrated that recombinantRibos.P0 (38 kD) immunized NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice, devel-oped mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs, which did not target dsDNA andshare specificity with Sm antigen by 40%. Accelerated proteinuriawas detected in the Ribos.P immunized mice associated with renalhistopathology at week 24 of age revealed focal and diffuse pro-liferative damage in glomeruli with a diffuse peripheral depositiondemonstrated by immunofluorescence. Non-significant immuno-globulin deposition was observed in the CFA adjuvant immunizedmice or non-immunized mice at the same age of 24 weeks. Thedirect nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P was approved by a)rRibos.P immunized mice developed accelerated glomerulone-phritis. Mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs were detected in the kidneys fromthe NZBxW/F1mice .b) Anti-Ribos.P mAb originated from rRibos.P0immunized NZBxW/F1 did not bind dsDNA,share specificity withSm antigen. Anti-Ribos.P Abs from mouse and human origin acti-vate the phosphorylation of p38a and HSP27 MAPKs. c) C3H/Henna\u00efve mice immunized with rRibos.P0 developed high levels ofcirculating anti-Ribos.P, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm/RNP Abs. Theanti-Ribos.P Abs did not bind dsDNA but were cross reactive withSm antigen. The profile of circulating autoantibodies was associatedwith sever glomerulonephritis that was illustrated by proteinuriaand diffuse proliferative mesangial damage with diffuse peripheraldeposition. All C3H/Hen immunized mice with rRibos.P developedalopecia. Control mice did not develop either circulating autoanti-bodies nor nephritis or alopecia.The MAPKs cascade is involved in many pathways of immuneresponses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and celldeath. One of the three major groups of MAPKs in mammalian cellsis the p38 MAPK. It is now well recognized that there are multipleFig. 5.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126124mechanisms of p38 activation. In the classical conserved cascade,MAP K 3 (MKK3), MKK4, and MKK6 activates p38 MAPK by a dualphosphorylation at the tripeptide motif Thr-Gly-Tyr [43,44]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulate inflammatory pathways, ending inthe activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and activating protein-1(AP-1). p38 MAPK plays essential roles in mediating AP-1 activa-tion in TLR signaling [45]. It was suggested that MAPs are involvedin the development of renal injury and have an important role inthe pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. p38 MAPK is being acti-vated in normal human kidney and its activation is significantlyincreased in class III and IV lupus glomerulonephritis and ANCA-positive pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Activationof p38 MAPK in renal cells correlates with the degree of interstitialinflammation [46]. The expression of vascular cell adhesionmolecule-1 (VCAM-1) in human mesangial cells leads to recruit-ment of leukocytes and monocytes adhesion to the glomerularmesangium. This is mediated, at least partially, by activation of p38MAPK [47]. Moreover, studies show that p38 MAP K inhibitors havefavorable effects by reducing glomerular infiltration and prolifera-tion [48,40]. Inhibition of p38 MAPK reduce glomerular macro-phage accumulation and crescent formation in vivo, and decreaseanti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies(ANCA)-activation ofneutrophils in vitro [49]. The specific deposition and concentrationof anti-Ribos.P at the site of tissue injury was previously demon-strated by Reichlin\u2019s group, as they discovered a 30-fold enrich-ment of anti-Ribos.P activity in the renal eluate from a patient withlupus nephritis [50]. In our study, human and mouse originatedanti-Ribos.P activatedmesangial cells in-vitro, resulting in p38a andHSP27 phosphorylation. This finding confirms the pathogenic roleof anti-Ribos.P autoantibodies.Our data contribute additional target epitope to the muliepitopenetwork of lupus related autoantibodies related to the mesangiumin lupus. There are several autoantibodies which cross react withdsDNA such as actinin and annexin-II, which also activate mesan-gial cells via p38 [51,52].SLE has a wide range of clinical manifestations and lupusnephritis is a principal cause of death [1]. The currently usedclassification of lupus nephritis includes 6 histologic classes asdiagnosed by kidney biopsy [3]. During exacerbation of lupusnephritis there is an increase in titer of anti dsDNA autoantibodiesand formation of immune complex. Recurrent inflammation causeeventually mesangial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [4].The nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P in the currenetstudy goes along with the previously suggested mechanismswhich encompass the following: a) Anti-ribos.P Abs-mediatedtissue injury. Ribos.P proteins are expressed as intracellular anti-gens and also as antigens that are displayed on the cell surfaces ofdifferent tissues and numerous types of cells, including mesangialcells, astrocytes, neuroblastoma cells, hepatoma cells and fibro-blasts [32,36,37,39]. For example, anti-Ribos.P target and penetrateintracellular Jurkat T cells followed by apoptotic cell-death process[38]. Anti-Ribos.P penetrateinot HepG2 hepatocytes in-vitro andcause damage apolipoprotein B synthesis, resulting in tripling ofthe amount of intra-cell cholesterol and lipid droplets (andthereby consistent with what is seen in various chronic liver dis-eases) [32]. b) Anti-ribos.P Abs substantially inhibit the overalllevel of protein synthesis in-vitro, (as measured by methionineincorporation [35S]) [32,40]. c) Anti-Ribos.P Abs bind a neuronalsurface and are capable of inducing in vivo and in vitro apoptosis inneurons, following the flow of calcium into cells [41]. d) Anti-Ribos.P may interfere with Th17 responses as a result of theiractivation of the p38 MAPK, as it was shown that the p38a acted inDCs to regulate IL-6 and IL-27 and to initiate Th17 differentiationand autoimmune inflammation [42].Fig. 6. In-vitro MAPKs analyses in primary mesangial cells culture upon exposureto anti-Ribos.P human or mouse mAb and controls IgG. 6a: MAPKs expression bymouse mesangial cells preexposed to human anti-Ribos.P or mouse anti-Ribos.P mAband control human and mouse IgG1, for 1 h. 6b: Relative expression of p38a (real-timePCR) by mesangial cells preexposed to human anti-Ribos.P or mouse anti-Ribos.P mAband control human and mouse IgG1, for 1 h. 6c: Immunoblot analysis of mesangialcells preincubated with anti-Ribo.P \ufffd anti-anti-Ribos.P and control IgG.D. Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 125Finally, the association of glomerulonephritis and elevated titersof anti-Ribos.P Abs in lupus patients was previously reported byseveral groups [22,23,27]. Our findings demonstrate for the firsttime the direct nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P autoanti-bodies and their role in the development of glomerulonephritis inexperimental model. In lupus As reported by Bonfa et al. Implica-tion to human: anti-Ribos.P can be considered as a biomarker forlupus nephritis in the sera.Conflict of interestWe certify that there is no conflict of interest with any financialorganization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.References[1] Berden JH, Licht R, van Bruggen MC, Tax WJ.
