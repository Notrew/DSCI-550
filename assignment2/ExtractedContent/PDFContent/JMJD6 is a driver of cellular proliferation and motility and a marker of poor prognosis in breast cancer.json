"JMJD6 is a driver of cellular proliferation and motility and a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancerRESEARCH ARTICLE Open AccessJMJD6 is a driver of cellular proliferation andmotility and a marker of poor prognosis inbreast cancerYi Fang Lee1, Lance David Miller2, Xiu Bin Chan1, Michael A Black6, Brendan Pang3, Chee Wee Ong3,Manuel Salto-Tellez4,5, Edison T Liu1,7 and Kartiki V Desai8*AbstractIntroduction: We developed an analytic strategy that correlates gene expression and clinical outcomes as a meansto identify novel candidate oncogenes operative in breast cancer. This analysis, followed by functionalcharacterization, resulted in the identification of Jumonji Domain Containing 6 (JMJD6) protein as a novel driver ofoncogenic properties in breast cancer.Methods: Through microarray informatics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the correlationbetween gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients in 14 independent breast cancercohorts. JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival.Immunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assayselucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinicalbreast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action.Results: JMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like,Claudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity,advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrinemonotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer celllines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stableoverexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231,decreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not conferinvasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-proliferation genes and genes of the TGF-b tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized byconstitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-b2 could be extrapolated tothe breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer.Conclusions: JMJD6 is a novel biomarker of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancergrowth and migration.IntroductionIn breast cancer, resistance to standard-of-care systemicadjuvant treatments such as endocrine and chemothera-pies remains a major health burden and prompts theneed for novel therapeutic targets for patients withadvanced, unresponsive, or relapsed disease. We pre-viously used gene-expression profiles of breast tumors toidentify extracellular/secretory proteins and cell surface-receptor genes whose high expression levels associatewith poor clinical end points. For example, we recentlyidentified serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1)as an important therapeutic target in breast cancer byusing a combined genotype and phenotype screeningapproach. We found that inhibition of SPINK1 by* Correspondence: kd1@nibmg.ac.in8National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, 2nd Floor Netaji SubashSanatorium, Kalyani 741251, IndiaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleLee et al.

A second candidate identified in thesame study was the phosphatidylserine receptor (PTDSR).Formerly, PTDSR was thought to be a cell-surfaceprotein that facilitates recruitment of phagocytic cells tosites of apoptosis. Antibodies against PTDSR andannexin V have been used in combination to estimateapoptosis [2]. Mouse knockouts of PTDSR showed earlypostnatal lethality and had growth retardation and mul-tiple developmental abnormalities due to insufficient dif-ferentiation during embryogenesis; however, no defect inapoptotic clearance of cells was evident [3]. By genera-tion of deletion mutants and immune localization, Cuiet al. [4] demonstrated that PTDSR is a nuclear protein,with five nuclear localization signals scattered through-out its sequence. Later, PTDSR was renamed Jumonjidomain containing 6 (JMJD6) based on the presence ofits JMJC domain with bifunctional histone argininedemethylation and lysyl oxidase activity [4-6]. JMJD6 ishomologous to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) aspar-aginyl-hydroxylase, suggesting a function in cellularresponse to hypoxia. In addition, JMJD6 protein wasrecently shown to interact with splicing factor U2AF65;however, very few splicing events in a limited number ofgenes were attributable to JMJD6 expression [6]. Inendothelial cells, alternate splicing of VEGF receptor(Flt1) by U2AF65 promoted endothelial cell migration,and siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD6 in endothe-lial cells led to decreased migration [7]. Based on X-raycrystallographic data, it was predicted and shown thatapart from its enzymatic activity, JMJD6 protein boundsingle-stranded RNA [8]. These diverse findings predicta range of versatile functions for JMJD6, at the tran-scriptional, splicing, posttranscriptional, and biochemicallevels. However, very little is known about the role ofJMJD6 in cancer and the molecular pathways that mayimpinge on disease initiation and prognosis.Because our in silico analysis demonstrated a robustpositive association between JMJD6 expression andbreast cancer recurrence, we investigated its phenotypicand molecular effects in breast cancer cells. We reportherein that perturbation of JMJD6 expression modulatescell proliferation and cell scattering and motility: pheno-types associated with cancer metastasis. Furthermore,our findings suggest that these cellular phenotypes maybe elicited by JMJD6-mediated suppression of trans-forming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-b2) and/or activa-tion of proteins that potentiate cell division in a celltype-specific manner. These in vitro mechanistic find-ings are consistent with the clinical observations thatJMJD6 expression correlates positively with proliferationindex and high histologic grade but inversely with TGF-b2 expression. Together, these data implicate JMJD6function in breast tumor progression and suggest a diag-nostic role for JMJD6 in predicting patient outcomes.Materials and methodsBreast cancer clinical datasetsTumor-expression profiles were obtained with approvalfrom and in accordance with the policies of the institu-tional review boards of the respective institutions. Anintegrated \u201cSuper Cohort\u201d (SC) of 15 individual Affyme-trix array datasets comprising 2,116 breast cancerpatients was used in this analysis. These datasets werepreviously described in detail in Soon et al. [1]. Thesecohorts were accessible from public databases, GeneExpression Omnibus (National Center for BiotechnologyInformation, Bethesda, MD, USA), ArrayExpress (Eur-opean Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK), and caAr-ray (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Atlanta, GA, USA).Appropriate permission has been granted for the use ofthe datasets and corresponding de-identified clinicaldata. A summary of the clinical dataset details and lit-erature references can be found in Additional file 1,Table S1. Initial discovery and meta-analysis was per-formed on a subset of this Super Cohort.All raw data (CEL files) were preprocessed and nor-malized by using the R software package [9], and libraryfiles provided via the Bioconductor [10]. Raw data wereMAS5.0 normalized on a per-cohort basis by using thejustMAS function in the simpleaffy library from Biocon-ductor (no background correction, target intensity of600). Cross-cohort batch effects were corrected by usingthe COMBAT empirical Bayes method [11]. NormalizedJMJD6 probesets, 212722_s_at and 212723_at, wereaveraged for the analysis of data from Affymetrix U133arrays, and JMJD6 probe, AB011157, was used for theanalysis of the Agilent array dataset (that is, the NKIdataset). Of 2,116 array profiles in the Super Cohort,1,954 patient cases are annotated with distant metasta-sis-free survival (DMFS) time and event information.Clinical survival analysis and expression in subtypesDistant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was used as theclinical end point of interest. A DMFS event was definedas metastatic recurrence to a distant organ site or in alimited number of cases, as death owing to progressivebreast cancer. Cox proportional hazard regression analy-sis of JMJD6 expression with DMFS data (Time andEvent) was performed in individual patient datasets andin the Super Cohort. Clinical subtype analysis was per-formed by using the Super Cohort. Intrinsic subtypeswere assigned via the PAM50 algorithm of Parker et al.[12], by using the code provided by the authors at UNCMicroarray Database [13]. Gene data were matched bysymbol and median centered, and Spearman correlationwas used to assign samples to the nearest PAM50Lee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 2 of 16centroid. Claudin-Low subtypes were assigned based onthe method described by Prat et al. [14], by using themicroarray data (GSE18229) and information providedby the authors at UNC Microarray Database [13]. Clau-din-Low and Normal centroids were generated, andsamples were assigned to one or the other class basedon euclidean distance to the class centroid. The PAM50and Claudin-Low subtype information was then com-bined with the PAM50 subtype used, unless a samplehad been classified as Claudin-Low, in which case, theClaudin-Low assignment would take precedence.Distribution of JMJD6 expression in various breastcancer subtypes was analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallisone-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks andmultiple pairwise comparisons with the Dunn methodby using Sigma Plot. Statistical significance of differen-tial JMJD6 expression in ER-positive versus ER-negativetumors was analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney RankSum Test. In Kaplan-Meier and CoxPH survival analysisof JMJD6 expression cohorts in the clinical subtypes, thepatients were separated by median expression across theSuper Cohort into high and low JMJD6-expressiongroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also was per-formed on patient groups ranked by quartile expressionwithin each clinical subtype. All survival analyses wereperformed by using Sigma Plot [15].ImmunohistochemistryTissue microarray (TMA) blocks containing cores from98 breast cancer patients were constructed, as describedpreviously, under institutional ethics committee approvalwith consent for the tissue microarray program (NUS-IRB 05-017) [1,16,17] and used for the analysis. Anti-JMJD6 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,CA, USA: Sc-28348) was used at a dilution of 1:50 alongwith antigen retrieval by heat and Tris-EDTA (pH 9.1).Automated IHC scoring was performed with the AriolSL-50 image analysis system (Applied Imaging, SantaClara, CA, USA). Positivity of JMJD6 nuclear expressionwas defined as nuclear-staining intensity and percentagecoverage scores \u226525%. Odds-ratio analysis was per-formed on JMJD6-positive expression and clinicopatho-logic features of the tumors by using PASW Statistics18 [18].Cell linesAll cell lines were obtained from American Type Cul-ture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in growthmedia, at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The growth medium forMCF-7, CAMA-1, and BT-549 was Dulbecco ModifiedEagle Medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS); and for MDA-MB231 and T47D, it was RPMI-1640, with 10% FBS.Cloning and expression of JMJD6JMJD6 (NM_001081461.1) (J1) was amplified by usingMCF-7 mRNA (forward primer: 5\u2019CCCAAGCTTAT-GAACCACAAGAGCAAGAAG3\u2019; reverse primer: 5\u2019GCTCTAGATCACCTGGAGGAGCTGCG 3\u2019), followedby reamplification with forward primer: 5\u2019 GAGGTAC-CATGAACCACAAGAGCA 3\u2019 and reverse primer: 5\u2019CGCTCGAGTGGGGGTGAGCCCGGCCT 3\u2019 andligated into TOPO pCR2.1 vector. All clones weresequence verified. JMJD6 was cloned from TOPO vec-tors into a gateway entry vector pENTR3C (Invitrogen)and then recombined into the lentivirus vectorpLenti6.2/V5-DEST (Invitrogen), pLenti4/V5-Dest (Invi-trogen), and pcDNA3.1/V5-Dest (Invitrogen) by LRrecombination, according to the manufacturer\u2019s proto-col. For lentiviral clones, pLenti6.2/V5-DEST orpLenti4/V5-Dest was co-transfected with packaging vec-tors (Invitrogen) into 293 FT cells, and the supernatantwas harvested approximately 48 hours for packaged len-tivirus. For infection of MCF-7 cells, the cells were pla-ted at 50% confluence and incubated with 20 \u03bcl to 30 \u03bclof the concentrated virus and 8 \u03bcg/ml of hexamethrinebromide (Polybrene) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. The cellswere replated and cultured with Zeocin (Invitrogen) toobtain several clones (MCF7-J1-OE). The pcDNA3.1vector was used to generate JMJD6 expression clones bytransfection by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)into MDA-MB231, T47D, and CAMA cell lines. Stableclones were selected with gentamycin (Gibco).Knockdown of JMJD6 geneSiRNA was reverse transfected (by using manufacturer\u2019sprotocol) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) intothe cell lines. At 48 hours after transfection, the cellswere reconstituted in fresh media for experimentalassays. JMJD6 siRNAs used were as follows: siRNA A(Ambion: 111915)- gcuauggugaacacccuaatt; siRNA B(Dharmacon: D-010363-01)- gaacugggauucacaucga;siRNA C (Dharmacon: D-010363-02)- ggauaacgauggcua-cuca; and siRNA D (Dharmacon: D- 010363-05)-ggacccggcacaacuacua. A nontargeting scrambled siRNAserved as a negative control (Ambion: 4635).Cell-based assaysFor proliferation assay, cells were plated in 96-wellplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. Cell prolifera-tion was measured by using WST-1 (Roche) every24 hours over a 4- to 5-consecutive-day period, accord-ing to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For detecting apoptosis,cells were transfected in a 96-well plate with siRNAsand assessed for apoptotic markers after 48 hours. Inbrief, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, andcells were permeabilized with Triton-X 100. Fixed cellsLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 3 of 16were probed with active PARP (BD, 552596) antibody,and the primary antibodies were detected by a second-ary antibody conjugated to fluors Alexa 488 (BD,A21121). ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics) was used to detectimmunofluorescence, and the baseline threshold was setby using cells stained with secondary antibody alone inthe absence of the primary antibody.Scatter assayCells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 300cells per well and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fifteenfields of colonies per cell type were captured on day 7 ofgrowth and blindly scored for three categories of scatter-ing (compact, loose, and scatter) by two random indivi-duals from six people. An average score was calculatedfor each colony, and the percentage of colonies for eachcategory of scattering was plotted [19].Wound-healing assayCells were plated in culture inserts (Ibidi) with approxi-mately 500 \u03bcM gap. After 2 days (confluent cells), theinserts were removed, and fresh medium with 5 \u03bcg/ml ofmitomycin C (Calbiochem, 47589) was added. The dis-tances moved by the cells across the gap were measured at24 hours and calculated as a ratio over the initial distanceat 0 hours, and these data were further normalized to theratio of distance in Vec control.Invasion and migration assayIn vitro migration and invasion of the cells were assessedby using Falcon FluoroBlok 24-Multiwell inserts with8-\u03bcm pores (BD Biosciences). For invasion assays, theinserts were coated with 20 \u03bcg of Matrigel in 80 \u03bcl ofserum-free media. Cell suspension (200 \u03bcl) in serum-freemedia was loaded into each transwell insert, and 750 \u03bclof medium with 10% FBS was provided in the lowerchamber; 4 \u00d7 104 MDA-MB231/BT-549 cells were loadedin each transwell. The assay was done for 18 hours formigration and 24 hours for invasion. The cells that hadmigrated or invaded through the inserts were fixed with3.7% formaldehyde and stained with propidium iodide,2 \u03bcg/ml (Calbiochem), for 30 minutes, washed with PBS,and counted for 10 fields by using the Target ActivationBioapplication on an ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics). Assayresults for siRNA-treated MDA-MB231 cells were nor-malized to fold change observed in proliferation at Day 2and then calculated as a ratio to the Sc siRNA control.Microarray data analysisMCF-7 J1 clones were harvested for RNA isolation at80% confluence. For siRNA-mediated knockdown ofJMJD6 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the cells were har-vested for RNA isolation immediately, 48 hours aftertransfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS and har-vested by trypsinization. RNA was extracted by Trizol(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Threebiological replicates of MCF-7 J1 clones and two inde-pendent siRNA-transfection replicates were used for themicroarray hybridization. Processing of samples forhybridization on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 was doneaccording to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The microarraydata were uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus(accession number, GSE31782). Raw data were MAS5-normalized and log transformed by using GenespringGX11.5. To extract differential gene expression, Gene-Spring GX 11.5 was used to perform two-way ANOVAfor siRNA-specific changes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. The list of significantly differential genes (P <0.05) was further filtered for genes with at least 1.5-foldchange in expression in at least one of the siRNA treat-ments for either MCF-7 or MDA-MB231. For MCF-7J1-OE clones, one-way ANOVA was performed toextract differential gene expression in the overexpressionclones as compared with the Vec. Only genes that dif-fered in their expression by 1.5-fold in at least one ofthe clones were selected for further analysis. Genes thatoverlapped in both siRNA treatment and in J1 clonesand those that were regulated in the opposite directionwere selected for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [20].Hierarchical clustering by average linkage and visualiza-tion of the clusters was performed by using Cluster andTreeview, respectively [21,22].To extract differential gene expression specific toMDA-MB231, GeneSpring GX11.5 was used to per-form one-way ANOVA in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7independently. The list of significant genes that weredifferentially expressed (1.5-fold; P < 0.05) was fil-tered. Probesets unique to MDA-MB231 that wereabsent in MCF-7 lists were extracted for IPA func-tional analysis.Real-time PCRTotal RNA was reverse transcribed by using Maximareverse transcriptase mix (Fermentas). Real-time PCRwas performed by using SYBR-Green PCR Mix (Fer-mentas) and run on CFX384 Real Time PCR DetectionSystem (Biorad). Ct values were generated by using CFXmanager software (Biorad). The primers used are listedin the Additional file 2, Table S2.Conditioned mediaTo obtain conditioned media, plated cells were incu-bated with serum-free media for 24 hours before collec-tion. The media were spun down to remove any celldebris and then concentrated \u00d760 to 80 by using Ami-con Ultra centrifugation filter (Millipore).Lee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 4 of 16Immunoblot analysisWhole-cell lysates were prepared by using RIPA buffer forall antibodies, except TGF-bs, detected in conditionedmedia. Protein concentration was quantified by usingProtein Assay reagent (Biorad) with BSA standards. Equalamounts of total protein lysates (20 to 40 \u03bcg) were ana-lyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDFmembrane (GE Healthcare and Millipore). Antibodiesagainst JMJD6 (Abcam, ab10526), b-actin (Sigma, A5441),V5 tag (Invitrogen, R960-25), E-cadherin (Cell Signaling,4065), vimentin (BD Pharmingen, 550513), TGF-b2(Abcam, ab36495), phosphorylated SMAD2 (Cell Signal-ing, 3108 and 3104), phosphorylated SMAD3 (Cell Signal-ing, 4520), SMAD2/3 (Cell Signaling, 3102), cyclin D1(ab24249), cyclin E1 (Abcam, ab3927), and cyclin E2(Abcam, ab40890) were used to probe for the protein onthe membrane. The detection was done by using HRP-conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz) and ECL or ECL Plusreagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reactive proteins wereidentified with autoradiography.TGF-b2 neutralization and Smad phosphorylation assaysCells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000cells per well and changed to fresh media with either 5ng/ml of recombinant human (rh) TGF-b2 (R&D Sys-tems, 302-B2) or BSA the next day. Cell-viability mea-surement was taken on the first day of TGF-b2 orBSA treatment and 3 days later by using WST-1 assay.To inhibit TGF-b2 action, cells were plated in 96-wellplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. After24 hours, they were exposed to 10 \u03bcM SB431542(Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO (as vehicle control)before transfection with JMJD6 siRNA. The cells werechanged to fresh media 48 hours after transfection, con-taining 10 \u03bcM SB431542 or DMSO. Cell viability wasdetermined on the first day of SB431542 or DMSOtreatment and 3 days later by WST-1 assay. For assess-ment of SMAD2 phosphorylation, cells were plated atapproximately 50% confluence in six-well plates for24 hours. The cells were pretreated for 2 hours withSB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO, beforeaddition of 5 ng/ml of rhTGF-b2 (R&D Systems, 302-B2). Protein lysates were harvested 1 hour after rhTGF-b2 treatment for immunoblot analysis.Clinical correlation between TGF-b2 and JMJD6The super-cohort dataset was used to assess correlation,if any, between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 expression. TGF-b2probesets, 209908_s_at, 220407_s_at, 209909_s_at, and220406_at, were averaged for the clinical microarraydata analysis. Correlation of JMJD6 expression andTGF-b2 expression was performed by using the Pearsoncorrelation test on PASW Statistics 18 [18].ResultsJMJD6 transcript levels correlate with poor prognosis inbreast cancerTo discover novel oncogenes associated with breast can-cer progression, we used an informatics approach [1] andmined multiple independent microarray datasets ofbreast tumor profiles for genes having significant andreproducible associations with distant metastasis-freesurvival (DMFS). JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate,because its expression was significantly and positivelyassociated with decreased time to distant metastasis ineight of the 14 breast cancer cohorts examined (Figure 1and Additional file 1, Table S1). Furthermore, in an inte-grated Super Cohort (SC) (n = 1,954) comprisingthe majority of the individual cohorts listed in Table 1(see Methods and Additional file 1, Table S1), highJMJD6 expression was significantly associated withdecreased time to distant metastasis with a hazard ratioof 1.92 (95% CI, 1.62 to 2.29; P < 0.001). Together, theseobservations indicate a robust and reproducible associa-tion between JMJD6 expression and aggressive clinicalbehavior of breast cancer that may reflect an underlyingfunctional contribution of JMJD6 in breast cancerprogression.JMJD6 expression in breast cancer subtypesBreast cancers were classified based on hormone-receptorstatus, estrogen receptor (ER+/-), or gene expression intointrinsic subtypes as described by Perou et al. [23].Because these subclasses show differential survival, weanalyzed the expression level of JMJD6 in each subtypeannotated in the Super Cohort. As shown in Figure 2A,overall ER- tumors had slightly but significantly elevatedexpression of JMJD6 (P < 0.001). The average JMJD6expression differed across the intrinsic subtypes. JMJD6expression was highest in Claudin-low tumors and basalsubtypes, followed by HER2, whereas in the ER+ group,the luminal B (LumB) expressed more JMJD6 than didluminal A (LumA) (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). We examinedthe survival outcome of JMJD6 high- and low-expressergroups, determined by median separation across the SuperCohort, within each subtype. Because ER- tumors had veryhigh levels of JMJD6 expression, further separation basedon JMJD6 levels and survival analysis bore no significance(Table 1). In ER+ tumors, high JMJD6 expressers hadpoorer outcome than low expressers (Figure 2C; P <0.001), and this persisted on subdivision of ER+ into lumi-nal subclasses (Figure 2D and 2E). Further, in the tamoxi-fen-treated samples, high JMJD6 expressers had worseoutcome. However, whether JMJD6 predicts endocrinefailure must be studied further. These data are summar-ized in Table 1. Other than total cohort median-basedseparation of patients, we also examined the relation ofLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 5 of 16JMJD6 levels and prognosis by quartile assignment ofJMJD6 expression in each subtype independently. Withthis method, we observed that extremely high expressionof JMJD6 (upper quartile) significantly led to worse survi-val outcomes in luminal A and luminal B subtypes (P <0.05) (see Additional file 3, Figure S1). Therefore, we con-clude that JMJD6 is a marker for tumor aggressivenessand maybe is prognostic of poor outcome in ER+ breastcancer.JMJD6 protein associates with high-grade and ER- tumorsTo study the distribution of JMJD6 protein levels, weimmunohistochemically (IHC) stained an 81-breasttumor tissue array by using a JMJD6-specific antibody(Figure 3A). MCF-7-J1 OE and JMJD6 siRNA-treatedcells were used to confirm the specificity of the antibody(see Additional file 4, Figure S2). As shown, JMJD6 waspresent predominantly in the nuclei of breast tumorcells, with increased staining evident in higher grades ofbreast tumors. Univariate analysis clearly identified anassociation between high JMJD6 staining, high grade,and ER negativity (Figure 3B). Similar to the RNA-expression data, JMJD6 protein was highly expressed inmore-aggressive and advanced tumors. However,because of the low sample size, our analysis could notexplore whether JMJD6 correlates with outcome inluminal tumors. Nonetheless, JMJD6 appears to be arelevant marker in breast cancer pathogenesis.JMJD6 increases proliferation in MCF-7 cellsBecause the JMJD6 expression profile was similar to theproliferative gene cluster, as characterized by Perou et al.[14,24], we posited that perturbation of its levels mayaffect cell proliferation (Figure 2A and 2B). We studiedJMJD6 expression in a panel of five breast cancer cell lines(see Additional file 5, Figure S3A). With the exception ofMCF-7 cells, JMJD6 was highly expressed in breast cancercell lines. We used a lentiviral-based cloning system toinfect MCF-7 cells with V5-tagged JMJD6 and achievedstable expression of JMJD6 (MCF-7 J1-OE). As a pool,these cells showed increased proliferation (see Additionalfile 6, Figure S4), and this was confirmed in individualclones, J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7 (Figure 4A). Over a periodof 5 days, MCF-7-J1-OE clones (J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7)showed higher proliferation as early as day 2 and contin-ued to grow faster as compared with empty vector controlcells (Vec) (Figure 4A). Next we silenced JMJD6 expres-sion in all five cell lines by using a panel of siRNAs andassayed their proliferation. We achieved 80% to 100%silencing of JMJD6 protein, depending on the basal, endo-genous expression level of JMJD6 (see Additional file 5,Figure 1 High JMJD6 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival outcome. Cox regression analysis of JMJD6 expression and distantmetastasis-free survival of patients was initially performed in 14 microarray expression datasets independently and then subsequently on a\u201cSuper Cohort\u201d (SC) comprising 15 Affymetrix array-based cohorts, including a subset of the 14 cohorts used initially. Hazard ratios and their 95%confidence intervals are shown in the forest plot. Datasets are listed on the Y-axis; all platforms are from Affymetrix array series, with theexception of NKI from Agilent.

Four different siRNAs resulted in profoundloss of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB231 cells(Figure 4B and 4C). This decrease was not due toincreased apoptosis, because higher levels of cleaved PARPwere not evident in the JMJD6 knockdown cells (see Addi-tional file 5, Figure S3B). Similar to MCF7 and MDA-MB231, siRNA treatment decreased proliferation in theremaining cell lines: BT-549, CAMA-1, and T47D (seeAdditional file 5, Figure S3C). Together, these results sug-gest that high levels of JMJD6 lead to increased cell prolif-eration. To determine whether further induction of JMJD6in cells with intrinsically higher JMJD6 levels shows anadditive increase in cell proliferation, we generatedMB231-J1-OE, T47D-J1-OE, and CAMA-J1-OE cells (seeAdditional file 7, Figure S5). However, an increased dosageof JMJD6 did not further augment cell growthJMJD6 enhances scattering and motilityOur in silico analysis and IHC data showed that JMJD6 isassociated with aggressive advanced disease. We next stu-died whether this protein could influence cell motilityand invasion by using cell-scatter, wound-healing, andBoyden chamber assays. The motility and invasion assayswere performed within 24 hours to minimize secondaryeffects of cell proliferation. For the scattering phenotype,we used a counting system previously described by Shtut-man et al. [19] to evaluate the degree of scattering(Figure 5A). All three MCF-7-J1-OE clones showed anincrease in scattering as compared with Vec cells. Anincrease in scattering often implies a gain in motility orepithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). There-fore, we assayed loss of E-cadherin and gain in vimentinas markers for EMT. Immunoblots showed that MCF-7J1-OE clones maintained E-cad expression (see Addi-tional file 8, Figure S6), suggesting that the scattering isprobably encouraged by motility. Indeed, in a wound-healing assay, MCF-7-J1-OE clones closed the woundmuch faster than did Vec cells (Figure 5B). Becauseincreased cell number due to increased proliferation canmislead interpretation of wound-healing data; we per-formed these assays in the presence of mitomycin C, aninhibitor of cell division. Despite a gain in motility, wewere unable to demonstrate an increase in invasive beha-vior in MCF-7-J1-OE cells (data not shown). However, inMDA-MB231, a highly motile and invasive cell line,knockdown of JMJD6 significantly attenuated both prop-erties (Figure 5C). To negate the contribution ofdecreased proliferation in this assay, we normalized theseresults to the proliferation changes observed on day 2(Figure 5C). However, the cells maintained loss in moti-lity and invasion, showing that this property was inde-pendent of proliferation defects. Together, these dataimply that JMJD6 is not a \u201cdriver\u201d of cell invasion butmay augment cell movement.Figure 2 JMJD6 expression and prognosis in intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.

We selected 2,216 overlappingprobe sets that were commonly and appropriately regu-lated in all three settings: MCF-7-J1-OE, MCF-7 siRNA,and MDA-MB231 siRNA (see Additional file 9, Table S3).Figure 3 Nuclear JMJD6 protein expression is associated with high-grade breast tumors.

We analyzed these two gene setswith Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [20]. In accordance withour cell-based assays, in the JMJD6-induced gene set, thetop enriched functions were cell-cycle and DNA replica-tion, followed by cellular assembly and cellular movement(Figure 6; see Additional file 10, Table S4). In the JMJD6-repressed subset, a large number of genes were related tocancer function (120) (Figure 6). Among the associatedgene functions, we observed a significant downregulationof TGF-b isoforms, the classic cell-cycle inhibitors [25-27](see Additional file 10, Table S4), which was further con-firmed by using quantitative RT-PCR. Loss of JMJD6increased TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 expression, whereas TGF-b3 was unaffected in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 (Fig-ure 7A and 7B). Protein analysis suggested that bothJMJD6 siRNAs induced a high level of TGF-b2 secretionin the two cell lines (Figure 7C). In contrast, in MCF-7-J1-Figure 5 JMJD6 promotes motility in breast cancer cell lines. (A) Scatter phenotype was scored based on three levels of scattering(compact, loose, scatter) (upper panel). Bar graphs represent quantification of scattering of colonies by using the Student t test (lower panel).MCF-7 J1 OE clones had a higher percentage of scattered or loosely scattered clones than did the control Vec cells.

(C) Boyden-chamber assay results of MDA-MB231 cellswith JMJD6 siRNA-mediated knockdown were normalized to fold change in proliferation at Day 2 of WST-1 measurement.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 9 of 16OE cells, a significant decrease in TGF-b2 mRNA and pro-tein expression was observed (Figure 7D and 7E). At theprotein level, we failed to detect changes in TGF-b1 andTGF-b3, although both isoforms were expressed (data notshown). Therefore, of the three isoforms, TGF-b2 prob-ably was more engaged in JMJD6-mediated cellularproliferation.JMJD6 possibly engages multiple pathways to increasecell proliferationJMJD6 suppressed TGF-b2 expression and cell prolifera-tion in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells. However,TGF-b2 mediates cell-cycle arrest only in MCF-7 cells,but not in MDA-MB 231, T47D, and CAMA-1 cells[28-30]. Therefore, TGF-b2 may not be the mediator ofFigure 6 IPA analysis of JMJD6-regulated genes showed enrichment in cell-cycle function. (A) The heatmap (top panel) shows thathierarchic clustering of the genes changed after siRNA knockdown and overexpression of JMJD6. The sample labels are on the top of the heatmap. Two clusters representing JMJD6-induced and JMJD6-repressed genes were selected (middle heat-map panel) and subjected to IPAanalysis. (B) Table shows a list of the top 10 functions that are enriched in cells with altered levels of JMJD6.Lee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 10 of 16cell-cycle arrest in the latter three cell lines, even thoughMDA-MB231s are responsive to TGF-b in terms ofSMAD phosphorylation and TGF-b-mediated transcrip-tional changes [31]. To test the functionality of TGF-b2, we did the following: (a) assessed Smad2/3 phos-phorylation levels in both cells, (b) neutralized TGF-b2by using a TGF-b type I receptor inhibitor SB431542and assayed Smad phosphorylation and cell proliferationin the absence of JMJD6, and (c) treated MCF-7-J1OEcells with recombinant TGF- b2.By treatment of recombinant TGF-b2 on MCF-7 andMDA-MB231, we confirmed that both cell linesresponded with increased SMAD2 phosphorylation,which suggests intact TGF-b receptor signaling (Figure8; see Additional file 11, Figure S7A). Similarly, anincrease in SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation withJMJD6 siRNA treatment was seen in both MCF-7 andMDA-MB231, as opposed to a decrease observed in theMCF-7 J1 OE clones (Figure 8). Interestingly, basalSMAD levels themselves were affected, which parallelsthe transcript-level change detected in our expressionarray (Figure 6). When we inhibited SMAD phosphory-lation by using an Alk-5 receptor inhibitor (SB431542),we observed a significantly higher rescue of proliferationin MCF-7 JMJD6 knockdown cells (Figure 9A and 9B).Because MDA-MB 231 cells are refractory to TGF-b2-mediated cell-cycle inhibition, SB431542 should have noeffect on MDA-MB231 growth suppression. Accord-ingly, the suppressed proliferation could not be rescuedby the Alk-5 receptor inhibitor treatment in this celltype (see Additional file 11, Figure S7).Last, treatment of MCF-7 J1-OE cells with recombi-nant TGF-b2 repressed proliferation in both Vec andJ1-OE cells, suggesting that MCF-7 retained sensitivityto TGF-b2-mediated growth regulation despite increasedJMJD6 levels (Figure 9C). Therefore, JMJD6 did notconfer unresponsiveness to this growth factor, but prob-ably mediated its effect via repression of gene expres-sion. Together these data suggest that in MCF-7 cells,JMJD6 mediates cell-cycle regulation, in part by sup-pressing TGF-b2.Secretion of TGF-b2 cannot explain the growth arrestin JMJD6 siRNA-treated MDA MB 231 cells. Scanningof microarray data revealed that JMJD6 changed thelevels of G1 cyclins: cyclins E1, E2, and D at the RNAlevel. In MDA MB 231 cells, we confirmed a loss inFigure 7 JMJD6 represses TGF-b2 expression. RT-qPCR assays of TGF-bs after JMJD6 siRNA-mediated knockdown are shown in (A) MCF-7 and(B) MDA-MB231. Consistently, TGF-b2 and TGF-b1 mRNA levels were upregulated on JMJD6 knockdown. (C) Immunoblots showed that theamount of secreted TGF-b2 protein in conditioned media was higher after JMJD6 siRNA-mediated knockdown in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231.

Interestingly,cyclin E1/E2 was decreased in MCF-7 JMJD6 siRNA-treated cells and induced in MCF-7-J1 OE cells and(Figure 10). Together these data indicate that in bothcells, JMJD6 mediated suppression of TGF-b2. In MCF-7 cells, the proliferation is controlled by both TGF-b2and cyclin E regulation, but in MDA 231 cells, theFigure 8 JMJD6 expression affects SMAD phosphorylation. Immunoblots show that the levels of total SMAD2/3, phosphorylated SMAD2,and phosphorylated SMAD3 are decreased in MCF-7 J1-OE clones and increased in JMJD6 siRNA-mediated knockdown in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 12 of 16cyclin E regulation may contribute to this phenotype,rather than TGF-b2 signaling. Other pathways thatoperate in MDA-MB 231 cells must be explored further.Clinical data for JMJD6 and TGF-b2Finally, by using expression data from the clinicalcohorts, we observed a marginal but significant inversecorrelation of JMJD6 with TGF-b2 (Pearson correlationvalue, -0.118; P value = 9.13 \u00d7 10-8) (Figure 11). Thissuggests that this TGF-b2 mechanism observed in vitrocould be extrapolated to patient data and that the MCF-7-OE cells could serve as a model system to explore thepathways involved in further detail.DiscussionThrough microarray informatics, we identified JMJD6 asa candidate oncogene associated with poor patient prog-nosis. Consistent with its potential as a marker of breastcancer aggressiveness, JMJD6 was expressed at highestlevels in ER-, basal, claudin-low, HER2-enriched, andLuminal B tumor subtypes, which are known to be clini-cally associated with poor patient outcomes. Mostimportant, in the less-aggressive ER+ subtypes (forexample, Luminal A), high levels of JMJD6 could predictpoor outcome and possibly resistance to tamoxifenmonotherapy. Protein analysis by using tissue microar-ray confirmed that high JMJD6 expression is consistentlyassociated with ER- disease, higher grade, and advancedstage. These data demonstrate for the first time thatJMJD6 is a relevant prognostic biomarker in breastcancer.By phenotypic and functional analysis, we found thatJMJD6 induced an increase in cell scattering andincreased the rate of wound closure in MCF-7 cells, butdid not confer an invasive phenotype. In invasive cellslike MDA-MB231 and BT-549 with high expression ofJMJD6, siRNA-mediated suppression led to loss of bothmotility and invasiveness properties. Because forcedJMJD6 expression did not confer invasiveness, thisapparent loss of invasiveness most likely follows a lossin motility. Nonetheless, JMJD6 may have a critical rolein epithelial cell movement, and we showed that thisproperty is not restricted to endothelial cells [7]. How-ever, this appears to be a minor function of JMJD6,because its exogenous expression did not induce epithe-lial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (that is, we didnot observe a loss or gain in E-cadherin or vimentinexpression, respectively, in MCF-7 J1-OE cells).The most prominent effect of JMJD6 perturbation wason cell proliferation. SiRNA-mediated attenuation ofJMJD6 in multiple breast cancer cells led to a decreasein cell proliferation without activation of cellular apop-tosis, whereas forced expression in MCF-7 resulted in amassive increase in cell proliferation. This finding isconsistent with the observation that JMJD6-knockoutmice are small and show growth retardation [3]. Therole of JMJD6 in proliferation is further substantiated byour microarray analysis, which revealed that modulationof JMJD6 expression significantly affected the expressionlevels of a number of cell cycle-associated genes (seeAdditional file 10, Table S4). Although JMJD6 is thoughtto mediate splicing by physical interaction with U2AF65,we obtained very little evidence for alternate transcriptsin both cell lines. Conversely, we documented a largenumber of transcriptional changes in J1-OE clones andJMJD6 knockdowns.The TGF-b pathway, particularly TGF-b2, was down-regulated when JMJD6 was overexpressed and inducedwhen JMJD6 was depleted. We validated the inverserelation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 at both RNA andprotein levels in these cellular systems. We extendedthis observation to clinical samples and observed aninverse correlation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 in ourbreast cancer cohorts. Such antagonistic roles of JMJD6and TGF-b2 have a precedent in eye development. Oneof the distinctive developmental defects of JMJD6-Figure 10 Decrease of cyclin E2 protein level in JMJD6knockdown. Western blot detection of G1 cell-cycle cyclins isshown. A decrease in cyclin E2 (CCNE2) level with decrease inJMJD6 levels was evident in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. Cyclin E1(CCNE1) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) displayed an inconsistent changeon JMJD6 siRNA transfection in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells.Figure 11 Clinical association of JMJD6 with TGF-b2.

Scatterplot showsthe normalized JMJD6 expression of each patient sample with thecorresponding normalized TGF-b2 expression in the clinical datasetof 2,034 breast cancer patients.Lee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85Page 13 of 16knockout mice is the thinning of the retinal layer [3].Coincidentally, the knockout of TGF-b2 results in thehyperplasia of the neuroblastic layer of the retina [32].These data suggest that JMJD6 and TGF-b2 may befunctionally linked in cell-cycle regulation and indevelopment.Canonically, TGF-bs are known to exert antiprolifera-tive effects by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinaseinhibitors, p15 and p21, and/or downregulation ofCDK2 and cyclin E activity [26,27,33-35]. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 transfected with JMJD6 siRNA, weobserved suppression of cyclin E expression, and anincrease in cyclin E was evident when JMJD6 was over-expressed in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, in both cell lines,JMJD6 may exert a proliferative effect through a directincrease in cyclin E protein levels, or this increase maybe a consequence of JMJD6-mediated suppression ofTGF-b2. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the down-stream effectors, Smads, were phosphorylated on JMJD6siRNA-mediated secretion of TGF-b2. Specifically, inMCF-7, inhibition of TGF-b activity by using a TGF-btype I receptor (Alk5) inhibitor resulted in the loss ofSmad phosphorylation, rescue of arrested cells, and con-tinuation of proliferation (Figure 9). The Alk5 inhibitordid not reverse cell-cycle arrest in MDA-MB 231 cellsbecause they are refractory to the antiproliferative effectof TGF-b, suggesting that the JMJD6-cyclin E axis mayfunction independent of TGF-b2 in these cells. Intrigu-ingly, cyclin E is associated with poor prognosis, chro-mosomal instability, and trastuzumab resistance,suggesting that the long-term dysregulation of cell-cyclemediators by JMJD6 may affect more than just prolifera-tion [36-38].Our initial microarray analysis selected genes thatwere commonly regulated by JMJD6 in both MCF-7 andMDA-MB 231 cells. To elucidate further the mechan-isms behind JMJD6 siRNA-mediated growth suppressionin MDA-MB 231 cells, we reanalyzed gene-expressionchanges unique to MDA-MB 231 cells alone. We found1,864 probesets, with significant enrichment of genesinvolved in cellular death, growth and proliferation, andcell movement (P < 0.01; see Additional file 12, FigureS8). Close inspection showed at least 28 individualgenes in this proliferation gene cassette (see Additionalfile 13, Table S5); however, no connectivity or compel-ling pathway emerged that could be investigated further.ConclusionIn summary, our data indicate that JMJD6 has conservedfunctions and often affects similar pathways in a congru-ent manner across multiple cell types and at a gene-expression and phenotypic level. JMJD6 has ability topromote cancer cell proliferation and motility, which inturn may augment cancer virulence in vivo. In the clinic,JMJD6 associates with advanced grade, an aggressivephenotype, and serves as a marker of poor prognosis inbreast cancer. We propose that JMJD6 staining (withIHC) may serve a dual purpose in the clinic: to predictpoor outcome in patients, particularly in the ER+ sub-type, and to identify a patient subgroup wherein specificinhibitors of JMJD6 may facilitate the pathologic down-staging of tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.Additional materialAdditional file 1: Table S1.
