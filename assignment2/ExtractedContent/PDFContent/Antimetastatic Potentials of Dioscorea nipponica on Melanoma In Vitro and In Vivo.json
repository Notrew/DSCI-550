In the present study, we extracted Dioscorea nipponicaMakino with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethyl acetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5). We firstdemonstrate that DNE3 was found to be effective in reducing the lung metastases formation by about 99.5% as compared tovehicle-treated control animals. When a nontoxic concentration of the extract was treated directly to highly metastatic murinmelanoma cells (B16F10) and human melanoma cells (A2058) in vitro, it exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the invasion(P < .001), motility (P < .001), secretion of MMPs (P < .001), and u-PA (P < .001) of both cell lines. To investigate the possiblemechanisms involved in these events, we performed western blot analysis to find that DNE inhibited phosphorylation of Akt.A treatment with DNE3 to B16F10 cells also inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB and increased the expression of IkappaB. Takentogether, these findings suggested that DNE3 could reduce the metastasis of melanoma cells, thereby constituting an adjuvanttreatment for metastasis control.1. IntroductionEpidemiological studies have shown that a diet rich invegetables and fruits might protect against cancer by mech-anisms that have not been well defined yet. In recentyears, naturally occurring plant products have been gettingincreased attention for the intervention of malignant invasiveprogression in the late stage of neoplastic diseases [1, 2].On the basis of this idea, certain foods, including manyvegetables, fruits, and grains, as well as phytochemicals ofdiversified pharmacological efficacies have been shown tooffer a significant protection against various cancers [3\u20135].Furthermore, there is an increase focus on providing sci-entific basis to use these agents in the prevention strategyfor people with a high risk for cancers. Dioscorea nipponicaMakino has long been used as a folk medicine for bronchitis,asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. These compounds wereeffective for preventing both the body and adipose tissueweight gains in rodents induced by a high-fat diet [6].However, limited studies are available concerning the effectof Dioscorea nipponica Makino in anticancer.Invasion and metastasis of solid tumor involves multipleprocesses and various cytophysiological changes, includingchanged adhesion capability between cells and extracellular2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineDioscorea nipponica Makino 50 gH2O layerH2O layerH2O layerH2O layerExtract with CHCl3Extract with EtOAc CHCl3 layer(DNE2)EtOAc layer(DNE3)Extract with n-BuOHn-BuOH layer(DNE4)ResidueExtract with MeOHMeOH layer(DNE1)(DNE5)(a)Cellinvasion(control%)120100806040200Control DNE1 DNE2 DNE3 DNE4 DNE5100 \u03bcg/mL\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217(b)AU1.210.80.60.40.20P10 5 10 15 20 25 30(minutes)(c)Relativeabundance200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600410.87392.97285.06 426.97291.05272.95231.17545.12243.08 303.09 503.01266.9 439.21203.03 594.35178.88 341.08 356.451009080706050403020100582.75438.81m/z(d)Figure 1: The chemical profile of Dioscorea nipponica extract was analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry.

Among thesepeoteinase, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are type IV collagenasesthat degrade basement membrane collagen [8]. These twoMMPs are expressed in many different types of cancer cells;however, they are predominately produced in stromal cellslocated adjacent to the tumors [9]. In human malignancies,increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and expressionEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3B16F10B16F10DNE3 0.1/kg/dayB16F10DNE3 0.2/kg/day(a)0.80.60.40.20P < .001P < .001P < .001Normal B16F10 B16F10DNE3 0.1 gB16F10DNE3 0.2 gLungweight(g)(b)B16F10 B16F10DNE3 0.1 gB16F10DNE3 0.2 g350200150100500Numberofmetastasticlesions250300\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217 \u2217 \u2217(c)302520151050Averagebodyweight(g)0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21ControlDNE3 0.1 gDNE3 0.2 g(day)(d)Figure 2: Suppression of lung metastasis of melanoma cells by DNE3.

Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett\u2019s test ( \u2217\u2217\u2217P < .001). Results from 3 repeatedand separated experiments were similar.access to standard rodent chow diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). Cells (2\u00d7105 cells) suspendedin 0.1 mL of PBS were injected into the tail vain of C57BL/6mice. On the following day (Day 1), mice were randomlydivided into three groups (n = 8 for each group) to befed by oral gavage with saline (control) or DNE3 (0.1 g/kgand 0.2 g/kg of body weight, daily). Five untreated micewere used as wild type control. After 21 days, animals wereeuthanized with CO2. The lungs were isolated and weighed,and metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were countedunder a microscopy. Lungs were fixed in neutral buffered5% formalin, and sections were taken and stained withhematoxyline and eosine for morphological studies [15].2.5. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). Cells weretreated with DNE3 (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24hours. After treatment, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mLMTT in culture medium for an additional 4 h, and the blueformazan crystals of viable cells were dissolved by lysis buffer(isopropyl alcohol containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 NHCl) and measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm [4].2.6. Transwell Cell Invasion and Motility Assays. After a pre-treatment with DNE3 for 24 hours, cells were harvested andseeded to BD Falcon cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences,Bedford, MA, USA) at 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in serum-freemedium and then incubated for another 12 h at 37\u25e6C. Forinvasion assay, 100 \u03bcl Matrigel (1 mg/1 mL) was applied tothe membrane filters with a pore size of 8 \u03bcm and the bottomchamber contained standard medium. Filters were then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The invaded cells werefixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. Cell numberswere counted under a light microscope. The motility assaywas carried out as described in the invasion assay with nocoating of Matrigel [16].2.7. Wound Healing Migration Assay. Wounds were intro-duced to the confluent monolayer of cells with a yellowplastic pipette tip to create a cleared line. The medium wasremoved and replaced with DMEM containing 1% FBS, andthen DNE3 was added. The cells were incubated at 37\u25e6C, andcell movement into the wound area was photographed at 0 h,24 hours and 48 hours using a microscope.2.8. Cell-Matrix Adhesion Assay. After a 24-hour treatmentwith DNE3, cells were plated on 24-well dishes coatedwith 150 \u03bcl type I collagen (10 \u03bcg/mL) and cultured for 30minutes. Nonadherent cells were removed by PBS washes andadherent cells were fixed in ethanol. After staining with 0.1%crystal violet, fixed cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 andthe absorbance was measured at 550 nm [17].2.9. Determination of MMP-2, -9, and u-PA. In gelatinzymography, collected media were prepared with sodiumdodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer without boiling orreduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS polyacry-lamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to determine theMMPs. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5%Triton X-100 and then incubated in reaction buffer (40 mMTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) for 16 h at37\u25e6C.

Effects of DNE on the Invasion of Human Melanoma Cells.To evaluate the bioactive compound of Dioscorea nipponicaMakino, we successively extracted the Dioscorea nippon-ica with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethylacetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5)(Figure 1(a)). B16F10 cells were treated with differentDioscorea nipponica extracts, and a decrease of invasion wasdetected by Transwell invasion assay. Among these extracts,DNE3 was the most effective Dioscorea nipponica ingredientthat reduces invasion activity in our assay (Figure 1(b)).Chromatographic patterns from HPLC analysis of DNE3extracts showed peaks corresponding to the retention times.Absorbance was monitored at 254 nm (Figure 1(c)).

Cells weretreated with DNE3 for 24 hours and then subjected to analyze for motility ((a) and (c)) and invasion ((b) and (d)). Condition media weresubjected to gelatin zymography and casein zymography to analyze the activities of MMPs (e) and u-PA (f), respectively. Data representedthe mean\u00b1 SD of at least 3 independent experiments. Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett\u2019stest ( \u2217P < .05; \u2217\u2217P < .01; \u2217\u2217\u2217P < .001).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11B16F10 cells mainly form lung tumors. C57BL/6 mice wereinjected via the tail vein with B16F10 melanoma cells, andadministration of the ethyl acetate extracts of DEN3 reducedpulmonary metastasis formation of B16F10 cells. Within 21days of injection, the control mice were visibly riddled withmetastatic tumor nodules compared with the lungs of DNE3treated mice (Figure 2(a)). Mean lung weights for animalsreceiving 0.1 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1964 \u00b1 0.0594 g; P < .001)and 0.2 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1240 \u00b1 0.0125 g; P < .001) weresignificantly lower than those from control animals (0.4570\u00b10.1488 g; Figure 2(b)). Vehicle-treated control animals hadmassive growth of tumor and was given an arbitrary-maximum countable number about 275 \u00b1 45.3. It wasreduced to 14 \u00b1 5.4 (0.1 g/kg/day; P < .001) and 1.2 \u00b1 1.7(0.2 g/kg/day; P < .001) countable colonies by DNE3treatment (Figure 2(c)). The average body weight of DNE3treated mice was higher than control group (Figure 2(d)).Histopathology of the lung also showed marked reduction intumor mass in the lungs of DNE3-treated animals (Figure 3).3.3. Effect of DNE3 on Cell Viability. Results of MTT assayshowed that DNE3 has no cytotoxicity on B16F10 cells(Figure 4(a)). Results from same procedures performed onnormal human foreskin fibroblast cell lines, HS68, revealedthat this compound did not have any significant cytotoxicityon these cells (Figure 4(b)).3.4. Effects of DNE3 on the Invasion, Motility, Migration, andAdhesion. Incubation of B16F10 with 1% FBS produced amarked cell migration in the wound area 24 hours and48 hours after wounding whereas wounds treated withDNE3 showed significant delays in wound healing under thesame conditions (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). To screen for thepreventive effectors against cancer metastasis, the inhibitoryeffect of DNE3 on invasion and motility of B16F10 cellswas examined with Transwell. The result showed that DNE3significantly reduced the motility and invasion of B16F10cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4(e) and4(f)).Cancer cells, invading the host tissue, break from theircell-cell contacts and make new contact with the ECM.Therefore, DNE3 was tested to determine their effects onthe cell-matrix adhesion. The results showed that DNE3significantly reduced the cell-matrix interactions of B16F10cells (Figure 4(g)).3.5. Effects of DNE3 on the Activities of MMP-2, u-PA,and TIMP-2. Via gelatin and casein zymography assays,respectively, it has been shown that DNE3 significantlyreduced MMP-2 (Figure 5(a)) and u-PA (Figure 5(b)) activ-ity in dose-dependent manner. The immunoblotting showedthat MMP-2 protein level was gradually decreased alongwith the concentration of DNE3 (Figure 5(c)). Physiologicalactivity of MMP-2 is greatly related to that of their specificendogenous inhibitors, TIMP-2, therefore western blottingwas employed to see the effect of DNE3 on TIMP-2expression, and results showed that TIMP-2 protein levelswere significantly increased along with the concentration ofDNE3 in B16F10 (Figure 5(d)).3.6. The Inhibition of Akt Phosphorylation by DNE3. Theimmunoblotting showed that PI3K protein level was grad-ually decreased along with the concentration of DNE3(Figure 6(a)). DNE3 significantly inhibited the activation ofAkt as evidenced by a decrease in the levels of phospho-Aktproteins in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6(b)) whereasit has no significant effect on p38 and ERK1/2 activity(Figures 6(c) and 6(d)).3.7. Effects of DNE3 on the Activation of NF-\u03baB, c-Jun, and c-Fos. To examine the effect of DNE3 on the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1, B16F10 cells were treated with DNE3 for 24hours. Nuclear extract was analyzed by EMSA for AP-1 andNF-\u03baB DNA binding activity, and results showed that DNAbinding activity of NF-\u03baB (Figure 7(a)) was significantlyinhibited by a treatment with 100 \u03bcg/mL DNE3 whereas theAP-1 activity was unchanged (Figure 7(b)). Subsequently,western blot was performed to further confirm these results,and it was found that a pretreatment of DNE3 suppressed thenuclear levels of NF-\u03baB while it has no significant effect onthe c-Jun and c-Fos expression, with C23 being the internalcontrol (Figure 7(c)). The activity of NF-\u03baB is related tothat of their endogenous inhibitors, IkappaB (I\u03baB), thereforeWestern blotting was employed to see the effect of DNE3 onI\u03baB expression, and results showed that I\u03baB protein levelswere significantly increased along with the concentration ofDNE3 (Figure 7(d)).3.8. DNE3 Inhibit Invasion and MMP-2 and u-PA Secretionin Human Melanoma Cell Lines. Similar experiments wereperformed, using human melanoma cells, A2058, in order todetermine if the anti-invasive activity of DNE3 can generallybe applicable to other types of melanoma cells. DNE3inhibited the motility (Figures 8(a) and 8(c)) and invasion(Figures 8(b) and 8(d)) of A2058 cell lines, and DNE3 clearlyinhibited the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 (Figure 8(e)),and u-PA (Figure 8(f)), thus indicating that DNE3 mighthave anti-invasive properties against a broad spectrum ofmelanoma cells.4. Discussion and ConclusionsChemopreventive properties have long been attributed tophenolic compounds present in the human diet and arethe use of agents to delay, inhibit, or reverse tumorigenesis.These natural substances are of interest as they are potentialsources of anticancer compounds with minimal debilitatingtoxicity and side effects [19\u201321]. In the present study,we demonstrated that Dioscorea nipponica are effective invarious aspects of tumor formation in the B16F10 mousemelanoma model in vitro. This model was chosen on thebasis of aggressive behavior and high metastatic potentialof this cell line. One day after the intravenous injection oftumor cells, mice were treated with daily oral administration12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicineof the DNE3 and resulted in a significant, dose-dependentdelay in lung colonization.The metastatic process comprises a series of complicatedevents that can be subdivided into a number of steps involv-ing cell motility, cell invasion, surface adhesion properties,and degradation of ECM. Thus, in the present study, we triedto investigate the antimetastatic activity of DNE3 associatedwith tumor thrombosis by tumor cell invasion, migration,adhesion, and proteinase expression.Adhesive interaction of tumor cells to ECM and its inva-sive action into ECM are known to be fundamental eventsin tumor metastatic process [22]. Here, DNE3 inhibited theadhesion of B16-F10 cells to type I collagen, one of the ECMcomponents, as well as effectively suppressed the invasion ofB16-F10 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.The secretion of extracellular proteases plays an impor-tant role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis [23]. Ofthese proteases, MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent ECM-degrading enzymes, are involved in invasion, migration,and angiogenesis in tumor cells. There have been reportssuggesting that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9correlates with the progression of various types of tumors[24]. In addition to MMPs, the serine protease u-PAconverts inactive plasminogen into plasmin and thereforeplays a key role to initiate a cascade of proteolytic stepsaccumulating in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.u-PA is found in cellular structures at the leading edge ofmigrating cells that are involved in cell adhesion, migration,invasion, and metastatsis [25]. MMP-2 is a proteolyticenzyme capable of degrading the structural support networkfor normal and malignant cells, and their expression andactivity against matrix macromolecules have been shownto overbalance their endogenous inhibitors. TIMP-2 hasbeen shown to suppress tumor growth and metastaticpotential in cell and animal model systems [26]. Thedata presented here demonstrated that DNE3 inhibits theinvasion of melanoma cancer cells and this inhibitory activityappeared to be dependent on the decreased expression ofMMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA, while that of TIMP-2 wasenhanced.The role of PI3K-Akt and MAPKs pathways in theregulation of u-PA or MMPs expressions in carcinomacells has been well studied [23]. It has been shown thatan inhibition of p-Akt may lead to a reduction in theexpression of MMP-2 or u-PA as well as in the invasionof tumor cells. As shown in Figure 6, DNE3 could redusethe phosphorylation of Akt in B16-F10 cells. To make alinkage between p-Akt and protease expressions, the effectsof DNE3 on several transcription factors were examined. Itis well known that the activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03baB andthe downstream of the PI3K-Akt pathway are associated withinflammation, cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis[27], and that suppression of any of these transcriptionfactors is potentially an effective means to block tumorinvasion or metastasis, as well as blocking the factors thatbind to these regulatory elements, and therefore representsan appropriate approach to inhibit the synthesis of MMPs oru-PA. In our studies, DNE3 was found to effectively suppressthe DNA binding activity and the expression of NF-\u03baB whilethe protein level of I\u03baB, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, was gradually increased along with the concentration ofDNE3.The major drawbacks of many effective cancer chemo-therapeutic agents are systemic toxicity and drug resistance.In this regard, dietary supplement as well as phytotherapeuticagents with high anticancer activity and less toxicity tonormal tissues has been suggested as possible candidatesfor their capability to improve the efficacy of anticancerdrugs [28, 29]. In the present study, HS68, human foreskinfibroblast cells, was used to demonstrate that DNE3 exertedno cytotoxicity on normal foreskin fibroblast cells. Inconclusion, Dioscorea nipponica potently inhibits melanomainvasive and metastatic potential; therefore, they may consti-tute a valuable tool in the combination therapy of metastaticmelanoma and in the prevention of melanoma metastases.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by Grants of the National ScienceCouncil, Taiwan (NSC 98-2313-B-166-004-MY3 and NSC98-2313-B-040-004-MY3).
