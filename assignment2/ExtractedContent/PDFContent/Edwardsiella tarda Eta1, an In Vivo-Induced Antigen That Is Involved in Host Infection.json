"Edwardsiella tarda Eta1, an In Vivo-Induced Antigen That Is Involvedin Host InfectionYun Sun,a,c Wen-Jiang Zheng,a,b,c Yong-Hua Hu,a Bo-Guang Sun,a and Li SunaKey Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, Chinaa; Lanzhou Branch, National Science Library,Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu, Chinab; and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, ChinacEdwardsiella tarda, a Gram-negative bacterium, is a severe fish pathogen that can also infect humans. In this study, we identi-fied, via in vivo-induced antigen technology, an E. tarda antigen, Eta1, and analyzed its function in a Japanese flounder(Paralichthys olivaceus) model. Eta1 is composed of 226 residues and shares homology with putative bacterial adhesins. Quanti-tative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that when cultured in vitro, eta1 expression was growth phasedependent and reached maximum at mid-logarithmic phase. During infection of flounder lymphocytes, eta1 expression wasdrastically increased at the early stage of infection. Compared to the wild type, the eta1-defective mutant, TXeta1, was unaffectedin growth but exhibited attenuated overall virulence, reduced tissue dissemination and colonization capacity, and impaired abil-ity to invade flounder lymphocytes and to block the immune response of host cells. The lost virulence of TXeta1 was restoredwhen a functional eta1 gene was reintroduced into the strain. Western blot and immunodetection analyses showed that Eta1 islocalized to the outer membrane and exposed on the surface of E. tarda and that recombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was able to interactwith flounder lymphocytes. Consistent with these observations, antibody blocking of Eta1 inhibited E. tarda infection at thecellular level. Furthermore, when used as a subunit vaccine, rEta1 induced strong protective immunity in flounder against lethalE. tarda challenge. Taken together, these results indicate that Eta1 is an in vivo-induced antigen that mediates pathogen-hostinteraction and, as a result, is required for optimal bacterial infection.Edwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bac-terium of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is a pathogen with abroad host range that includes fish, birds, reptiles, and humans. E.tarda infection of humans can cause gastrointestinal symptomsand other disorders, such as myonecrosis and wound infections(9, 21). In aquaculture, E. tarda is considered a severe pathogenbecause of its ability to infect a wide range of marine and freshwa-ter fish, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), tur-bot (Scophtalmus maximus), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), eels(Anguilla japonica), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) (17,37). E. tarda infection of fish may lead to the development of asystemic disease called edwardsiellosis, which in Japanese floun-der is often manifested in hemorrhage, septicemia, skin lesions,and necrosis of liver, gut, and kidney (19, 26).Functional studies have identified a number of E. tarda systemsand factors that are involved in pathogenesis (14, 24). It is knownthat E. tarda enters host fish through the gastrointestinal tract, thegills, and the body surface and is able to resist the immune defensemediated by host complements and phagocytes (16, 23). Studiesin fish models, such as blue gourami and flounder, have indicatedthat effective E. tarda infection requires two virulence-associatedsystems, i.e., type III (T3SS) and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems,which are vital to E. tarda invasion and intracellular replication(22, 35, 42, 46). Other factors known to be involved in E. tardapathogenicity are hemolysin (8, 29, 40, 41), catalase (25), super-oxide dismutase (4), heat shock proteins (5, 6), Dps (47), and theLuxS/AI-2 quorum-sensing system (43, 44). A recent study basedon genomic subtractive hybridization identified an autotrans-porter adhesin, AIDA, in atypical strains of fish-pathogenic E.tarda (27). However, the precise functions of these virulence fac-tors during E. tarda infection and the mechanism of disease oc-currence are unclear.In previous studies, we have utilized the approach of in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to discover potential viru-lence factors associated with E. tarda infection (10, 11). In thecurrent study, we examined the biological properties and functionof a putative adhesin, Eta1, identified via IVIAT. We found thatexpression of eta1 was drastically enhanced during infection ofhost cells and that mutation of eta1 attenuates E. tarda virulence atthe cellular and tissue levels. In addition, we also observed inter-action between recombinant Eta1 and host lymphocytes, andblocking of this interaction inhibits the infectivity of E. tarda.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and growth conditions. E. coli BL21, BL21(DE3), andDH5\ufffd were purchased from Tiangen (Beijing, China). E. coli S17-1\ufffdpirwas purchased from Biomedal (Sevilla, Spain). E. tarda TX01 was isolatedfrom the kidneys of diseased flounder (31) and is naturally resistant torifampin. All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (28) at 37\u00b0C(for E. coli) or 28\u00b0C (for E. tarda). Where indicated, appropriate antibiot-ics were supplemented as follows: chloramphenicol, 30 \ufffdg/ml; polymyxinB, 100 \ufffdg/ml; and rifampin, 20 \ufffdg/ml. All antibiotics were purchasedfrom Sangon, Shanghai, China.Fish used for infection study.

The putative amino acidsequence of Eta1 was analyzed using the BLAST program at the NationalCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Expert ProteinAnalysis System. Domain search was performed with the conserved do-main search program of NCBI. The signal peptide search was performedwith SignalP 3.0. The theoretical molecular mass and theoretical isoelec-tric point were predicted using EditSeq in the DNASTAR software pack-age (Madison, WI).Preparation of flounder HK lymphocytes. To prepare flounder headkidney (HK) lymphocytes, HK was removed from three flounder (averageweight, 796 g) under aseptic conditions and washed 3 times with phos-phate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 U of penicillin and strepto-mycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China). The tissue was passed through a metalmesh, and the cell suspension was overlaid on 1.070 and 1.077 discontin-uous density of Percoll solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After centrif-ugation at 300 \ufffd g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the interface fraction containinglymphocytes was collected and washed 3 times with PBS. The lymphocyteswere resuspended in L-15 medium (Thermo Scientific HyClone, Beijing,China), and the viability of the cells was examined by the trypan blue dyeexclusion method. The cells were adjusted to 2 \ufffd 105 viable cells/ml inL-15, distributed into 96-well tissue culture plates, and cultured at 22\u00b0C.qRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression. To examine eta1 expression inLB medium, E. tarda TX01 was grown in LB medium at 28\u00b0C to opticaldensities at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5. The cells wereharvested by centrifugation and used for total RNA extraction with an HPTotal RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek). One microgram of total RNA was usedfor cDNA synthesis with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out as described previously (48) in an Eppendorf Mas-tercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the SYBR ExScriptqRT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with 16S rRNA as a reference, asdescribed previously (43). The PCR primers for eta1 were RT-F1 (5=-GTCAGGAAAGTGATTGGTGGC-3=) and RT-R1 (5=-TCCAATACTCCTTCTCGGTGC-3=). The PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene were 16S933F(5=-GCACAAGCGGTGGAGCAT-3=) and 16SRTR2 (5=-GCCATGCAGCACCTGTCTC-3=). The PCR analysis was performed four times. All dataare given in terms of relative mRNA expressed as means plus or minusstandard errors of the means (SE).To examine eta1 expression during infection of host cells, TX01 wascultured in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.8; the cells were collected bycentrifugation and resuspended in PBS to 107 CFU/ml. For cellular infec-tion, TX01 (106 CFU/well) was added to HK lymphocytes cultured in96-well culture plates (105 cells/well) or, as controls, to 96-well cultureplates containing L-15 medium without lymphocytes. The plates wereincubated at 25\u00b0C for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h at 25\u00b0C. After theincubation, the plates containing lymphocytes were washed 3 times withPBS to remove unattached bacteria, and the cells were then used for totalRNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression as describedabove. The TX01 in the control plates was collected by centrifugation andused for total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis as described above.Plasmid and strain construction. To construct pEtEta1, which ex-presses eta1, eta1 was amplified by PCR with primers 81F1 (5=-CGCATATGGAGAATAATTTACTCGGCGA-3= [underlined sequence, NdeI site])and 81R1 (5=-CTCGAGTTCCCCCACTTCCTTATTTCT-3= [underlinedsequence, XhoI site]); the PCR products were ligated with the T-A cloningvector pBS-T (Tiangen, Beijing, China), resulting in pBSEta1, which wasdigested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragment containing eta1 was retrievedand inserted into pET258 (32) between NdeI and XhoI sites. To constructthe eta1-defective strain TXeta1, an internal fragment of eta1 (positions 67to 303) was generated by PCR with primers KOF1 (5=-GGATCCGCACAATCCTAGAATCAGTA-3= [underlined sequence, BamHI site]) andKOR1 (5=-GGATCCTAACTTCCATTGGCTATCT-3= [underlined se-quence, BamHI site]). The PCR products were inserted into the suicideplasmid pDM4 (18) at the compatible BglII site, resulting in pDMEta1.S17-1\ufffdpir was transformed with pDMEta1, and the transformants wereconjugated with TX01 as described previously (43). The transconjugantswere selected on LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B andchloramphenicol. One of the selected mutants was named TXeta1. Muta-tion of eta1 in TXeta1 was confirmed by PCR analysis and subsequentsequencing of the PCR products and by Western blot analysis. To con-struct TXeta1C, pBSEta1 was digested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragmentcontaining eta1 was retrieved and inserted into the expression plasmidpBT3 (45) between NdeI and XhoI sites, resulting in pBT3Eta1. TXeta1was transformed with pBT3Eta1 via electroporation, and the transfor-mants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (re-sistance marker of pBT3Eta1). One of the transformants was namedTXeta1C.Purification of recombinant protein and preparation of antiserum.Recombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was purified as follows. E. coli BL21(DE3) wastransformed with pEtEta1; the transformants were cultured in LB me-dium at 37\u00b0C to mid-logarithmic phase, and expression of eta1 was in-duced by adding isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a finalconcentration of 1 mM. After growing at 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 h, thecells were harvested by centrifugation, and His-tagged rEta1 was purifiedunder native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (GEHealthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as recommended by the manufacturer. Thepurified protein was dialyzed in PBS and concentrated with Amicon UltraCentrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentratedprotein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized after staining with Coomassiebrilliant blue R-250. The concentration of the protein was determinedusing the Bradford method (3) with bovine serum albumin as the stan-dard. Preparation of rat anti-rEta1 serum and determination of the titersand specificities of anti-rEta1 antibodies were performed as describedpreviously (32).Determination of the subcellular location of Eta1. (i) Western blot-ting. TX01 and TXeta1 were grown in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.5 andharvested by centrifugation at 6,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Extracellularproteins were prepared by concentrating the supernatant 100 times usingAmicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cyto-plasmic and periplasmic proteins were prepared as reported previously(45). To prepare outer membrane proteins, the cell pellet was washed 3times with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold buffer I (50 mM Tris \u00b7 Cl, 1mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The cells were broken by sonication on ice, followedby centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was collected andcentrifuged at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothre-itol (DTT), and 2% Sarkosyl and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with mixingevery 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C,and the pellet was resuspended in buffer I. The concentration of the pu-rified proteins was determined using the Bradford method (3). Westernblotting was performed as follows. The proteins were subjected to electro-phoresis in 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, theproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membraneswere blocked for 3 h with 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)-0.1%(wt/vol) azide-PBS containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (PBS-T), fol-lowed by washing with PBS-T three times. The blocked membranes wereincubated for 2 h with antiserum against rEta1 or antiserum against re-combinant LuxS (rLuxS), an intracellular protein of E. tarda (43). Theantisera were diluted in PBS-T containing 2% (wt/vol) BSA to 1/500. Themembranes were washed three times with PBS-T. Primary antibodieswere detected by incubating the membranes with anti-rat IgG-horserad-ish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Tiangen, Beijing, China) (1/1,000 dilu-tion in PBS-T) for 1 h in PBS-T\u2013BSA. The membranes were washed threetimes with PBS-T, and the antibody was detected with the HRP-DAB kit(Tiangen, Beijing, China). The color reaction was stopped after 30 min byseveral washes with water, and the membranes were air dried.An E. tarda Antigen Involved in Host InfectionAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2949http://iai.asm.org(ii) immunofluorescence study. TX01 and TXeta1 were cultured inLB medium to an OD600 of 0.5. The cells were washed and diluted in PBSto 108 CFU/ml. Three hundred microliters of bacterial suspension wasdropped onto a glass slide, and the slide was incubated at room tempera-ture for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,followed by washing 3 times with PBS. Rat anti-rEta1 serum, preimmuneserum, and rat anti-rLuxS serum were diluted 500 times in PBS, and 300\ufffdl diluted serum was added to the bacterial cells on the slide. The slide wasincubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h and washed 3 times with PBS. Fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China) wasdiluted 1,000 times, and 300 \ufffdl of the diluted antibody was added to theslide. The slide was incubated and washed as described above and ob-served with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon E800; Japan).Tissue dissemination and mortality analysis. For tissue dissemina-tion analysis, TXeta1, TXeta1C, and TX01 were cultured in LB medium toan OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended inseawater. Japanese flounder were divided randomly into four groups (n \ufffd35) and immersed in seawater containing or not containing (control) 108CFU/ml of TXeta1, TXeta1C, or TX01. The blood, liver, kidney, andspleen were taken aseptically from the fish (five from each group) at 12 hpostinfection. Bacterial recovery from the tissues was determined as re-ported previously (43). The rest of the infected fish were monitored dailyfor mortality for 20 days.E. tarda infection of host cells and bacterial-recovery analysis. Toexamine E. tarda infection, TXeta1 and TX01 were cultured in LB me-dium to an OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended inL-15 to 107 CFU/ml. HK lymphocytes cultured in 96-well cell cultureplates were supplemented with TXeta1 or TX01 (106 CFU/well). Theplates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h, followed by washing3 times with PBS. The cells were incubated with penicillin and streptomy-cin (100 U) for 2 h at 25\u00b0C to kill extracellular bacteria. Bacterial recoverywas determined as reported previously (43). The experiment was per-formed four times.qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of immune genes in E. tarda-infected flounder. Flounder were infected with TXeta1 or TX01 as de-scribed above for tissue dissemination analysis. Total RNA was extractedfrom HK at 1 h and 4 h postinfection with an HP Total RNA kit (OmegaBio-Tek) and used for qRT-PCR as described above with 18S rRNA andubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCE) as internal references (48). Theprimers used to amplify the genes of interleukin 1\ufffd (IL-1\ufffd), IL-6, IL-8,gamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\ufffd), inter-feron-induced Mx protein (Mx), major histocompatibility complex(MHC) class I\ufffd, CD40, and CD8\ufffd have been reported previously (12).Interaction between rEta1 and flounder lymphocytes. Flounder HKlymphocytes (\ufffd105) were placed onto a glass slide, and the slide wasincubated at room temperature for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by washing 3 times with PBS.Three hundred microliters of 10 \ufffdM rEta1 or recombinant EthR, an in-tracellular protein of E. tarda (40), was added to the lymphocytes, fol-lowed by incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. After the incubation, the slide waswashed 3 times with PBS and supplemented with 300 \ufffdl of 1/1,000 mouseanti-His antibody (Bioss, Beijing, China) or serum from an unvaccinatedmouse (negative-control serum). The slide was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 hand washed as described above, followed by adding 300 \ufffdl of 1/1,000FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China). The slide wasincubated and washed as described above and observed with a fluores-cence microscope (Nikon E800, Japan). The ability of anti-His antibodyto react with rEthR was demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).Effect of anti-Eta1 antibodies on E. tarda infection. TX01 was di-luted in PBS to 108 CFU/ml. Anti-Eta1 serum and preimmune serum werediluted 1,000 times, 500 times, and 100 times in PBS. TX01 suspensionwas mixed with each of the diluted sera at an equal volume, followed byincubation at room temperature for 0.5 h. As a control, TX01 was mixedand incubated in the same manner with an equal volume of PBS. After theincubation, the TX01-containing mixture was added to flounder HK lym-phocytes cultured in 96-well cell culture plates as described above (5 \ufffd 105CFU bacterial cells/well). The plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 h, fol-lowed by washing 3 times with PBS. The number of bacterial cells associ-ated with lymphocytes was determined as described above by plate count.The assay was performed four times.Vaccination. rEta1 was resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 200\ufffdg/ml and mixed at an equal volume with aluminum hydroxide as de-scribed previously (12). As a control, PBS was also mixed similarly withaluminum hydroxide without rEta1 (PBS-aluminum hydroxide). Floun-der (as described above) were divided randomly into two groups (n \ufffd 35)and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 \ufffdl of rEta1 suspension orPBS-aluminum hydroxide (control). At 1 month postvaccination, 25 fishwere taken from each group and challenged via i.p. injection with 100 \ufffdlTX01 that had been cultured as described above to an OD600 of 0.8,washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 \ufffd 106 CFU/ml. The fishwere monitored for mortality for a period of 20 days. Dying fish (5 fromthe PBS-injected group and 3 from the rEta1-vaccinated group) wereexamined for bacterial recovery from liver, kidney, and spleen as de-scribed above (see \u201cTissue dissemination and mortality analysis\u201d). Therelative percent survival (RPS) was calculated according to the followingformula: RPS \ufffd [1 \t (percent mortality in vaccinated fish/percent mor-tality in control fish)] \ufffd 100 (1). The vaccination trial was conducted induplicate.ELISA. Sera were taken from vaccinated fish and control fish at 4weeks postvaccination and diluted 20-fold in PBS. Serum antibodyagainst rEta1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) analysis as described previously (34).Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) of the SPSS 15.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Inall cases, the significance level was defined as a P value of  0.05.Nucleotide sequence accession number. The nucleotide sequence ofeta1 has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numberJN802138.RESULTSCharacterization of the sequence of Eta1. The deduced aminoacid sequence of Eta1 contains 226 amino acid residues and ispredicted to have a molecular mass of 23.6 kDa and an isoelectricpoint of 4.7. In silico analysis identified no apparent conserveddomain in Eta1. No putative signal peptide sequence was found inEta1. BLAST analysis showed that Eta1 shares the highest se-quence identities (60% and 53%, respectively) with the C-termi-nal 217-residue region of the putative adhesins of Erwinia sp.strain Ejp617 (GenBank accession no. ADP11523) and Escherichiacoli strain CL3 serovar O113:H21 pathogenicity island I (GenBankaccession no. AAQ19127). These data suggest the possibility thatEta1 is a novel type of adhesin.eta1 expression under in vitro conditions and during infec-tion. To examine eta1 expression under in vitro conditions, E.tarda TX01 was cultured in LB medium to OD600 of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9,1.25, and 1.5, and eta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR.The results showed that eta1 expression peaked at an OD600 of 0.5and dropped afterward, reaching the lowest level at OD600 of 1.25and 1.5 (Fig. 1A). Compared to the expression level at an OD600 of0.25, which, for convenience of comparison, was set as 1, the ex-pression levels at OD600 of 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5 were 2.3-, 0.7-,0.5-, and 0.5-fold, respectively. To examine eta1 expression duringinfection, flounder HK lymphocytes were infected with TX01, andeta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h,and 5 h postinfection. The results showed that, compared to eta1expression before infection (0 h), eta1 expression after infectionwas significantly induced and reacheda maximum (69-fold) at 1 hSun et al.2950 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=JN802138http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=ADP11523http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=AAQ19127http://iai.asm.orgpostinfection (Fig. 1B). The eta1 expression level dropped as in-fection progressed but remained significantly higher at 2 h and 3 hpostinfection than before infection. In contrast, in TX01 incu-bated under the same conditions but without host cells, no appar-ent alteration in eta1 expression was observed at all the examinedtime points.Subcellular localization of Eta1. To examine the subcellularlocalization of Eta1, TX01 was cultured in LB medium to an OD600of 0.5, which, as shown above, is the growth point at which arelatively high level of eta1 expression was observed. Proteins wereprepared from the cytoplasm, periplasm, outer membrane, andextracellular fractions of the culture and subjected to Western blotanalysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinantEta1 (rEta1), which was prepared as a His-tagged protein from E.coli (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The results showedthat Eta1 was found in the preparations of the cytoplasm,periplasm, and outer membrane proteins but not in that of theextracellular proteins (Fig. 2A and B). To examine whether theouter membrane preparation had been contaminated with cyto-plasmic proteins, the preparations of the outer membrane andcytoplasmic proteins were blotted with antibodies against recom-binant LuxS (rLuxS), a cytoplasmic protein of E. tarda (43). Theresults showed that LuxS was detected in the cytoplasmic prepa-ration but not in the outer membrane preparation (Fig. 2C), sug-gesting that the outer membrane faction was not contaminatedwith cytoplasmic proteins. These results indicated that the Eta1observed in the outer membrane preparation was most likely dueto natural outer membrane localization. To further examinewhether Eta1 was exposed on the cell surface, TX01 was incubatedwith rat anti-rEta1 serum or preimmune serum, and the boundantibodies were detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-rat IgG.Subsequent microscopic examination showed that fluorescencewas detected in TX01 treated with anti-rEta1 serum, but not inTX01 treated with preimmune serum (Fig. 3). In contrast, TX01treated with antibodies against rLuxS failed to show fluorescence.These results suggest that Eta1 was exposed on the surface of E.tarda and able to interact with anti-rEta1 antibodies.Effect of eta1 mutation. (i) Effect on tissue dissemination andgeneral bacterial virulence. To examine the biological impor-tance of Eta1, a genetic variant of TX01, TXeta1, which bears aninsertion mutation at eta1, was constructed. Western blot analysisshowed that, unlike the wild type, TXeta1 was unable to produceEta1 (Fig. 2B). Compared to the wild-type strain TX01, TXeta1was unaffected in growth when cultured in LB medium. To exam-ine whether the eta81 mutation affected pathogenicity, flounderwere infected via immersion with or without (control) TXeta1 orTX01, and bacterial infection of host tissues was analyzed by bac-terial-recovery analysis, which showed that at 12 h postinfection,the numbers of bacterial cells recovered from the blood, liver,kidney, and spleen of TXeta1-infected fish were significantly lessthan those recovered from TX01-infected fish (Fig. 4A). No bac-teria were recovered from the control fish. These results suggestthat TXeta1 was impaired in its ability to disseminate into andcolonize host tissues. Furthermore, in TX01-infected fish, mortal-ity began to occur at 3 days postinfection, and 90% accumulatedmortality was reached before the fish became stabilized, whereas inTXeta1-infected fish, no mortality was observed (Fig. 4B). In contrastto TXeta1, TXeta1C, a variant of TXeta1 that expresses eta1 in transfrom a plasmid, was able to disseminate into and colonize floundertissues and to cause mortality in the infected fish in a manner similarto that of TX01 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the defect in the virulence ofTXeta1 could be rescued by eta1 complementation.(ii) Effect on infection of host cells and on cellular immuneresponse. To examine the effect of eta1 mutation on the infectivityFIG 1 Expression of eta1 under different conditions. (A) E. tarda TX01 wascultured in LB medium to OD600 of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5, and expressionof eta1 was determined by qRT-PCR. The expression level at an OD600 of 0.25was set as 1. (B) TX01 was incubated with or without (control) flounder headkidney lymphocytes for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h, and eta1 expression inlymphocyte-associated TX01 and control TX01 was determined by qRT-PCR.The expression level of eta1 at 0 h of infection was set as 1.

The results showed that bacterial recovery rates fromTXeta1-infected cells at all the examined time points were sig-nificantly lower than those from TX01-infected cells (Fig. 5).qRT-PCR analysis of immune gene expression in flounder HKat 1 h and 4 h after TXeta1 and TX01 infection showed that,compared to TX01, which is known to inhibit the host immuneresponse, TXeta1 infection induced a significant increase in theexpression of IL-1\ufffd, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\ufffd, IFN-\ufffd, Mx, MHCI\ufffd,CD8\ufffd, and CD40 in a manner that was dependent on the in-fection time (Fig. 6).Binding of recombinant rEta1 to flounder lymphocytes.Since Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein and its production is re-quired for effective infection of host cells, we wondered whetherEta1 was capable of direct interaction with host cells. To investi-gate this question, the His-tagged rEta1 or rEthR, an intracellularE. tarda protein prepared under the same conditions as those un-der which rEta1 was prepared, was incubated with flounder HKlymphocytes, and the cells were subsequently subjected to fluores-cence immunodetection with anti-His antibody or serum from anunvaccinated mouse (control serum). The results showed that forcells treated with anti-His antibody, fluorescence was detected incells preincubated with rEta1, but not in cells preincubated withrEthR (Fig. 7). In contrast, for cells treated with the control serum,FIG 3 Exposure of Eta1 on the surface of E. tarda.

To fur-ther examine whether the interaction between Eta1 and host cellswas required for bacterial infection, flounder HK lymphocyteswere infected with TX01 in the presence or absence of anti-rEta1serum or preimmune serum in different dilutions. The resultsshowed that the presence of anti-rEta1 serum significantly re-duced the number of bacterial cells that invaded lymphocytes in amanner that was dependent on the dose of the antiserum (Fig. 8).In contrast, the presence of preimmune serum had no effect oncellular infection.Immunoprotective potential of rEta1. The above results, i.e.,that Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein that is highly induced dur-ing infection and interacts directly with host cells, led us to wonderwhether rEta1 could induce protective immunity if used as a vac-cine. To examine this possibility, flounder were vaccinated withrEta1 and challenged with a lethal dose of TX01 at 4 weeks post-vaccination. The fish were subsequently monitored for mortalityfor 20 days, and the results showed that the accumulated mortal-ities of rEta1-vaccinated fish and the control fish were 12% and72%, respectively. Hence, the protective efficacy, in terms of RPS,of rEta1 was 83.3%. Comparable results were obtained in the du-plicate vaccination trial. Microbiological examination of dyingfish indicated that TX01 was the only type of bacterium recoveredfrom the liver, spleen, and blood of the fish, suggesting that mor-tality was caused by TX01 infection. ELISA analysis showed thatspecific serum antibodies were produced in rEta1-vaccinated fish(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). These results indicatethat rEta1 is a protective antigen.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the function of an in vivo-induced an-tigen, Eta1, from the pathogenic E. tarda strain TX01 isolatedfrom diseased flounder. Expression analysis showed that whenTX01 was cultured under in vitro conditions in the rich LB me-dium, the eta1 expression level changed with the growth phase.However, the magnitude of the change was relatively small, as thepeak expression level was only 4.6-fold that of the bottom level. Incontrast, expression of eta1 was significantly induced during in-fection of host lymphocytes, particularly at the early stage of in-FIG 6 Effect of TXeta1 and TX01 infection on the expression of immunegenes.

These results indicate that eta1 expression is strongly in-duced during the process of host cell invasion, which is consistentwith the identification of Eta1 as an in vivo-induced antigen in thefirst place, and they suggest a potential involvement of Eta1 in hostinfection.To examine whether Eta1 was required for E. tarda pathogen-esis, an Eta1-deficient mutant, TXeta1, was constructed. TXeta1was comparable to the wild type in growth when cultured in LBmedium, suggesting that Eta1 is not an essential protein during invitro growth. It is known that E. tarda possesses a strong tissueinvasion and dissemination capacity that enables the pathogen toovercome the innate immunity barrier and eventually reach theinternal organs of the host (16, 33). In this study, we found thatfollowing immersion infection of flounder, both TXeta1 andTX01 were able to spread to the liver and spleen; however, thenumbers of TXeta1 bacteria recovered from these tissues weremore than 10-fold less than those of recovered TX01, suggestingthat mutation of eta1 impairs the ability of TXeta1 to disseminateinto and colonize host tissues. Consistent with these observations,TX01 infection induced 90% accumulated mortality, while nomortality was observed in TXeta1-infected fish. These results in-dicate that TXeta1 was attenuated in overall virulence. The obser-vation that introduction of a functional eta1 gene into TXeta1restored the virulence of TXeta1 suggests that the virulence atten-uation of TXeta1 was indeed due to eta1 mutation. In agreementwith these observations made in a live-fish model, cellular-infec-tion analysis showed that, compared to TX01, TXeta1 exhibitedsignificantly reduced ability to invade host lymphocytes.Previous studies have shown that one of the prominent viru-lence features of E. tarda is its capacity to interfere with the normalimmune response of host phagocytes, and this capacity is essentialto the intracellular survival of E. tarda (23, 47). In this study, wefound that the expression profiles of the immune genes in TX01-and TXeta1-infected flounder HK differed remarkably. Com-pared to TX01, TXeta1 stimulated the expression of a wide spec-trum of immune genes that are involved in proinflammatory andspecific immune responses, which probably accounts for the re-sistance of the host to TXeta1 infection. Hence, it appears thatunlike the wild-type TX01, the eta1-defective mutant TXeta1 is nolonger able to inhibit the general immune response of the host.Accumulating studies have indicated that for many humanpathogens, adhesins play a vital role in infection by mediating hostcell adhesion and invasion (7, 15, 20, 30, 36). These proteins bindto receptors on the surfaces of host cells, thereby facilitating bac-terial translocation into the targeted cells (13). In our study, wefound that recombinant Eta1 was localized to the cell surface.Since no apparent signal peptide was identified in Eta1, it is pos-sible that translocation of Eta1 may be through a nonclassicalpathway. Eta1 was able to interact with flounder lymphocytes,which, together with the observation that Eta1 expression wasupregulated during lymphocyte infection, suggests a possibilityfor Eta1 to act as an adhesin. Consistent with this hypothesis, thepresence of anti-rEta1 antibodies reduced TX01 invasion intolymphocytes. Since preimmune serum had no effect on TX01 in-fection, it is likely that the reduced infectivity of TX01 observedin the presence of anti-rEta1 antibodies is due to specific bindingof the antibodies to Eta1 on the pathogen, which may have maskedthe region of Eta1 that is essential to host cell interaction.It is known that in some bacterial pathogens, surface proteins,such as invasins, that are involved in direct interactions with thehost system possess vaccine properties (2, 38, 39). In our study, wefound that rEta1 induced a protection rate of 83.3% upon lethal E.tarda challenge, suggesting that rEta1 is a strong protective im-munogen. The immunoprotective property of rEta1 is in line withits virulence role played during infection. It is likely that, as shownby ELISA analysis, vaccination of rEta1 induced production ofspecific antibodies, which upon E. tarda infection bind to the in-fected pathogen via Eta1, which is highly expressed in vivo andlocalized on the cell surface. Since Eta1 is essential to effective hostcell infection, binding of Eta1 by its antibodies very likely inter-feres with the normal function of Eta1, as was observed under invitro conditions with flounder lymphocytes, resulting in a markedelevation in the survival rate of the vaccinated fish.In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Eta1 is an invivo-induced antigen that is highly expressed upon encounteringthe host system during infection. With flounder as a model, it wasfound that mutation of eta1 reduces the ability of E. tarda to infecthost cells, disseminate into host tissues, and cause mortality of theinfected fish. Purified recombinant Eta1 is able to interact withflounder lymphocytes, and blocking this interaction inhibits cel-lular infection. Consistent with these observations, Eta1 inducesstrong immunoprotection in flounder when used as a subunitvaccine. These results suggest that Eta1 possibly functions as anadhesin during E. tarda infection and, as a result, is required foroptimal bacterial invasion.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (31025030), the Ministry of Science and Technology(2011AA10A216), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the ChineseAcademy of Sciences (KZCX2-EW-Q213), and the Taishan Scholar Pro-gram of Shandong Province.REFERENCES1.
