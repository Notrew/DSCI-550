The main clinical sign is the presence oferosive lesions that form on external surfaces. Theselesions are characterised by destruction of the epithelialcells and connective tissue, which leaves the musculatureexposed. Bacteria isolated from the leading edges of thelesions are slender, Gram-negative rods. The genus Tenac-ibaculum belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylumBacteriodetes and T. maritimum is an exclusively marinespecies (Bernardet et al.1996; Suzuki et al. 2001; Ludwiget al. 2008).Wakabayashi et al. (1986) first described T. maritimumas a fish pathogen after isolating it from red sea bream(Pagrus major) and black sea bream (Acanthopagrusschegeli) in Japan. Other susceptible fish species include:flounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) (Baxa et al. 1986) andyellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) (Baxa et al. 1988a) inJapan; Dover sole (Solea solea) (Bernardet et al. 1990) inScotland; sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) (Bernardet et al.1994) in France and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) inSpain (Alsina and Blanch 1993).In Tasmania, Australia, T. maritimum has been isolatedfrom Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), rainbow trout(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and striped trumpeter (Latrislineata) (Handlinger et al. 1997). The only severe out-break of the disease occurred during the summer of1988 \u2044 89.

The Tasmanian strains of T. maritimum appear relativelyhomogeneous physically, but antigenically different. All isolates were hydropho-bic and produce a variety of ECP profiles. There were two isolates that standout in all assays (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) and showed great variation from theother isolates. All isolates have been confirmed as T. maritimum.Conclusions: Based on the tests carried out three isolates were chosen forin vivo trials: 89/4747, 89/4762, 00/3280.Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characteriseT. maritimum isolates from Tasmanian waters. The opportunity to developvaccines for the Tasmanian salmonid aquaculture industry is enhanced by agreater understanding of the physical characteristics of pathogens.Journal of Applied Microbiology ISSN 1364-50721668 Journal of Applied Microbiology 109, 1668\u20131676 \u00aa 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology\u00aa 2010 The Authorsoutbreaks of marine flexibacteriosis within marine cages.Higher than average water temperatures (21\ufffdC), sunnycloudless days and poor feeding management were identi-fied as contributing factors to the outbreak (Handlingeret al. 1997). Control of the disease has been managed bychanging feeding practices, fish handling and the use ofantibiotics (Carson et al. 1992).However, there is limited information on the biologicalfactors that could initiate further outbreaks of the disease.Patterns of infection are variable and effective manage-ment strategies would be difficult to implement (Carsonet al. 1994). Antibiotics such as trimethoprim and amoxi-cillin have been utilised in the treatment of marine flexi-bacteriosis on Tasmanian salmonid farms (Cameron1991, 1993a,b), but are undesirable for prolonged usewith issues of bacterial resistance and tissue residencetimes. Therefore, development of a safe and effectivevaccine against T. maritimum in salmonids for theTasmanian salmonid aquaculture industry requires as afirst step a comparison of local isolates of T. maritimumto identify candidates for pathogenicity assessment andsubsequent vaccination experiments.Materials and methodsBacterial strainsEighteen T. maritimum isolates were cultured from skinlesions on Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in Tasma-nia from 1989 to 2001 (Table 1). Isolates were grown onmarine Shieh\u2019s agar, (MSA) (g l)1: peptone L37 (Oxoid,Adelaide, Australia), 5 g; yeast extract (Oxoid), 0\u00c65 g;sodium pyruvate (Oxoid), 0\u00c61 g; sodium acetate (Oxoid),0\u00c601 g; citric acid (Oxoid), 0\u00c601 g; distilled water, 100 ml;aged seawater, 900 ml; pH, 7\u00c65\u20137\u00c68), an adaptation of themedium of Shieh (Song et al. 1988). The isolates wereidentified by phenotype (Schmidtke et al. 1991) and con-firmed as T. maritimum by PCR using primers for the16S rRNA gene (Carson and Wilson 2003). Two addi-tional strains were used for comparison: the type strain ofT. maritimum (NCIMB 2154T) and a reference strainBaxa lyl-1 (Baxa et al. 1988a). Stock cultures were storedfrozen in peptone water with 8% glycerol (Ward andWatt 1971) at )80\ufffdC in single use cryovials. Bacteria weremaintained in culture on MSA at 25\ufffdC or in marineShieh\u2019s broth (MSB) at room temperature (20\ufffdC).Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT)All isolates were tested by IFAT as this technique wouldbe used later in other trials as a confirmatory test forT. maritimum. The procedure described by Carson et al.(1992) was used. Smears were produced using bacteriafrom plate culture that were then air-dried and heat fixed.The smears were overlaid with 40 ll of polyclonal rabbitantiserum to strain 89/0329-5 of T. maritimum diluted1 : 100 in PBS (pH 7\u00c62, 0\u00c61 mol l)1) and incubated in amoist chamber for 30 min at 37\ufffdC before rinsing in PBSfor 15 min. After the removal of excess buffer by blotting,20 ll of anti-rabbit FITC (Silenus, Melbourne) diluted1 : 60 in PBS was added to each slide. Smears were incu-bated at 37\ufffdC for 30 min and rinsed for 30 min in PBS,which was changed every 10 min. Slides were coverslipmounted using alkaline glycerol buffer (Johnson andMunday 1993) and examined at \u00b740 magnification withepifluorescent microscopy using UV illumination. A mar-ine Flavobacterium sp. (99 \u2044 1972-4b), isolated from Atlan-tic salmon, the primary antibody only and the anti-rabbitFITC only were used as negative controls. All isolateswere tested in triplicate.Whole cell protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles (LPS)Whole cell and LPS samples were prepared using a 48 hbroth culture. After harvesting, whole cell suspensionswere washed twice by centrifugation at 2900 g for 30 minand re-suspended in PBS (pH 7\u00c62). The suspensions wereonly washed twice because auto-agglutination occurred inmost isolates in subsequent washes or re-suspension. Eachsuspension was standardised to an absorbance of 1\u00c60 at550 nm in a spectrophotometer. Cells were collected fromaliquots of 1\u00c65 ml of suspension by centrifugation at6500 g for 3 min and the supernatant removed. Wholecell lysates were produced by resuspending the cell pelletin 500 ll of SDS solubilisation buffer (Laemmli 1970)and heating for 10 min at 100\ufffdC. Cell debris fromextracts were centrifuged at 6500 g for 3 min; the super-natant was removed and stored at )20\ufffdC.Lipopolysaccharide analysis was based on the method ofHitchcock and Brown (1983) with minor modifications.Cells were harvested at 16 500 g for 5 mins and sampleswere washed once in PBSA (0\u00c614 mol l)1 NaCl,0\u00c601 mol l)1 Na2HPO4, pH 7\u00c64, 1 mg of bovine serumalbumin per ml) and adjusted to 1 \u00b7 109 cell ml)1. The cellpellet was re-suspended in 100 ll of 2% SDS and mixedthoroughly. Glass beads (700\u20131200 lmol l)1 diameter,Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney) were added to break up the bacte-rial pellet as T. maritimum tended to form well bound cellaggregates. To assist solubilisation of the pellet, in additionto the glass beads, samples were heated to 60\ufffdC.Proteinase K (Boehringer-Mannheim, Sydney) at aconcentration of 20 mg ml)1 was added to each sampleto give a final concentration of 5 mg ml)1. Samples werethen incubated in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Sydney)for an hour at 60\ufffdC. The temperature was increased to99\ufffdC for 30 min, after which the samples were stored atR. van Gelderen et al.

Prior to loading, samples were thawed and mixedwith 134 ll of 2 \u00b7 SDS solubilisation buffer. Each samplewas heated in a water bath at 100\ufffdC for 10 mins and thencentrifuged at 16 000 g for 5 mins. Controls for LPSanalysis were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (positive) andLactococcus garvieae TCFB 0713 (negative).ECPsExtracellular products (ECPs) were produced by the cello-phane overlay method (Liu 1957). For each isolate, threeplates of MSA were incubated for 72 h at 25\ufffdC as thisyielded the greatest quantity of ECP. This also allowedminimal growth-phase effects as different proteases areproduced at different times of the growth curve(Gudmundsdo\u0301ttir 1996). After incubation, the culture waswashed off the cellophane with 1 ml of PBS (pH 7\u00c62) andcentrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min. The supernatant fluid(ECP) was filter sterilised (0\u00c622 lmol l)1 pore size) andstored in aliquots at )80\ufffdC. Protein content was deter-mined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method(Pierce Protein Research Products, Thermo Scientific,Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Duplicate cultures ofeach strain of bacteria to produce ECP were used toconfirm reproducibility of the results.Analysis of proteins and LPSECPs and whole cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli 1970) with a 5% stacking gel and 12%resolving gel. Samples were heated to 100\ufffdC for 10 minsprior to loading (10 ll). Electrophoresis was carried outfor 1 h at 40 mA and 200 V. Gels were stained with0\u00c6125% Coomassie Blue R-250.LPS was run on a NuPAGE\ufffd (Invitrogen, Melbourne,Australia) 12% Bis-Tris Gel for 1 h at 200 V. Gels weresilver stained according to the method of Tsai and Frasch(1982) but as this did not reveal banding, thereforeWestern blotting was used to detect LPS bands (Fig. 1).Western blots were run using the method of Towbinet al. (1979) with a single modification. As NuPAGE\ufffdBis-Tris gels were used, 10% methanol was added in thetransfer buffer instead of 20% methanol. LPS wastransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using anInvitrogen Novex (Melbourne) XCell II Blot Module(semi-dry transfer) for an hour at 30 V. After transfer, thenitrocellulose membranes were rinsed in PBSA and thenblocked for 30 mins with 3% skim milk powder in Tris-saline (Ab SM). Membranes were washed with Tris-salineand incubated for 30 mins with antisera against T. maritimum89/0329-5 in rabbit (dilution, 1 : 100) in Ab SM. Afterbeing washed twice in Tris-saline\u20130\u00c605% Tween 20, andonce in Tris-saline, the membranes were incubated for 1 hwith anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) (Bio-Rad,Sydney, Australia) diluted 1 : 1000 in Ab SM. Membraneswere washed as previously described above. Bands werevisualized by incubating the membranes in 30% w \u2044 v H2O2in Tris-saline and a 4-chloro-1-napthol tablet according tothe manufacturer\u2019s directions (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney,Australia) solubilised in 100% methanol combinedTable 1 Tenacibaculum maritimum isolates used in this studyAccession no.

The reaction wasstopped by the addition of water.HydrophobicityThe hydrophobicity assay was modified from the methoddescribed by Rosenberg et al. (1980). Twenty-four hourMSB cultures of T. maritimum were centrifuged for30 min at 2000 g. Cell pellets were resuspended andwashed twice in PBS (pH 7\u00c62) and diluted to an initialOD (ODI) of 0\u00c66 with a spectrophotometer (k = 600 nm).In a glass test tube, 1\u00c62 ml of each bacterial suspensionwas added along with 0\u00c62 ml of the hydrocarbons n-hex-adecane (Merck Chemicals, Melbourne, Australia), n-octane (Sigma-Aldrich) or p-xylene (Merck Chemicals).Each bacterial suspension-hydrocarbon test was preparedand assayed in triplicate. The suspension was agitated vig-orously for 2 min, and then allowed to separate for20 min into the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases.From each tube, 1 ml of the aqueous phase was trans-ferred to a cuvette and the final OD (ODF) of each sus-pension measured (k = 600 nm). The hydrophobicity ofeach bacterial suspension to each hydrocarbon wasexpressed as the percentage partitioning into the hydro-carbon phase:Partitioning into hydrocarbon\u00f0%\u00de \u00bc\u00bd\u00f0ODI \ufffdODF\u00de=ODI\ufffd \ufffd 100For each hydrocarbon of each isolate the percentage parti-tioning was ranked. Each rank was added together andthen divided by three (i.e. three hydrocarbons). This gavea final rank that could be sorted in order of greatest tolowest overall hydrophobicity.ResultsOut of the eighteen local isolates, 16 produced the samewhole cell protein profile as the type strain NCIMB 2154Tand reference strain Baxa lyl-1 (Fig. 2). These isolatesshowed banding patterns from 118\u00c64 kDa down to9\u00c62 kDa. Major single bands are located around 12, 15\u00c65,25, 45\u00c66, and 99\u00c65 kDa with a triplet at 20 kDa. The twolocal isolates that varied (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) showedsimilarities to the other isolates, however there was adistinct band at 17\u00c66 kDa for 89/4747 and bands at 135,22 and 12\u00c67 kDa for 01/0356-7 which indicate they aredifferent from each other (Fig. 2).Eight different ECP groupings were detected from all20 isolates (Table 2). Bands that all isolates have incommon occurred at 46\u00c65 and 73 kDa. Isolates 01/0356-7 and 89/4747 showed the greatest variation, making upindividual groups. Strains used for comparison, NCIMB2154T and Baxa lyl-1, showed identical profiles to eachother, which was again different from the local isolates2003121697GB ED F HC IA46\u00b7573Figure 2 SDS-PAGE of extracellular product profiles of Tenacibacu-lum maritimum isolates stained with Coomassie Blue R.

There was no correlation of isolates between yeargroups or geographical locations within Tasmania.LPS profiles indicated that there are at least two sero-types amongst the isolates as 89/4747 and 01/0356-7 didnot show any banding using the Western blottingtechnique (Fig. 4). However, in this study, it was notdetermined if these isolates (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) hada shared serotype. Laddering appeared uniform acrossmost other isolates; the major exceptions were 89/0329-5, Baxa lyl-1, 89/4762 and 91/0126 which had a distinctband at 55 kDa and isolates 00/1793, 00/0400-3 and 98/3186 showed a different LPS profile. Based on differ-ences in the profiles, isolates were grouped together(Table 3).All isolates of T. maritimum were hydrophobic(Fig. 5). In all cases, isolates showed the lowest hydro-phobicity towards n-hexadecane and the highest top-xylene, with moderate hydrophobicity to n-octane.Two exceptions were isolates 89/4762 and Baxa lyl-1 thatpossessed strong hydrophobic tendencies with all threehydrocarbons. Overall, all isolates were hydrophobic andas surface area of the alkane molecule decreased, hydro-phobicity increased. After final rankings, isolate 89/4762was found to be the most hydrophobic. Isolates 89/4747and 01/0356-7 were IFAT negative; all other 18 isolateswere IFAT positive, including Baxa lyl-1 and NCIMB2154T.DiscussionThe aims of this study was to determine if all local strainswere homologous in respect of an arbitrary referenceTable 2 Extracellular product profiles groupings of Tenacibaculummaritimum isolates based on SDS-PAGE analysisGroups Isolates accession numbers1 89/1579-2G, 89/0329-5, 89/4762, 96/0457-42 89/4913-6, 90/1445, 90/1123, 91/0126, 91/02473 89/47474 89/0329-1, 00/08135 00/0422-3, 00/32806 01/0356-77 00/0400-3, 00/1793-18 Baxa lyl-1, NCIMB 2154T1119353.536.129.521.3A B C D E F GFigure 3 SDS-PAGE of silver stained lipopolysaccharide profiles of Te-nacibaculum maritimum isolates.

Establishing homo-geneity is important so that strain variation can be assessedand taken into account for subsequent pathogenicity trialsand for nominating a representative strain that can beused for a prototype vaccine in Atlantic salmon.Based on the cell envelope, including whole cellanalysis, T. maritimum has been described by otherauthors as a homogeneous species (Bernardet et al. 1994;Avendan\u0303o-Herrera et al. 2004). Initial observations ofthe local T. maritimum isolates using whole cell proteinprofiles indicate a relatively homogeneous group. Thesefindings are similar to that of Pazos (1997), who reportedT. maritimum isolates with a large level of similaritybetween isolates for proteins with molecular mass in therange of 14\u00c64\u201397\u00c64 kDa. While minor banding is evidentabove 100 kDa with the Tasmanian isolates, major bandscould be seen from 12 to 99\u00c65 kDa. For the purpose ofthis study, assessment of the protein profiles was intendedto be qualitative only, and although the gel loadingvolume was constant (10 ll), protein concentration ofpreparations was not standardised. No weight can beapplied to relative differences in band intensity betweenthe different isolates. With the exception of two isolates(89/4747 and 01/0356-7), all other local isolates showedthe same profile to that of the type strain NCIMB 2154T.Similarly, by IFAT, all isolates were positive using thepolyclonal antibody to isolate 89/0329-5 except for iso-lates 89/4747 and 01/0356-7 suggesting these two isolatesrepresent some other distinct serogroup or groups.LPS analysis revealed further antigenic heterogeneitywithin the group of isolates, with three distinct patternsevident compared to the reference strain NCIMB 2154T.Initial attempts at silver staining LPS were successful onlywith the positive control E. coli ATCC 25922. While thismethod produced clear laddering for E. coli isolates, itproved unsatisfactory for T. maritimum as the bandingappeared to be masked possibly by protein (Fig. 1).Although cell preparations had been digested with pro-teinase K, it is known that some proteins are resistant todigestion with proteinase K (S\u00f8rensen et al. 1992) whichmight account for the failure to disclose the LPS moietiesusing the method of Hitchcock and Brown (1983). Theunderlying LPS profiles however could clearly be shownby Western blotting using polyclonal antiserum to 89/0329-5.Although initially described as antigenically homoge-neous (Wakabayashi et al. 1986), T. maritimum is has beenreported to be antigenically heterogeneous (Ostland et al.1999; Avendan\u0303o-Herrera et al. 2004). Antigenic differenceshave been demonstrated among T. maritimum isolatesfrom Atlantic salmon using immunoblot analysis of LPS(Ostland et al. 1999) where differences were detectedamong isolates and between the isolates and referencestrains (NCIMB 2153, 2154T). These differences have beenattributed to the O-antigen side chains, which may beassociated with different strains from outbreaks on bothtemporal and geographical aspects (Ostland et al. 1999).The current study reported here supports evidence of anti-genic variation, though it appears that most of the strainsform a homogeneous group with little LPS variation,despite isolates being collected over a 12 year period fromtwo different hosts: Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout.While most of the isolates seemed to be homogeneousantigenically, as assessed by IFAT, strains 89/4747 and01/0356-7 appeared different. The identity of both strainshad been confirmed previously by PCR using 16S rRNAgene primers for T. maritimum (Carson and Wilson2003) and had a phenotype consistent with T. maritimum(Schmidtke et al. 1991), yet there were differences inthe whole cell and LPS profiles as well as serotypingby IFAT. We concluded that these two isolates mayrepresent a different serotype or serotypes but requiresfurther analysis.Partitioning into hydrocarbon (%)0 20 40 60 80 100Isolates (in order of rank)98/318600/1793-190/144501/0356-791/012689/0329-589/4747NCIMB 2154T00/081300/0400-300/328089/1579-2G90/112389/4913-689/0329-191/024796/0457-400/0422-3Baxa lyl-189/4762Figure 5 Graph showing the partitioning of each Tenacibaculummaritimum isolate into the three hydrocarbons (\u00b1SE).

(2004)reported distinct serotypes for T. maritimum in turbot(Scophthalmus maximus), sole (S. solea) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). They also found different sero-types according to the source of the isolation. Forexample, strains isolated from turbot reacted only withthe antiserum derived from turbot isolates. Similar find-ings were noted for sole and gilthead sea bream strainswith the antiserum obtained against the sole isolate(Avendan\u0303o-Herrera et al. 2004). The relationship betweenserotype and host evident from this study was not foundwith the salmonid strains. The antiserum to 89/0329-5isolated from Atlantic salmon reacted with isolate 00/3280from rainbow trout, the Baxa lyl-1 strain from Japaneseflounder and NCIMB 2154T from red sea bream.The primary purpose of evaluating serotype in thisstudy was to establish the extent of serological diversitythat might exist among isolates from Atlantic salmon forthe purpose of selecting a strain that might serve fordeveloping a vaccine for use in Tasmania. Establishingthe serological relationship to strains of T. maritimumfrom other hosts and determining their serotype oncesuch a schema is developed will provide context to sero-type observations which have been generated thus far.ECPs are compounds secreted by bacteria and thoughtto facilitate invasion of the host (Dalsgaard 1993).Although toxic activities of T. maritimum have beeninvestigated previously (Baxa et al. 1988b), this is the firstaccount of ECP protein profiles for T. maritimum. TheECP findings suggest significant heterogeneity within thespecies.Heterogeneity of ECPs is present in other marinepathogenic bacterial species including Aeromonas salmoni-cida (Gudmundsdo\u0301ttir 1996). Out of 32 strains analysed,six different protease groups were detected. All typicalstrains belonged to a single group, while atypical strainsshowed significant differences from the typical strains andbetween each other. It was suggested that ECP type wasmore strongly associated with geographic location than thehost fish species. Our results indicate that host may not bean important factor since isolate 00/3280 from rainbowtrout grouped with 00 \u2044 0422-3 from Atlantic salmon. Bothisolates however are from salmonids which may accountfor the similarity in ECP profile. The type strain NCIMB2154Tand Baxa lyl-1 are also from different host species,yet are grouped together having identical protein profiles.Attachment of bacterial pathogens to different sub-strates is considered an important step in colonisation ofhost cells as this has the potential to initiate disease(Vatsos et al. 2001). A number of techniques areemployed to assess non-specific and specific attachmentto different substrates e.g., salt aggregation test (SAT),phase partitioning with hydrocarbon solvents, and adher-ence to nitrocellulose filters (NCF). While more than oneassay system is normally used to obtain a robust measure-ment of hydrophobicity (Santos et al. 1990), a single assaywas used here because the focus of this study was toassess similarities and differences between a range of iso-lates. Also, implementing other assays was found to beproblematic because of the profound auto-agglutinationof T. maritimum. Of the methods available, phase parti-tioning with hydrocarbons was found to be more accom-modating than other techniques for assessing surfacehydrophobicity of T. maritimum. As expected, all isolateswere hydrophobic, consistent with other T. maritimumhydrophobicity studies (Sorongon et al. 1991; Magarin\u0303oset al. 1996; Kawahara and Kusuda 1998).Using the phenotypic markers described, the isolateswere grouped and ranked in order to make selections forlater pathogenicity and vaccination trials (van Gelderenet al. 2009, in press). The three isolates chosen for the path-ogenicity trials were: 89/4747, 89/4762, 00/3280. Isolate 89/4747 was chosen due to its differences with other isolatesfor the characterisation tests and in particular because itmay represent a distinct serotype. Isolates 00/3280 and 89/4762 showed similarities to each other and most other iso-lates in whole cell protein profile and serotype. However, inthe ECP groupings, 89/4762 occurred within a commongroup, whereas 00/3280 was grouped with only one otherisolate with a distinct electropherotype. This contrasts withthe LPS groupings, where 00/3280 was similar to mostother isolates while conversely 89/4762 was different andplaced into a minor group. Isolate 89/4762 was also themost hydrophobic of all the isolates and was included todetermine if this characteristic was a marker of virulence.The data collected from this study enabled theresearchers to make educated decisions about the choiceof isolate tested based on similarities and differencesbetween them. It provided more information and soundreasoning for choices, rather than random selections.Isolate 89/4762 was used in the final vaccination study(van Gelderen et al. 2009).ReferencesAlsina, M. and Blanch, A.R.
