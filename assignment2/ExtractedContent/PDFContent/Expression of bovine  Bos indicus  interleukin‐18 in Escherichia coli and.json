In the present study, we amplified and cloned the sequence (582 bp) encoding full-length bovineIL-18 from PBMC stimulated with PHA. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence of Bosindicus IL-18 showed an identity of 86\u201398% compared with IL-18 sequences of other ruminants. Theinsert was subcloned into a pET 32a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and thematured protein was obtained by caspase I treatment. The specificity of these proteins was confirmedby western blotting. The biological activity of the purified protein was analyzed by its ability to induceIFN-\u03b3 production in PBMC measured by ELISA and qPCR.Key words biological activity, Bos indicus, expression, interleukin (IL-18).IL-18, an enhancer of IL-12-driven Th1 immune responsein hosts, is important in developing immunity against in-tracellular pathogens. IL-18 was originally termed IFN-\u03b3-inducing factor because of its ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 pro-duction by Th1 cells and NK. Besides its IFN-\u03b3-inducingactivity, IL-18 has been found to have other biologicalfunctions, such as stimulation of Th1 cell development,upregulation of GM-CSF and IL-2R\u03b1, decreased IL-10 ex-pression in T cells and the modulation of immunoglobulinsecretion by B cells (1\u20135). The pro-inflammatory activityof IL-18 is mediated by the production of nitric oxide,prostaglandins (6, 7) and inflammatory cytokines, such asTNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. IL-18 induces chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1, MCP-1) and recruits monocytes and macrophages tothe site of infection (2, 8). IL-18 is secreted as a precursormolecule of 24 kDa which gets cleaved into an 18-kDamature molecule which is mediated by caspase I (6).

In the present communication, we reportthe cloning and expression of the full-length bovine (Bosindicus) IL-18 cDNA in the prokaryotic system and itsbiological activity in vitro.PBMC (5 \u00d7 106 cells) isolated from cattle (Indianlocal Hallikar breed, Bos indicus) by density gradientcentrifugation using Histopaque 1.077 (Sigma India,Bangalore, India) grown in RPMI-1640 medium werestimulated with PHA (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 16 hr. Total RNAwas extracted from stimulated cells using TRIZOL reagent(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription wascarried out using an oligo dT primer. cDNA was usedto amplify the bovine IL-18 sequence using IL-18L (5\u2032GGCGGAATTCATGGCTGCAGAACAAGT AGA 3\u2032) andreverse IL-18-R (5\u2032 GGCGGCG GCCGCCTAGTTCTG-GTTTTGAACAGT 3\u2032) primers designed using the IL-18sequence of Bos taurus (Accession No. EU276078). The564 c\u00a9 2010 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty LtdExpression of bovine IL-18 in E. coliNOTEpurified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotIand ligated to EcoRI- and NotI-digested pBSSK+ vector.The cloned insert was subjected for sequencing in an auto-mated DNA sequencer and the sequence data submitted toGen Bank (Accession No. FJ985771). The nucleotide andthe deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene wasaligned with the sequences of different species of domes-tic animals and humans (available in the public database)using the Meg Align (DNASTAR version 1.82) programand phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGAversion 2.1 (13).The IL-18 sequence was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-tor (Novagen USA) at EcoRI and NotI sites (pET-bo-IL18).The pET-IL18 plasmid was transformed into E. coli strainBL-21(DE3) PLys for protein expression. Cells were grown37\u25e6C to OD600 = 0.8 and the expression was induced with1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for4 hr at 30\u25e6C. Bacterial lysate was used for SDS-PAGE anal-ysis under denaturing conditions to visualize the proteinband. Histidine-tagged fusion protein was purified on anickel-chelating agarose affinity column according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions under denaturing conditions(Invitrogen). Purified IL-18 was renatured by dialysis andthe endotoxin was removed by treating with Triton X 114using a two-phase extraction method (14) and the endo-toxin quantity was measured by Limulus amebocyte lysateassay kit (LAL; Biocompare, Kidlington, UK). The puri-fied proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and westernblotting using anti-human mAb (2 \u03bcg/ml; R&D Systems,Minneapolis, MN). The purified protein was treated with1 U/20 ng protein human recombinant caspase I (Biovi-sion, Mountain View, CA). The digested protein was usedfor measurement of biological activity.The induction of IFN-\u03b3 from PBMC by IL-18 proteinwas used as an assay for IL-18 biological activity. Ini-tially, the dose of IL-18 required for optimal stimulationof PBMC was determined by using various doses (50\u2013400 ng) and the 200 ng dose was found to be optimal.PBMC isolated from cattle were stimulated with recombi-nant IL-18 protein (200 ng/ml) and IFN-\u03b3 gene expressionin PBMC was then measured by real-time PCR. Total RNAextracted from PBMC using TRIZOL was used to synthe-size cDNA using an oligo dT primer. PCR reaction mixturecontained 1\u00d7 SYBR green reaction mix (Applied Biosys-tems Carlsbad, CA) and 300 nm of both IFN-\u03b3-specificprimers IFN-L (5\u2032 tggatatcatcaagcaagacatgtt 3\u2032) and IFN-R (5\u2032 aggtcattcatcactttgatgagttcat 3\u2032). Real-time PCR wascarried out using the ABI prism 7300 (Applied Biosys-tems) with conditions consisting of an initial step at 50\u25e6Cfor 2 min and 95\u25e6C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95\u25e6Cfor 15 s and at 60\u25e6C for 1 min. The transcribed RNA fromthe plasmid pcDNA-IFN-\u03b3 (containing full sequence ofbovine IFN-\u03b3) was used in the standard curve. The IFN-\u03b3-RNA copy number was calculated from the quantifiedRNA (optic density at 260 nm) and serial dilutions of RNA(with 1 \u00d7 102 to 1 \u00d7 107 copies of RNA) were used forstandard curve preparation.Production of IFN-\u03b3 by bovine whole blood stimu-lated with bovine recombinant IL-18 was carried out us-ing a bovine IFN-\u03b3 ELISA kit (Mabtech, Nacka Strand,Sweden) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions(15). Heparinized whole blood was incubated with200 ng/ml purified IL18 in a six-well plate for 24 hr at 37\u25e6Cin a CO2 incubator. The plate was centrifuged at 800 \u00d7gfor 10 min at 4\u25e6C. Supernatant (100 \u03bcl) was pipetted outfrom each well into a new 96-well plate. IFN-\u03b3 standardknown amounts in duplicate were included and the quan-tity of IFN-\u03b3 in the unknown samples was estimated fromthe standard curve obtained from the known standards.Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.Bovine IL-18 has an open reading frame of 582 bpencoding a protein of 193 amino acids with a predictedmolecular weight of 24 kDa. The sequence alignmentshowed that bovine precursor IL-18 also has a signal pep-tide of 35 amino acids at the N-terminal followed by a ma-ture peptide of 157 amino acids. Bovine IL-18 has high se-quence homology with that of other ruminants, as it shares94% and 92% amino acid identity with IL-18 of bubalineand nilgai, respectively (AC NO-AY401033, AY842499). Itwas shown to have 91%, 90%, 85% and 82% amino acididentity with carpine, ovine, porcine and equine IL-18 se-quences, respectively (AY605263, AJ401033, U68701.1).However, it shares approximately 76\u201378% amino acididentity with human, fox, feline, and canine proteins(BC007461, EF581884, AB056857, Y11133). Phylogeneticanalysis of the nucleotide sequences of IL-18 of differentspecies of domestic animals is presented as an unrootedtree (Fig. 1). As is evident from the tree, IL-18 sequencesof ovine, nilgai and buffalo are clustered together and aredistinct from other species, including humans. Sequencecomparison of IL-18 of Bos indicus with that of otherspecies showed that Glu42 and Lys89 are conserved inall the species in which sequences were compared. Theseconserved amino acids are shown to be critical to bindingFig. 1.

Siva Reddy et al.not only the IL-18 receptor molecule, but also the IL-18binding protein, a naturally occurring protein which bindsand neutralizes the biological activity of IL-18. Deletionmutants of IL-18 at Glu42 and Lys89 have lost their bi-ological activity (16). Structure analysis of human IL-18has revealed that three sites are important for receptorbinding. From the aligned sequences, it was observed thatthe residues forming these critical sites were nearly wellconserved in all the domestic animals. They include R49,D53, M69, D71 and D168, which form site I; K40, L41,K44, R94 and R140, which form site II; and 115K, 120Kand D134, which form site III.Bovine IL-18 insert was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-tor, transformed into BL-21 (DE3) PLys cells and theexpression of the gene was induced by IPTG. An addi-tional band of 42 kDa was observed in cases where lysatefrom induced bacteria corresponded to the IL-18 fusionprotein. Histidine-tagged protein was purified from thelysates by a nickel column. Precursor IL-18 undergoesproteolytic cleavage by IL-1\u03b2 converting enzyme to gener-ate a mature bioactive 18 kDa molecule. We expressed theIL-18 in soluble form and purified the protein by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Purified IL-18 wasrenatured by dialysis and the endotoxin was removed bytreating with Triton-X114 and the endotoxin content inthe purified product was found to be 0.09 EU/\u03bcg pro-tein (endotoxin unit). The fusion protein of 42 kDa wasexpressed initially and the 18 kDa matured protein wasobtained after caspase I. Fusion protein from the crudelysate, purified protein and the mature protein reactedwith IL-18 anti-human monoclonal antibodies in an im-munoblot assay (Fig. 2a,b). As IL-18 is a potent inducerof IFN-\u03b3, we studied the level of IFN-\u03b3-specific mRNAFig. 2. (a) Immunoblotting of recombinant bovine precursor IL-18.

Quanti-tation of IFN-\u03b3 showed a 36-fold increase in copy numberin IL-18-treated cells compared to the basal level (Fig. 3a).Quantification of IFN-\u03b3 secreted by the stimulated cells(whole blood) was carried out by ELISA and showed a35-fold increase compared to the basal level (Fig. 3b).Quantities of IFN-\u03b3 were 120 pg/ml and 2400 pg/ml inthe unstimulated and IL-18-stimulated cells, respectively.Stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 by IL-18 measured by qPCR is moreor less similar to values observed in ELISA.These studies have shown that IL-18 expressed in E. coliis biologically active. Recently, several researchers haveused IL-18 as an effective vaccine adjuvant not only inmice, but also in non-human primates (4, 17). Biologicallyactive bovine recombinant IL-18 protein expressed in theprokaryotic system will be useful in investigating the roleof this cytokine as a therapeutic agent or a vaccine adjuvantin bovines.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors acknowledge the financial assistance of theDepartment of Biotechnology Government of India, andthe Director, IVRI Izatnagar, Joint Director Indian Veteri-nary Research Institute, Bangalore for providing facilities.The author further acknowledges Dr P.
