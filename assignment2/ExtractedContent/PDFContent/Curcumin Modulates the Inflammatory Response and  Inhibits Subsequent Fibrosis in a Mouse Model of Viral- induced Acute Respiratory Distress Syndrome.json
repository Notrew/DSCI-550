London,Lucille London*Department of Oral Biology and Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States of AmericaAbstractAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage usuallysecondary to an intense host inflammatory response of the lung to a pulmonary or extrapulmonary infectious or non-infectious insult often leading to the development of intra-alveolar and interstitial fibrosis. Curcumin, the principalcurcumoid of the popular Indian spice turmeric, has been demonstrated as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in abroad spectrum of diseases. Using our well-established model of reovirus 1/L-induced acute viral pneumonia, whichdisplays many of the characteristics of the human ALI/ARDS, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects ofcurcumin. Female CBA/J mice were treated with curcumin (50 mg/kg) 5 days prior to intranasal inoculation with 107PFUreovirus 1/L and daily, thereafter. Mice were evaluated for key features associated with ALI/ARDS. Administration ofcurcumin significantly modulated inflammation and fibrosis, as revealed by histological and biochemical analysis. Theexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1, key chemokines/cytokines implicated in the development of ALI/ARDS, from boththe inflammatory infiltrate and whole lung tissue were modulated by curcumin potentially through a reduction in thephosphorylated form of NFkB p65. While the expression of TGF\u00df1 was not modulated by curcumin, TGF\u00df Receptor II, whichis required for TGF\u00df signaling, was significantly reduced. In addition, curcumin also significantly inhibited the expression ofa-smooth muscle actin and Tenascin-C, key markers of myofibroblast activation. This data strongly supports a role forcurcumin in modulating the pathogenesis of viral-induced ALI/ARDS in a pre-clinical model potentially manifested throughthe alteration of inflammation and myofibroblast differentiation.Citation: Avasarala S, Zhang F, Liu G, Wang R, London SD, et al.

Pulmonaryfibrosis, itself, is a devastating disease with an almost universallyterminal outcome affecting five million people worldwide,including some 200,000 cases culminating in 40,000 deaths/yearin the US [3]. Factors that predispose to ARDS are diverse andinclude sepsis, aspiration, and pneumonias [1,2]. Althoughsupportive therapy has improved survival somewhat, there areno effective therapeutic agents for improving clinical outcomes inARDS patients [1,2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for thedevelopment of treatments to halt the progression of thisdevastating syndrome.There are limited models to study ALI/ARDS and no goodmodel systems currently available to study ALI/ARDS and/orpulmonary fibrosis initiated by an infectious (viral) insult [4].Pulmonary infection of CBA/J mice with 107PFU reovirusserotype 1, strain Lang (reovirus 1/L) induces ALI/ARDS,providing a model that recapitulates both its acute exudativephase, including the formation of hyaline membranes, as well as itsregenerative phase with healing by repair, leading to intra-alveolarand interstitial fibrosis [5,6]. As with ARDS in human patients,corticosteroids were ineffective in attenuating the infiltration ofinflammatory leukocytes, suppressing key cytokine/chemokineexpression, and inhibiting the development of fibrotic lesions inreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS [7,8]. Finally, aberrant apoptosis hasbeen proposed as one mechanism leading to fibrotic lesiondevelopment in ALI/ARDS, and we have demonstrated anindirect role for the Fas/FasL pathway in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS [9]. Therefore, our model provides a very clinicallyrelevant model for infection-induced acute viral pneumonialeading to ALI/ARDS.PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285Curcumin, a natural phytochemical present in turmeric, theground powder of the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, has beendescribed as having anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties and has been used to treat cancer,arthritis, digestive and liver abnormalities, and respiratoryinfections [10\u201316]. Toxicity studies conducted on animals haveindicated no adverse effects with prolonged use [14,17\u201319]. Whilecurcumin\u2019s effects have been studied in many diseases, the fullpotential benefits of curcumin and its mechanisms of action havejust begun to be elucidated for the treatment of pulmonarydiseases including fibrosis and ALI/ARDS [20\u201328]. Pretreatmentwith curcumin showed beneficial effects on ALI induced by oleicacid [29], by paraquat toxicity [26], by sepsis-induced ALI [30\u201334] and by aspiration-induced ALI [35]. Although the precisemechanism by which curcumin mediated it\u2019s beneficial effects inthese model systems is not clear, it has been suggested that themodulation of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatoryfactors may be involved in curcumin\u2019s effects [14,17\u201319]. In thisstudy, curcumin treatment in vivo effected both inflammatory(diffuse alveolar damage, DAD) and fibrotic lesion developmentleading to a significant reduction in the development of ALI/ARDS in reovirus 1/L-infected mice in this pre-clinical model,which may be manifested, at least in part, through the modulationof cytokine/chemokine expression through NFkB and throughmodulation of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis throughthe regulation of TGF\u00df receptor II (RII).Materials and MethodsAnimalsFour to five week-old female CBA/J mice were obtained fromJackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained inmicro-isolator cages under specific pathogen free conditions in aBL-2 facility. Cages were housed in a HEPA-filtered animalisolator clean room (Nuaire Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA) and allanimal manipulations were performed in class II biological safetycabinets. Virally primed mice were kept physically isolated from allother experimental and stock mice.Ethics StatementThis study was carried out in strict accordance with therecommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Theprotocol was approved by the Stony Brook University InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Protocol # 235392-5).VirusReovirus 1/L was originally obtained from Dr. W. Joklik (DukeUniversity School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA). Third-passage gradient-purified stocks were obtained by re-cloning andamplifying parental stocks on L-929 fibroblast cells (AmericanType Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) [5,6]. Followingthe purification of new stocks, infectious viral titers were obtainedby limiting dilution on L-929 monolayers [5,6].Inoculation ProtocolAnimals were lightly anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 100 mlof 18% Ketamine (Vetalar 100 mg/ml; Fort Dodge Laboratories,Inc., Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and 10% Xylazine (Xylazine HCl20 mg/ml; Phoenix Scientific, Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA) insterile injectable grade 0.9% NaCl (Baxter Healthcare Corp.,Deerfield, IL, USA) prior to immunization. Animals wereinoculated by the intranasal (i.n.) application of 107PFU of reovirus1/L in 30 ml (15 ml in each nostril) in 0.9% NaCl. Control animalswere inoculated with 30 ml (15 ml in each nostril) 0.9% NaCl. Micewere treated with curcumin ($94% curcuminoid content) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration of 50 mg/kg in2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in a total volume of 100 mldelivered by an i.p. injection 5 days prior to infection and daily,thereafter. A curcumin dosage of 50 mg/kg was chosen after aseries of initial experiments analyzing histologically the inflamma-tory infiltrate and fibrotic lesions using curcumin concentrationsranging from 50 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg (data not shown). Ascontrols, either saline or reovirus 1/L-infected mice received adaily i.p. injection of 2% CMC (vehicle). Saline mice treated with2% CMC (vehicle) did not develop any significant pathology (notshown). Likewises, reovirus 1/L-infected mice treated with 2%CMC (vehicle) did not show any significant improvement in lungpathology (not shown). Since our initial finding indicated thatvehicle treatment alone does not modulate key features of reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS (inflammation and fibrosis), we compareduntreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS to curcumin-treated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS to minimize stressing the animals unnecessarily.After the indicated time points, animals were sacrificed via carbondioxide inhalation (EuthanexTMCO2 system).Titration of infectious virionsFreshly harvested lungs (without the associated lymph nodes)were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until use.Frozen lungs were freeze-thawed three times in 1 ml MEMcontaining 10% FBS followed by homogenization for 1.5 minuteswith a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Lungsupernatants were then subjected to centrifugation at 2000 g for10 minutes at 4uC. Serial dilutions of tissue homogenates (100 ml)in gel-saline were used in a standard plaque assay to determinereovirus 1/L PFU/ml on L-929 cell monolayers as previouslydescribed [36].HistologyLungs were inflated in situ with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) by intra-tracheal intubation, removed, and suspended inan additional 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours at 4uC beforebeing embedded in paraffin. Histological staining was performedon 4-micron sections by McClain Laboratories (Smithtown, NY,USA). Mason\u2019s Trichrome and Sirius red staining were used tovisualize collagen deposition. With Mason\u2019s Trichrome, the nucleistain a dark red/purple, muscle stains red, and connective tissueincluding collagen stains blue. With Sirius red, in bright-fieldmicroscopy, collagen is red on a yellowish background. Nuclei, ifstained, are black but may often be grey or brown. To score lunginflammation and fibrosis, lung samples were screened for thefollowing three histopathological parameters: (a) deposition ofextracellular matrix; (b) leukocyte infiltration (interstitial inflam-mation); and (c) airway obliteration due to granulation tissueformation and/or fibrosis. Each slide was blindly evaluated usinglow (4X and 10X) and high (20X and 40X) magnification andscored on a scale of 0\u20133 with 0 as absent (normal); 1 as mild; 2 asmoderate; and 3 as severe [5,6]. The final histology score wasbased on evaluation of whole lung sections (one section per mouse)and values reported are an average of 18 (reovirus 1/L\u2013ALI/ARDS d9 and d14), 12 (curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS d9) and 28 (reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS d14) individualassessments. Images from low (20X) and high (40X) magnificationon an Olympus BX40 microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY, USA)were captured with a Polaroid digital microscope camera andedited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software.Curcumin Inhibits Reovirus 1/L-ARDS DevelopmentPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285Sircol Assay for Collagen ContentSoluble lung collagen was measured in lung homogenates usingthe Sircol Assay (Biocolor Ltd, UK), following manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. Briefly, the right lobe of the lung was suspended at30 mg/tissue/ml in 0.5 M acetic acid and homogenized for 3 minwith a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK,USA). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation and 100 mlof the supernatant was mixed with the Sircol dye and centrifuged.The pellets were dissolved with alkaline reagent, as directed.Absorbance was read at 540 nm. Total soluble collagen wasdetermined using a standard curve. The Sircol Assay is suitable formonitoring collagen produced in situ where collagen that is solublein cold acid/pepsin can be recovered and measured frommammalian soft tissues, cartilages and fluids.Flow Cytometric AnalysisLungs were harvested and digested with 5 ml 1 mg/mlcollagenase H (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) at 37uC for single cellisolation. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 5%FCS and 0.05% azide, and resuspended at 106cells/ml. Cells werestained for surface markers as described previously [5,6]. Thefollowing antibodies (Abs) were purchased from BD Biosciences(San Jose, CA, USA) and used in this analysis: CD4 (GK1.5,L3T4; R-PE-labeled); CD8a (53\u20136.7, PerCP-labeled); CD11b/Mac-1 (M1/70, integrinam chain, Mac-1 a chain, APC-labeled);CD19 (1D3, FITC-labeled); Ly6G (RB6-8C5, Gr-1, PerCP-Cy5.5-labeled); and R-PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse Pan-NKcells (DX5). Isotype matched controls were run for each sample(not shown). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a dual-laser Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Accuri, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)and data was analyzed using FlowJo Analysis Software (Tree StarInc., Ashland, OR, USA).Immunofluorescence (IF)Immunostaining of paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin em-bedded lung sections was performed by IF procedures. Five toeight-micron sequential sections were collected on poly-L-lysinetreated slides (Sigma-Aldrich), deparaffinized in xylene anddehydrated in graded alcohol. Tissue sections were then heattreated for 10 minutes with a Target Retrieval Solution (DakoCorp. S1700; Carpinteria, CA, USA) following manufacture\u2019sinstructions. Tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 minutes at room temperature, followed byincubation in 10% BSA for 1 hr. The sections were thenincubated overnight at 4uC with a rat anti-tenascin-C (TN-C)Ab (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich), a mouse anti-a-smooth muscle actin(a-SMA) Ab (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), or a goat anti-E-cadherin Ab(1:200, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After threewashes in PBS, slides were incubated with the correspondingsecondary Abs conjugated with photostable Alexa FluorH dye(1:1000, Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA)for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were treated with Vectashieldanti-fade mounting medium with DAPI to stain nuclei (VectorLaboratories) and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-Smicroscopy system. For control incubations, primary Abs wasreplaced by normal mouse, goat, or rat serum (Vector Labora-tories).Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanineaminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)activitiesSerum was collected by cardiac puncture at the time ofeuthanasia and was stored at 280uC until use. Serum AST, ALTand AP activities were measured enzymatically using standardizedenzyme assays kits obtained from Stanbio Laboratory (Boerne,TX, USA).RNA Preparation and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Lung tissue was homogenized in the presence of TRI ReagentHSolution and total RNA was isolated according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was carried out in 20 ml totalvolume containing 100 ng of RNA and 200 nM of each primerusing a Power SYBRH Green RNA-to-CTTM1-Step Kit (AppliedBiosystems). After reverse transcription for 30 min at 48uC and astarting denaturation for 10 minutes at 95uC, 40 PCR cycles (15 s95uC and 1 min 60uC) were performed using the ABI StepOnePlusTMReal-Time PCR SystemH (Applied Biosystems). Oligonu-cleotide primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1. Eachsample was evaluated in triplicate. Specificity of PCR products wasevaluated at the end of each run by melt curve analysis. A non-template control and an endogenous control (GAPDH) were usedfor relative quantification. All quantitations (threshold cycle [CT]values) were normalized to that of GAPDH to generate DCT, andthe difference between the DCT value of the sample and that ofthe reference (saline (control)) was calculated as DDCT. Therelative level of gene expression was expressed as 22DDCT[R].Western Blot AnalysisFor western blotting, lungs were removed and homogenized in1.5 ml Tissue PE LBTMtissue protein extraction lysis buffercontaining a cocktail of protease inhibitors (N-Ethylmaleimide[10 mM], benzamidine [5 mM], leupeptin [50 mg/ml], pepstatinA [5 mg/ml], PMSF [2 mM]) using a Mini-Beadbeater (GenoTechnology, St. Louis, MO, USA). Total protein was determinedusing a modified Bradford protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Twentymicrograms of total protein were mixed with 4X sample buffercontaining 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE(Ready Gels Tris HCl 10%; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), andtransferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were then blockedfor 2 hours in 5% non-fat milk in TBST, and incubated overnightat 4uC with either a rat anti-TN-C (Sigma-Aldrich), a mousemonoclonal anti-a-SMA (Sigma-Aldrich), a polyclonal goat anti-E-cadherin (R&D Systems), a rabbit anti-phosph-p65-NFkB, arabbit anti-phosph-p38 or a rabbit anti-\u00df actin (Cell SignalingTechnology, Danvers, MA, USA) Ab. The membranes were thenwashed 3X and incubated with the appropriate secondary Absconjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Thermo-Scientific) for oneand a half hours at room temperature. Western analysis using ananti-\u00df actin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was performed todemonstrate equal loading. Immunostained bands were visualizedwith SuperSignalH West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit(Thermo-Scientific) followed by exposure to HyBlot CLTMAutoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc, Metuchen, NJ,USA). Band intensities on scanned gels were analyzed using thepublic domain National Institutes of Health ImageJ program.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed by using an ANOVA withtreatment and time of study included as factors. When appropri-ate, comparisons between two variables were performed using aStudent\u2019s t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.Curcumin Inhibits Reovirus 1/L-ARDS DevelopmentPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285ResultsAdministration of Curcumin protects CBA/J mice fromthe Development of ALI/ARDS in Response to reovirus 1/LIn order to determine the efficacy of treatment with curcuminon the development of either ARDS associated DAD or fibrosis,CBA/J mice were inoculated i.n. with 107PFU reovirus 1/L andwere either untreated or treated with 50 mg/kg curcumin by i.p.injection 5 days prior to infection and daily, thereafter. We firstevaluated whether daily curcumin treatment of mice in vivoaffected the ability of reovirus 1/L to infect or replicate in reovirus1/L-inoculated mice (Fig. 1). We demonstrate on day 9 post-reovirus 1/L-inoculation that both the number of reovirus 1/Linfectious virions (Fig. 1A) as well as the ability of reovirus 1/L toreplicate in vivo (Fig. 1B) are not affected by curcumin treatment.Thus, we demonstrate that the mechanism of action of curcuminin this model is not due to affects on replication or clearance ofreovirus 1/L from infected lungs. To determine the extent ofinflammation and fibrosis, paraffin-embedded lung sections werestained with H&E, Sirius Red, or Masson\u2019s Trichrome (Fig. 2).Inflammation (as evidenced by DAD) was evaluated on day 9 andfibrosis was evaluated on day 14. All untreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice developed a viral pneumonia including symptomsand histological features of ARDS, as previously described [5,6].Specifically, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice developed a signifi-cant diffuse cellular infiltrate leading to DAD and severepneumonia (Fig. 2A; day 9, grade: 2.3 +/20.46). Accompanyingthis DAD are edema, capillary dilation and hemorrhage, and theformation of hyaline membranes (not shown). Those mice thatsurvive the acute phase of the disease develop interstitial fibrosisand intra-alveolar fibrosis (Fig. 2A; day 14, grade: 2.1 +/20.50).In contrast, curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS micedeveloped significantly less of a cellular infiltrate with a patchydistribution and formation of condensed focal lymphocyticaccumulations (Fig. 2A; day 9, grade: 1.31 +/20.44; p,0.05versus reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS). In addition, the intra-alveolarand interstitial fibrosis associated with the late phase of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS was also significantly inhibited by treatment withcurcumin (Fig. 2A; day 14, grade: 1.31 +/20.49; p,0.05 versusreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS). To more clearly demonstrate thepresence of fibrotic lesions histologically, tissue sections werestained with Mason\u2019s Trichrome or Sirius red on day 14 post-infection (Fig. 2B). In normal or saline (control) lung sections,Sirius red or Mason\u2019s Trichrome staining for collagen is evidentonly within the walls of the bronchioles and arterioles, whichcontain connective tissue including collagen, while the lungalveolar airspaces are not stained (Fig. 2B). As can be observed,significant staining for collagen via either Mason\u2019s Trichrome(blue) or Sirius red (bright red) is evident in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice, which is dramatically reduced in curcumin-treatedreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 2B).To support the histological evaluation of fibrosis, the SircolTMCollagen Assay demonstrated significant collagen accumulation inthe lungs at day 14-post infection in untreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice as compared to saline (control) lungs (approximately a2-fold increase) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the amount of collagenaccumulation in the lungs of curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice is significantly reduced versus the reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice, even though they still accumulate more collagen thansaline (control) mice (Fig. 3A). As an additional measure ofcollagen accumulation, mRNA for pro-collagen I was measuredon day 14 post-infection (Fig. 3B). Reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS miceexpressed a significantly higher level of pro-collagen I mRNA ascompared to saline (control) mice, which was significantly reducedin curcumin-treated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 3B).To provide further evidence for the anti-fibrogenic action ofcurcumin in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, we analyzed pulmonaryexpression of TN-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that ishighly expressed in adult lung parenchyma following acute lunginjury [37\u201340] and pulmonary levels of a-SMA and E-cadherin,two well-established markers of epithelial to mesenchymaltransition (Fig. 4). As evaluated by western, TN-C is minimallyexpressed in adult saline (control) lung tissue (Fig. 4A). Inuntreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS lung tissue, the 190-kDaisoform of TN-C is highly expressed on day 14 post-infection.However, in the presence of curcumin, induction of TN-C issignificantly reduced on day 14 post-reovirus 1/L inoculation(Fig. 4A). Western analysis data for TN-C expression wasconfirmed by mRNA expression via qRT-PCR (Fig. 4B). By IF,TN-C expression is minimal in saline (control) lung (Fig. 4C).However, TN-C is highly induced in untreated, reovirus 1/L-Table 1.

In curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice, the presence of TN-C was significantly reduced(Fig. 4C). Similarly by IF, expression of a-SMA was negligible insaline (control) mice being observed only within the walls of thebronchioles and vasculature (Fig. 4C, red). However, a markedinduction of a-SMA expression was observed in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, in agreement with the increased deposition of fibrotictissue (Fig. 4C, red). In contrast, curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice demonstrated a marked reduction in a-SMAexpression (Fig. 4C). The expression of a-SMA was confirmed byprotein expression via western analysis and by mRNA expressionvia qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A and B). In saline (control) lungs, E-cadherinis clearly expressed by the alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 4C, green).However, during post injury, lung remodeling is associated withincreased E-cadherin expression, which occurs simultaneouslywith the peak of cellular proliferation and repair and E-cadherinexpression is reduced in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS (Fig. 4C, green). The expression of E-cadherin wasconfirmed by protein expression via western analysis and bymRNA expression via qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A and B).Administration of Curcumin suppresses serum liverenzyme levels in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDSWe also analyzed changes in liver enzymes to detect hepaticdysfunction as evidence of a systemic response after reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS and whether treatment with curcumin affectedFigure 1.

Serum enzyme analysisindicated an early significant increase in serum AST activity oversaline (control) mice on day 5 post-inoculation in either untreatedor curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice which wasreduced to control levels on day 9 post-inoculation (Fig. 5A).However, on day 14 a significant increase in serum AST activitywas observed in untreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS which wasreduced to control levels in curcumin-treated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 5A). Both serum ALT activity (Fig. 5B) on day14 and AP activity (Fig. 5C) on both days 9 and 14 post-inoculation were significantly increased over saline (control) levelsin reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice that was reduced to controllevels in curcumin-treated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice.Curcumin modulates the Phenotype of the InflammatoryCellular Infiltrate in Reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS MiceTo determine the percentage over time of different leukocytesubsets present in the inflammatory infiltrate, infiltrating cells fromwhole lung preparations were obtained on days 5, 9, and 14 postreovirus 1/L inoculation and analyzed by flow cytometry usingmonoclonal Abs specific for T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), B cells(CD19), Macrophages (CD11b), neutrophils (GR-1), and NK cells(CD49B (pan-NK)) (Fig. 6). In saline or saline + curcumin-treated(control) mice, approximately 0.77+/20.206106 cells wererecovered from the interstitial spaces with macrophages andPMNs being the predominate cells present (Table 2; not shown). Asignificant increase in the total number of inflammatory cells wasrecovered from either untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS orcurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice on days 5, 9, or14 as compared to saline or saline + curcumin-treated (control)mice (Table 2). Further, the number of recovered cells on days 5and 14 from curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice wassignificantly less than the number recovered from untreatedreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS (Table 2). In regards to phenotype, asignificant decrease in the number of PMNs (GR1+) and CD4+cells on day 5 and CD19+B cells on day 9 was observed incurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice versus untreatedreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 6A and B). On day 14, ascompared to reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, a significant decrease inPMNs, NK cells, CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells was observed incurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 6C).To determine whether the cytokine/chemokine expressionprofile of the infiltrating cells from reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS micewas modulated during curcumin treatment, RNA from infiltratingcells on days 5, 9, and 14 was evaluated for expression of keycytokines/chemokines including IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, G/M-CSF,and MCP-1 via qRT-PCR (Fig. 7). Interestingly, an earlysignificant increase in the expression of IL-6, G/M-CSF andMCP-1 was observed on day 5 in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS as compared to untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDSmice or saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). However, by day 9 post-inoculation, the expression of IL-6, G/M-CSF and MCP-1 wassignificantly higher in both untreated versus curcumin treatedreovirus 1/l-ALI/ARDS mice as compared to saline (control) mice(Fig. 7A). In addition, on day 9 the expression of IFNc, wassignificantly increased in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice as compared to untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDSmice and saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). By day 14 in eitheruntreated or curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, theexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, GM-CSF and MCP-1 weresimilar to that of saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). In addition,cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression from whole lung tissue(including the infiltrating cells) was also evaluated on days 9 and 14post-inoculation by qRT-PCR. Expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc,and MCP-1 was significantly increased over saline (control) in bothuntreated and curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS on day9 post-inoculation (Fig. 7B). However, at day 14 post-inoculation,the expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1 in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice was still significantly increased over saline(control) mice, which was significantly inhibited in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 7B).Curcumin differentially modulates the TGF\u00df1 NFkB, andthe p38 signaling pathwaysThree key pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, TGF\u00df1, NFkB, and p38 were investigated in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS. RNA from whole lung tissue on days 9 and 14 postinoculation was evaluated for expression of TGF\u00df1 and TGF\u00df RIIby RT-PCR or qRT-PCR (Fig. 8) and protein extracts from wholelung tissue were evaluated for expression of the phosphorylatedform of the p65 subunit of NFkB or the phosphorylated form ofp38, an additional key molecule in the TGF\u00df signaling pathway(Fig. 9). While the expression of TGF\u00df1 was not modulated bycurcumin on either day 9 or day 14 in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS(Fig. 8A and B), TGF\u00df RII, which is required for TGF\u00df signaling,was significantly reduced on day 9 in the presence of curcumin(Fig. 8B). Curcumin also demonstrated differential effects onexpression of the phosphorylated (P) forms of p38 and the p65Figure 5.

Treatment of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDSwith curcumin resulted in a significant increase in P-p38 evidenton day 9 post-inoculation as compared to untreated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS (Fig. 9A and B). However, treatment of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS with curcumin resulted in a significant reduction of P-p65 NFkB as compared to untreated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS(Fig. 9A and B).DiscussionThis study was conducted in a mouse model of infection(reovirus 1/L)-induced acute viral pneumonia, which leads to ARDS,the most severe form of ALI. Reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS micedemonstrated severely damaged lungs as evidenced by DADfollowed by infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar spaces withfibroblasts with excessive collagen deposition [5\u20138]. However, inreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS undergoing treatment with curcumin ina pre-clinical model, these inflammatory and fibrotic changes weresignificantly reduced. Key markers of fibrosis including expressionof a-SMA, TN-C and E-cadherin were modified by curcumin.Curcumin also modulated the expression of key chemokines/cytokines implicated in the development of ALI/ARDS includingIL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1 from both the inflammatoryinfiltrate and from whole lung tissue potentially through themodulation of NFkB. While the expression of TGF\u00df1 was notmodulated by curcumin, TGF\u00df RII, which is required for TGF\u00dfsignaling, was significantly reduced. In reovirus 1//L-ALI/ARDS,we also observed dramatic increases in systemic levels of liverenzymes including AST, ALT, and AP especially on day 14 whensignificant fibrotic lesions are observed. This is similar to manypatients with ARDS who die not from hypoxemia but frommultiple organ failure [41,42]. However, curcumin-treated reovi-rus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice demonstrated a significant decrease isall three systemic indicators suggesting that curcumin prevents notonly the inflammatory reaction but also the later systemicreactions due to continued lung fibrosis and hypoxemia. We alsodemonstrate in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS an increase in expressionof a\u0303SMA and TN-C especially visible in areas of lung injury inagreement with the increased deposition of fibrotic tissue. Incontrast, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice treated with curcumindemonstrated a marked reduction in a-SMA and TN-C. Thesedata confirm that curcumin induces anti-fibrogenic actions, relatedat least in part to a lower accumulation of myofibroblasts duringthe course of the fibrogenic process. Our results also suggest thatthe curcumin further manifests its effects through the induction ofthe p38 MAPK, a subfamily of serine-threonine protein kinases,having pro-apoptotic effects in response to extracellular stimuli[43]. Since the effects of curcumin are likely pleotropic andcomplex, determining the downstream effectors of curcumin willbe crucial in analyzing the full potential value of curcumin as apotential therapeutic.In this report, we demonstrate a differential effect of curcuminon the inflammatory infiltrate versus whole lung tissue, whichwould include an inflammatory response associated with residentepithelial, endothelial and/or fibroblast cells. We demonstratefrom the inflammatory infiltrate an early (day 5) and significantrise in IL-6, G/M-CSF, and MCP-1 in curcumin-treated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS which is not mirrored by untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS until day 9. In addition, on day 9, IFNc expressionFigure 6. Administration of curcumin modulates the inflammatory cell infiltrate during reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS.

These results suggest a consistent andprolonged inflammatory response most likely initiating fromresident pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts inuntreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, contributed to the pathologyassociated with ALI/ARDS. We have previously demonstrated arole for IFNc in the pathophysiology of reovirus 1/L pulmonarypathologies and suggest that prolonged and high levels of IFNc areassociated with more severe pulmonary pathologies [7,8]. Thereduced pathology associated with curcumin treatment and thereduced expression of IFNc by curcumin would support thishypothesis. We have also demonstrated the potential effect ofcurcumin on NFkB activation by a decrease in the levels of the P-p65. This result is clearly consistent with the decreased expressionof IFNc and MCP-1, which is observed in curcumin-treatedreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS. The literature clearly links canonicalactivation of NFkB in cells to the pathogenesis of inflammatorydiseases [44\u201348]. NFkB is activated in the lungs of patients withALI [49,50] and persistent elevation of NFkB in patients withsepsis-induced ALI is associated with poor outcome [51,52].Curcumin has been demonstrated to modulate NFkB activation incell systems as well as in vivo model systems [16,18,53\u201357]. As ananti-inflammatory agent in association with lung diseases curcu-min inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-1,and TNF through the inhibition of the transcription factors NFkBand AP-1 [26,28]. However, although NFkB plays a major role inregulating expression of cytokines/chemokines, the effects ofcurcumin in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS cannot solely be attributedto its effect on NFkB since glucocorticoids also inhibit NFkB butdo not suppress the development, progression, and mortalityassociated with reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS [7,8].TGF\u00df and its signaling pathways have also been implicated inlung fibrosis [58\u201360] and TGF\u00df over expression is associated withpoorer prognosis in ARDS [61\u201363] as well as in our model [5,6].While curcumin has been demonstrated to reduce collagen inexperimental pulmonary fibrosis induced by cyclophosphamide,whole-body irradiation, and bleomycin, little mechanistic studieshave been performed [20,22\u201327,64,65]. Here, we demonstrate inreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS that while treatment with curcumin didnot inhibit the expression of TGF\u00df1 itself, expression of TGF\u00df RIIwas significantly reduced especially on day 9 post-induction wherethe transition between inflammation and fibrosis is most evident.Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, in otherpulmonary fibrotic models including in bleomycin-induced fibrosis[22,25,66\u201369], in SiO2-induced fibrosis [70], and in amiodarone-induced fibrosis [23], curcumin has been shown to reduce eitherTGF\u00df protein or mRNA expression. In amiodarone-inducedfibrosis, this reduction in TGF\u00df is potentially through a decreasein c-Jun expression [23]. Aberrant activation of TGF\u00df signalinghas also been implicated in scleroderma fibrosis [20,21,71,72] andin keloid, a fibrotic disease characterized by abnormal accumu-lation of ECM in the dermis via reduction in TGF\u00df/p-SMAD-2[73]. Over expression of TGF\u00df has also been implicated in fibrotickidney disease and curcumin inhibited TGF\u00df signaling andreduced TGF\u00df induced increases in PAI-1, TGF\u00df1, collagen,and fibronectin through a reduction in both TGF\u00df RII andphosphorylation of Smad2/3 in renal cells [74,75]. In hepaticfibrosis curcumin activated PPARc which contributed to apoptosisand a reduction in extracellular matrix expression in hepaticstellate cells through the interruption of TGF\u00df signaling andsuppression of CTGF [76\u201378].There is convincing evidence in patients that increased lungepithelial apoptosis is associated with poor outcomes in ALI/ARDS [51,79\u201381]. Pathways involving both the p38 MAP or Aktkinases are important in PMNs and macrophages, the majorinfiltrating cells in ALI/ARDS [49,50,82]. Diminished transloca-tion of NFkB and phosphorylation of Akt but not p38 in PMNs ofpatients with sepsis-induced ALI was associated with improvedsurvival [49]. It has also been demonstrated that activation of p38MAPK or an increase in caspase-3 activity appears to contributeto the proapoptotic effect of human neutrophil apoptosis bycurcumin [83]. Curcumin has been shown to modulate apoptosisin a number of different cell types. In scleroderma, it was shownthat scleroderma lung fibroblasts, which are deficient in PKCe, aresensitive to curcumin-induced apoptosis, whereas normal lungfibroblasts are insensitive to curcumin [20,21]. The importance ofFigure 9. Administration of curcumin modulates the phosphorylation status of the p65 subunit of NFkB and p38 MAPK. CBA/J micewere inoculated i.n. with 107 PFU reovirus 1/L and were either untreated (2) or treated (+) with 50 mg/kg curcumin by i.p. injection beginning 5 daysprior to infection and daily, thereafter. (A) On day 9 post-inoculation, protein was extracted from whole lung tissue from untreated (2) or curcumin-treated (+) reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice and analyzed for the expression of phosphorylated p38 (P-p38) and phosphorylated p65-NFkB (P-p65-NFkB)by western analysis.

In pleural mesothelioma cells,curcumin was shown to activate p38 MAPK, caspases 9 and 3,caused elevated levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax, stimulatedPARP cleavage, and induced apoptosis [84]. Curcumin has alsobeen shown to attenuate gefitinib-induced cell proliferation andenhances apoptosis through altering p38 MAPK activation inintestinal epithelia cell [85]. In the reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDSmodel, we have clearly demonstrated a role for apoptosis inreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS [9]. Although we demonstrated bothapoptosis of the alveolar epithelium via TUNEL analysis and theup regulation of Fas and FasL in situ in alveolar epithelium and incells of the inflammatory infiltrate, modulation of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS was not linked to the inhibition of the Fas/FasLpathway suggesting the involvement of additional apoptosispathways [9]. Here, we demonstrate in curcumin-treated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS, an increase in P-p38, which has been linked toenhanced PMN apoptosis. While we demonstrated a significantdecrease in the total number of infiltrating cells and a decrease inthe number of PMN on day 14 in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, whether this decrease is reflected in an increase inapoptosis is yet to be determined.In conclusion, our model provides a very relevant model forinfection (viral)-induced ALI/ARDS and for deciphering themechanism(s) of action of agents that show promising efficacyagainst ALI/ARDS such as the potent anti-inflammatory agent,curcumin. Our data strongly support the hypothesis in a pre-clinical model that treatment of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS withcurcumin inhibits the host inflammatory response potentiallythrough the modulation of cytokine/chemokine expressionthrough the NFkB pathway as well as the host fibrotic responseduring the regeneration phase of the disease through modulationof the TGF\u00df pathway. Our results also suggest that curcumin maymodulate apoptosis pathways mediated through the p38 MAPKpathway. Thus, understanding curcumin\u2019s mechanism of actionmay elucidate compounds that would further improve it\u2019sinhibitory activity in an additive or synergistic manner leadingto combination studies involving curcumin and other anti-viralagents and/or anti-fibrotic agents. A water soluble curcumincomplex has recently been described that attenuated multiplemarkers of inflammation and injury, including pulmonary edemaand neutrophil infiltration in an ALI model [86]. An additionalstudy demonstrated the potential use of curcumin as an adjuncttherapy as an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory agent alongwith antibiotics in the case of acute lung infection induced by K.pneumonia [87]. We are currently conducting additional exper-iments to characterize the mechanism of curcumin\u2019s affect onfibrotic lesion development in a therapeutic model. We havepreliminary histological data that demonstrates treatment ofreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice with curcumin beginning on day7 post reovirus 1/L infection (after the onset of inflammation butbefore significant development of fibrotic lesions) inhibits fibroticlesion development as evaluated on day 14 (unpublished results).Thus, continued studies of the potent anti-oxidant, anti-microbial,anti-inflammatory agent, curcumin, will likely improve theidentification of key study endpoints that may be manipulated toslow or reverse the relentless progression of pulmonary inflam-mation/fibrosis in acute viral-induced ALI/ARDS, ultimately,leading to new novel treatments to reduce pulmonary dysfunctionand improve outcome for critically ill patients.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Ms. Lindsey Bishop-Jutzeler for assistancewith the tenascin-C western.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: SA FZ SDL LL.
