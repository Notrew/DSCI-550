Carson, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, and approved November 8, 2013 (received for review October 15, 2013)Expression of receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM),a breast cancer susceptibility gene, is tightly controlled in normaltissues but elevated in many tumors, contributing to tumorigenesisand metastases. However, how the expression of RHAMM is regu-lated remains elusive. Statins, inhibitors of mevalonate metabolicpathway widely used for hypercholesterolemia, have been foundto also have antitumor effects, but little is known of the specifictargets and mechanisms. Moreover, Hippo signaling pathway playscrucial roles in organ size control and cancer development, yet itsdownstream transcriptional targets remain obscure. Here we showthat RHAMM expression is regulated by mevalonate and Hippopathways converging onto Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD,which binds RHAMM promoter at specific sites and controls itstranscription and consequently breast cancer cell migration andinvasion (BCCMI); and that simvastatin inhibits BCCMI via targetingYAP-mediated RHAMM transcription. Required for ERK phosphor-ylation and BCCMI, YAP-activated RHAMM transcription is depen-dent on mevalonate and sensitive to simvastatin, which modulateRHAMM transcription by modulating YAP phosphorylation and nu-clear-cytoplasmic localization. Further, modulation by mevalonate/simvastatin of YAP-activated RHAMM transcription requires gera-nylgeranylation, Rho GTPase activation, and actin cytoskeletonrearrangement, but is largely independent of MST and LATS kinaseactivity. These findings from in vitro and in vivo investigations linkmevalonate and Hippo pathways with RHAMM as a downstreameffector, a YAP-transcription and simvastatin-inhibition target, anda cancer metastasis mediator; uncover a mechanism regulatingRHAMM expression and cancer metastases; and reveal a modewhereby simvastatin exerts anticancer effects; providing potentialtargets for cancer therapeutic agents.metabolism | actin assembly | oncogene | tumor suppressor | crosstalkBreast cancer is by far the most frequent cancer in womenworldwide, ranking second among all cancers, and is oneof the most deadly cancers (1). Unraveling the molecular andcellular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression andmetastasis is critical for development of therapeutic agentsto treat this deadly disease. Receptor for hyaluronan (HA)-mediated motility (RHAMM), also known as HMMR, IHABP,or CD168, has been identified as a breast cancer susceptibilitygene (2, 3), with dual oncogenic functions as HA receptor andmitotic spindle binding protein (4, 5). RHAMM is generally notdetected in homeostatic tissues, and is transiently produced duringwound repair, but its hyperexpression is associated with tumordevelopment, progression, and metastasis (2, 6). Overexpression ofRHAMM causes transformation and promotes breast cancer cellmigration and invasion (BCCMI), and its expression is up-regu-lated in a variety of human tumors, including breast and endo-metrial carcinomas (6\u20138), gastrointestinal cancers (9, 10), prostatecancer (11), aggressive fibromatosis (i.e., desmoid tumor) (12), lungand liver cancer (13, 14), glioma (15), and B-cell malignancies (16,17). RHAMM binds to mitotic spindles and promotes interphasemicrotubule instability and mitotic spindle integrity (18, 19).Uniquely, it is also unconventionally exported onto extracellularsurface to partner with CD44, thereby enhancing CD44-mediatedtumor progression via ERK1/2 association, and maintaining highproliferative activities and motility of invasive cancer cells (20,21). Thus, expression of RHAMM is critical for its normal andoncogenic functions, but how it is regulated remains obscure.Statins are specific inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-methylglutarylCoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting,mevalonate-making step in the mevalonate pathway for the bio-synthesis of isoprenoids and downstream products. The mevalonatepathway is biologically very important because the isoprenoids itproduces play vital roles in multiple cellular functions, includingprotein posttranslational modifications such as geranylgeranylationSignificanceHow receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) ex-pression is regulated, how statins exert anticancer effects, andwhat roles mevalonate and Hippo pathways play in tumors areimportant issues in cancer biology. We find that the twopathways converge onto Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD tocontrol RHAMM transcription leading to ERK activation andcancer metastasis, which is inhibited by simvastatin. YAP/TEADbinds RHAMM promoter at specific sites to activate RHAMMtranscription, and mevalonate/simvastatin affects RHAMMtranscription by modulating YAP phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. These in vitro and in vivo findingsidentify a mechanism regulating RHAMM expression and can-cer metastasis wherein RHAMM is a downstream effector ofmevalonate/Hippo pathways, and a YAP/TEAD-transcriptionand simvastatin-inhibition target, revealing interesting in-terplay of the pathways and potential targets for cancertherapeutic agents.Author contributions: Z.W., Y.W., and L.H. designed research; Z.W., Y.W., H.W., Y.

As potent block-ers of the mevalonate pathway and biosynthesis of cholesterol,statins have long been used to treat hypercholesterolemia andprevent cardiovascular diseases (22). Remarkably, statins haverecently been found to also have multiple anticancer effects suchas antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiinvasive, and radiosensitizingproperties, making them promising therapeutic agents against manycancers, including mammary carcinoma (22, 23). Several potentialmechanisms have been suggested to explain the anticancer activitiesof statins. Statins could trigger tumor-specific apoptosis by blockingprotein geranylgeranylation, leading to disrupted membrane local-ization and function of the Ras superfamily including CDC42 andRac and Rho GTPase (22, 23), as well as disorganization ofactin stress fibers (24). Simvastatin was shown to foster en-hanced expression of mutant p53 to down-regulate CD44 ex-pression, therefore preventing breast cancer cell metastasis tobone (25). Furthermore, simvastatin inactivated NF-\u03baB, leading toderepression of PTEN and repression of Bcl-xl to prevent breastcancer cell growth (26). Notably, it was recently demonstrated thatthe mevalonate pathway is necessary and sufficient to maintainthe malignant state of breast cancer cells in 3D culture (27).However, specific antitumor targets and mechanisms of statinsare poorly understood.The Hippo pathway, with the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) as its downstream effector, is highlyconserved from Drosophila to mammals and critical in controllingorgan size, tissue regeneration, and stem cell self-renewal (28,29). Recently, the Hippo\u2013YAP pathway has been demonstratedto be involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression (30, 31).Regulated by cell density, shape, and actin cytoskeleton, themammalian Hippo pathway consists of a core kinase cascade inwhich Mst1 or Mst2 forms a complex with the adaptor proteinWW45 and phosphorylates the LATS1/2 kinases and anotheradaptor protein MOB (32\u201334). The LATS/MOB complex sub-sequently phosphorylates YAP (at Ser127) and its paralog TAZ(at Ser89), leading to their cytoplasmic retention and repression(28, 30, 35). YAP protein level and activity are regulated atmultiple levels by several additional regulators, including theFERM domain proteins Merlin/NF2 (neurofibromatosis 2) andFRMD6 and protein phosphatases PP2A and ASPP1 (28, 30, 35).YAP can promote metastasis through interacting with the TEAD/TEF transcription factors, and increased YAP/TEAD activityplays a causal role in cancer progression and metastasis (36).YAP has been demonstrated as a driving oncogene on amplicon11q22, which is amplified in several human tumors (37). Up-regulation of YAP and its nuclear localization strongly correlatewith poor prognosis and tumor progression in multiple cancers,including breast (38), lung, colorectal, ovarian, and liver carci-nomas (39). Overexpression of YAP in a conditional YAPtransgenic mouse model led to tissue overgrowth and tumor-igenesis (40). Furthermore, mutation or epigenetic silencingof several components of the Hippo pathway, including NF2,LATS1/2, MST1/2, WW45, MOB, and KIBRA, have beenassociated with several human cancers (30, 35, 41). Together, thesestudies highlight a pivotal role of the Hippo\u2013YAP pathway incancer development and progression, but the transcriptional tar-gets remain unclear. Moreover, it is unknown how the roles of theHippo pathway, mevalonate pathway, statin action, and RHAMMare related in tumor development and progression.Thus, how the expression of the oncogene RHAMM is regulated,whether and how the mevalonate metabolic pathway and Hipposignaling pathway interact in cancer metastasis, and how the statindrugs exert anticancer effects are important outstanding issues incancer biology and therapy. In the present study, we have sought toaddress these and related issues in the context of breast cancer. Wehave focused on molecular and cellular investigations by usinga couple of highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines and a nontumorcell line, and conducted selective and relevant in vivo investigationswith human breast tumor tissues and its xenografts mouse model, asprevious animal model studies had established that the metastasis ofbreast cancer was inhibited by simvastatin (25). We find that themevalonate pathway promotes, and simvastatin inhibits, the expres-sion of RHAMM, which is necessary for ERK phosphorylation andBCCMI, via a transcriptional mechanismmediated directly by YAP.With two previously unrecognized TEAD binding sites in its pro-moter, RHAMM is demonstrated as a unique transcriptionaltarget of YAP-TEAD. Mevalonate or simvastatin modulatesRHAMM transcription through regulating the phosphoryla-tion and nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of YAP, thedownstream effector of the Hippo pathway. In vivo experi-ments and analysis show that RHAMM and YAP are overex-pressed in human breast invasive ductal carcinoma, and thatsimvastatin inhibits expression of RHAMMand activation of YAPand ERK in human breast tumor xenografts in mice. Our findingstherefore identify RHAMM as a direct transcriptional target ofYAP and a downstream action target of simvastatin, and revealinteresting interplay between the mevalonate metabolic pathwayand the Hippo signaling pathway, in breast cancer metastasis.Fig. 1. RHAMM is essential for BCCMI, and the mevalonate pathway reg-ulates RHAMM expression, ERK activation, and BCCMI.

Student two-tailed t test was used for statisticalanalysis (*P < 0.05).E90 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319190110 Wang et al.www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319190110ResultsRHAMM Expression and RHAMM-Mediated ERK Activation andBCCMI Are Promoted by the Mevalonate Pathway and Attenuatedby Simvastatin. BCCMI has been shown to be inhibited by sim-vastatin (25), and our experiments of transwell migration assaysusing MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumor cells and 4T1 mousemammary tumor cells confirmed this observation (Fig. S1). Assimvastatin is a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzymeHMGCR in the mevalonate pathway, we tested whether the in-hibition of migration is caused by disturbance of the mevalonatepathway. Indeed, this inhibition was reversed by addition of meval-onate (Fig. S1A andC). In vitro invasion assay usingMatrigel-coatedTranswell inserts further confirmed the effects of simvastatin andmevalonate (Fig. S1 B andD), showing that the mevalonate pathwayplays an essential role in regulating BCCMI, which is blockedby simvastatin.As the oncogenic protein RHAMM is reported to overexpressand act as a cell surface receptor to promote BCCMI throughforming complexes with CD44 and ERK1/2 (20), we investigatedthe direct relationship between RHAMM protein and the migra-tion and invasion in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Two independentlentivirus-mediated shRNAs directed toward RHAMM down-regulated the expression of RHAMM protein (Fig. 1A), and sig-nificantly inhibited the migration (Fig. 1B) and invasion (Fig. 1C)of MDA-MB-231 cells in transwell assays. In the same time frame,knockdown of RHAMM did not significantly affect cell growth ofMDA-MB-231. These results demonstrate that RHAMM is es-sential in promoting the motility and aggression of the breastcancer cells, and, taken together with the preceding results, raisedthe possibility that the mevalonate pathway and RHAMM areconnected, as they are both involved in the regulation of BCCMI.To test this hypothesis, we measured the mRNA and pro-tein levels of RHAMM by using real-time RT-PCR andWestern blot, respectively, with and without the interferenceof the mevalonate pathway. Both mRNA and protein levels ofRHAMM were markedly reduced after the cells were treatedby simvastatin, whereas adding mevalonate abolished the in-hibitory effect of simvastatin on RHAMM expression inMDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1 D and E) and 4T1 (Fig. 1 F and G) cells.Moreover, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by simvastatinmarkedly down-regulated the activity of RHAMM promoter asindicated by reporter gene expression (Fig. 1H), whereas addingmevalonate restored the promoter activity of RHAMM. Theseresults indicate that RHAMM expression is positively regulatedby the mevalonate pathway and targeted by simvastatin inhibitionthrough a transcriptional mechanism.That RHAMM expression is regulated by mevalonate path-way suggests that RHAMM is involved in mevalonate pathway-mediated regulation of BCCMI. RHAMM has been shown toform a complex with ERK1/2 to maintain the activity of ERK1/2 in breast cancer cells, which promoted the motility of invasivebreast cancer cells (20). Consistently, we found that down-regu-lation of RHAMM expression by lentivirus-mediated shRNAinhibited ERK activity by reducing the phosphorylation level ofERK (Fig. 1I). In addition, simvastatin reduced the phosphory-lation level of ERK, whereas mevalonate rescued the inhibition bysimvastatin (Fig. 1J and Fig. S2). These results suggest thatRHAMM-mediated ERK activation is required for the mevalonatepathway-promoted, simvastatin-inhibited BCCMI. That down-regulation of RHAMM expression by shRNA and by simvastatinhad equivalent effect on ERK activation and BCCMI indicates thatthe effect of mevalonate pathway or simvastatin on BCCMI is in-deed mediated through RHAMM expression and ERK activation.RHAMM Is a Direct Transcriptional Target Gene of YAP-TEAD of theHippo Pathway. As the mevalonate pathway and simvastatinappeared to modulate RHAMM expression at the transcrip-tional level, we next tried to identify the transcription factor(s)that mediated this effect. We analyzed the RHAMM promoterregion by using MatInspector (Genomatix) and found it harborstwo putative binding sites (\u201cGGAATG\u201d) for the transcriptionfactor TEAD at the nucleotide positions of \u2212291 to \u2212285 (TEADbinding site 1, TB1) and \u2212103 to \u221297 (TEAD binding site 2, TB2)of the transcription start site (Fig. 2A). TEAD-mediated tran-scription is activated upon binding to the transcription coactivatorYAP when the latter is not phosphorylated at Ser127 (28, 29). Toverify physical association of endogenous YAP and TEAD withthe RHAMM promoter sequence in MDA-MB-231 cells, ChIPassay was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B and C, RHAMMpromoter is occupied by YAP and TEAD4 in MDA-MB-231cells. To further test for the binding and direct control ofRHAMM transcription by YAP/TEAD, we separately cloned theWT RHAMM promoter (\u22121830 to 1) and the RHAMM pro-moter mutants with single (\u0394TB1 and \u0394TB2) or double (\u0394TB1/2)TEAD-binding site deletion into the luciferase reporter plasmid.Then, we cotransfected WT or one of the \u0394TB1, \u0394TB2, or \u0394TB1/2 RHAMM reporters with V5-YAP (human YAP expressionplasmid; provided by Makiko Fujii, Aichi Cancer Center ResearchFig. 2.

Thus, this cell line allowsus to observe the effect of increased active YAP on RHAMMtranscription more directly. As shown in Fig. 2D, deletion of singleor both TEAD-binding sites at nucleotide positions \u2212291 to \u2212285and \u2212103 to \u221297 relative to the transcriptional start site dramati-cally decreased the transcriptional activity of the RHAMM pro-moter, and the WT RHAMM luciferase promoter was significantlyactivated by the exogenous V5-YAP, whereas the mutant reporterswere essentially unaffected (Fig. 2D), indicating that the TEAD-binding sites are required for YAP-TEAD binding and RHAMMpromoter activity, and RHAMM reporter transcription is activateddirectly by YAP-TEAD. To further elucidate the contribution ofendogenous YAP and TEAD in controlling the RHAMM pro-moter activity, YAP or TEAD1/3/4 were individually knocked downin MDA-MB-231 cells by shRNA (Fig. 2E). As shown in Fig. 2E,down-regulation of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 repressed RHAMM pro-moter activity markedly, showing that endogenous YAP and TEADare required for RHAMM promoter activity, i.e., transcriptionalactivation of RHAMM reporter gene.We next tested whether YAP/TEAD directly regulates the en-dogenous RHAMM gene expression at the mRNA and proteinlevels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA was usedto knockdown YAP or TEAD1/3/4, and RNAi specificity and effi-ciency were confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3 B, 2 and 3).Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 expression resulted in a dra-matic reduction in RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein levels(Fig. 3 B, 1) in MDA-MB-231 cells. As a positive control, thetranscriptional activation activity of YAP and TEAD was confirmedby the measurement of the mRNA of CTGF, whose expression isknown to depend on YAP-TEAD. Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 caused a significant decrease in CTGFmRNA inMDA-MB-231cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, we overexpressed V5-YAP in HEK293T cells and found that it markedly up-regulated both RHAMMmRNA (Fig. 3D) and protein (Fig. 3E). Taken together, theseresults demonstrate that the transcription coactivator YAP, inpartner with the transcription factor TEAD, directly regulate andare required for transcription of RHAMM.YAP and TEAD Regulate BCCMI Through Control of RHAMM Transcription.As YAP and TEAD depletion repressed transcription of RHAMM,and knockdown of RHAMM expression inhibited ERK phos-phorylation and migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells, we next investigated the involvement of endogenousYAP and TEAD in ERK activity and the cell migration and in-vasion by using lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting YAP orTEAD1/3/4. As shown in Fig. 3, knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4,by short hairpin RNA of YAP (shYAP) or short hairpin RNA ofTEAD1/3/4 (shTEAD1/3/4), resulted in down-regulated ERK ac-tivity (Fig. 3F). Transwell assay showed dramatic inhibition of mi-gration (Fig. 3G) and invasion (Fig. 3H) in shYAP- or shTEAD1/3/4-infected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Reexpression ofRHAMM, as confirmed in Fig. S3, largely rescued the inhibitedmigration (Fig. 3G) and invasion (Fig. 3H) caused by YAP orTEAD1/3/4 knockdown. These results show that YAP and TEADare essential for ERK activity and BCCMI, in accordance withtheir role of directly regulating transcription of RHAMM nec-essary for ERK activation and BCCMI. In other words, YAP/TEAD-controlled transcription of RHAMM is responsible forthe regulation of BCCMI, i.e., the regulation of BCCMI by YAP/TEAD goes through RHAMM expression.Mevalonate Pathway and Simvastatin Regulates YAP Phosphorylationand Cellular Localization to Control RHAMM Transcription. Havingshown that simvastatin attenuates RHAMM transcription via themevalonate pathway and that RHAMM transcription is con-trolled by YAP, we next tried to delineate the mechanismwhereby YAP-mediated RHAMM transcription is regulated bythe mevalonate pathway and simvastatin. YAP activity is knownto depend on its cellular localization which, in turn, is de-termined by its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of YAPat Ser127 induces translocation of YAP from the nucleus tocytoplasm, thus reducing the transcriptional activity of TEAD.Based on these, the phosphorylation status of YAP at Ser127 wasdetected by using a specific antibody with and without the in-hibition of the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin. As shown inFig. 4, simvastatin induced an increase in phosphorylation levelof YAP at Ser127 in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells, and this effectwas abolished by adding mevalonate (Fig. 4 A and B), whichFig. 3. YAP and TEAD are required for RHAMMexpression, ERK activity, and BCCMI, whereas ectopicexpression of RHAMM bypasses the requirement. (Aand B) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 decreasedRHAMM transcription (A) and protein (B) levels.MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with the indicatedshRNA lentiviruses, and RHAMM mRNA (A) and pro-tein (B) levels were determined by real-time RT-PCRand Western blot, respectively.

(G andH) Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 decreased MDA-MB-231 cell migration (G, Left) and invasion (H, Left),whereas reexpression of RHAMM rescued the effects(G and H, Right). Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD ofthree independent experiments. Student two-tailedt test was used for statistical analysis (*P < 0.05and ***P < 0.001).E92 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319190110 Wang et al.http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1319190110/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201319190SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF3www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319190110suggested that the mevalonate pathway or simvastatin modulatesthe transcriptional activity of YAP via regulating its phosphory-lation at Ser127. In fact, simvastatin robustly repressed thetranscription of a YAP target gene CTGF, which contained threeputative YAP-TEAD binding sites, whereas the repression wasreversed by mevalonate (Fig. 4C), indicating specificity of theeffect of simvastatin or mevalonate on YAP. We then examinedthe localization of YAP in the cells treated with simvastatin.Consistent with the increased phosphorylation level of YAP atSer127, simvastatin treatment induced translocation of YAP fromthe nucleus to cytoplasm as visualized by immunofluorescentstaining, whereas adding mevalonate prevented the YAP trans-location (Fig. 4 D and E). Nucleocytoplasmic separation assayfurther confirmed that simvastatin induced the nucleocytoplasmictranslocation of YAP through blockage of the mevalonate pathway(Fig. 4F). Surprisingly, although immunofluorescent images (andtheir quantification) (Fig. 4 D and E) and Western blot of nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionations (Fig. 4F) show that simvastatin causedthe nuclear YAP protein to decrease dramatically, that was ac-companied by a marginal increase in cytoplasmic YAP protein,which suggests that YAP may be degraded upon translocation tothe cytoplasm. Indeed, YAP was significantly polyubiquitinated af-ter the cells were treated by simvastatin, indicating that YAP isdegraded upon translocation to the cytoplasm through the ubiq-uitin\u2013proteasome pathway, whereas adding mevalonate abolishedthe effect of simvastatin (Fig. S4). These results indicate that sim-vastatin promotes YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic seques-tration and degradation to suppress RHAMM transcription. Inaddition, simvastatin significantly reduced the binding of YAP toRHAMM promoter (Fig. 4G), consistent with YAP being seques-tered by simvastatin treatment. Taken together, our results revealpossibly a key mechanism for simvastatin to inhibit the metastasis ofhuman breast cancer, in which simvastatin acts on the mevalonatepathway, which converges with Hippo pathway onto YAP and itstarget gene RHAMM transcription.RHAMM and YAP Are Overexpressed in Human Invasive Breast Tumors,and Simvastatin Attenuates RHAMM Expression and YAP and ERKActivation in Human Breast Tumor Xenografts in Mice. Given therole of YAP and RHAMM in BCCMI, we investigated the ex-pression profile of YAP and RHAMM in human invasive ductalbreast carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry were performed on tis-sue sections from patients with breast cancer. Compared withcancer-adjacent normal breast tissue, YAP and RHAMM areexpressed at much higher levels in the invasive breast tumors, withYAP nuclear staining also observed (Fig. 5A), which is in agree-ment with the in vitro data and the role of and relation betweenYAP and RHAMM. Having shown in cells that simvastatin reg-ulates YAP activity to inhibit RHAMM expression and ERK ac-tivity, we further investigated the in vivo relevance of the in vitroFig. 4. YAP phosphorylation, cytoplasmic localization, and transactivating activity are modulated by mevalonate pathway and simvastatin (Sim). (A and B)Simvastatin significantly inhibited YAP activity (enhanced YAP phosphorylation), whereas adding mevalonate (Meva) abolished the effect in MDA-MB-231 (A)and 4T1 (B) cells.

PNAS | Published online December 23, 2013 | E93CELLBIOLOGYPNASPLUShttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1319190110/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201319190SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF4findings through testing the effects of simvastatin on the YAPphosphorylation, RHAMM expression, and ERK activity inMDA-MB-231\u2013induced tumors in nude mice. Compared withtumors from control mice, mRNA (Fig. 5B) and protein (Fig. 5C)levels of RHAMM were markedly reduced in tumors from sim-vastatin-treated mice whereas the phosphorylation of YAP in-creased and the phosphorylation of ERK decreased (Fig. 5C).These in vivo results are in agreement with and extend our resultsfrom cellular and molecular investigations, and establish the phys-iological and pathological significance for the role of YAP-con-trolled RHAMM expression, the interplay between the mevalonateand Hippo pathways, and the inhibition by simvastatin in in-tervention of BCCMI.Geranylgeranylation Downstream of Mevalonate Is Essential forthe Regulation of YAP Activity, RHAMM Transcription, and ERKActivation. As simvastatin blocks at an upstream step in themevalonate pathway, which encompasses multiple additionaldownstream components as well as branches, we next in-vestigated which of those participate in regulating YAP-mediatedRHAMM transcription leading to BCCMI. Geranylgeranyl py-rophosphate (GGPP) lies downstream of mevalonate in thepathway and is a key precursor molecule for protein prenylationincluding geranylgeranylation. Preventing geranylgeranylation ofRhoA has been suggested as a mechanism for statin-inducedblockade of tumor cell migration and invasion (42). We used a se-lective geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-2133 to testwhether GGPP-dependent geranylgeranylation is involved. In-hibition of geranylgeranyl transferase by GGTI-2133 had a pro-found negative impact on RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 6 A and C) andprotein expression levels (Fig. 6 B and D, Upper), YAP and ERKphosphorylation (Fig. 6 B and D), and cytoplasmic location of YAP(Fig. 6 E and F). These results suggest that geranylgeranylation isrequired to regulate YAP activity, RHAMM transcription, andERK activation. Moreover, to the cells treated with simvastatin,addition of GGPP, which is downstream of mevalonate in thepathway, was sufficient to reverse the effects of simvastatin on YAPactivity (Fig. 6 H and J) and nuclear localization (Fig. 6 K and L),RHAMM expression (Fig. 6 G\u2013J), and ERK activity (Fig. 6 H andJ). These results suggest that geranylgeranylation is indeed an es-sential step downstream of mevalonate in the pathway leading toYAP-dependent RHAMM transcription and BCCMI.Mevalonate Pathway Modulates YAP Phosphorylation via Rho GTPaseActivation and Actin Cytoskeleton Rearrangement Independent ofMST and LATS Kinase Activity. Rho GTPase and actin cytoskele-ton rearrangement have recently been reported to play a role inregulating YAP of the Hippo pathway (33, 34), which bypassesthe core kinase cascade, and the mevalonate pathway has beenshown to control Rho GTPase activity and actin cytoskeletonorganization (24). We next tested whether Rho GTPase andcytoskeleton are involved in the mevalonate pathway-mediatedregulation of YAP activity and RHAMM expression. Similar toprevious work (24), we also observed that simvastatin inhibitedRho activity and disrupted actin cytoskeleton, and these effectscould be rescued by adding mevalonate or GGPP (Fig. S5 A andC). Furthermore, GGTI-2133 inhibited Rho activity and dis-rupted actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S5 B and C). To investigatewhether mevalonate pathway regulated YAP activity throughRho GTPase, lentivirus-mediated constitutively active RhoA(Q63L) was used to infect the cells. Indeed, RhoA (Q63L)-EGFP largely restored the levels of YAP activity, RHAMMexpression, and ERK activity, which had been markedly broughtdown by simvastatin (Fig. 7 A and B). Furthermore, a specificRho inhibitor, C3 transferase, could also mimic simvastatin ef-fect on YAP activity, RHAMM expression, and ERK activity(Fig. 7 C\u2013E). To test whether the actin cytoskeleton is involvedin the regulation of YAP by the mevalonate pathway, we usedchemical (cytoskeleton disrupting reagent cytochalasin D) andphysical (hydrogel) methods to induce actin cytoskeleton change.Similar to simvastatin treatment, disruption of actin cytoskeletonby cytochalasin D and hydrogel increased YAP phosphorylation(Fig. 7E), induced YAP cytoplasmic translocation (Fig. 7C),inhibited RHAMM expression (Fig. 7 D and E), and ERK ac-tivity (Fig. 7E). These data support that Rho GTPase and cy-toskeleton organization downstream of geranylgeranylation arerequired to regulate YAP activity, RHAMM transcription, andERK activation.The core kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST1/2 and LATS1/2,are known to control the phosphorylation level and activity ofYAP. We next investigated whether MST and LATS kinases wereinvolved in mevalonate pathway-mediated regulation of YAP.MDA-MB-231 cells express minimal level of phosphorylatedMST as detected by Western blot (Fig. 7F). The cells weretransfected with Flag-MST2 to boost its MST in the phosphory-lated form. However, the phosphorylation level of MST in theMDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Flag-MST2 was not affectedby the treatment of mevalonate, simvastatin, and simvastatin plusmevalonate (Fig. 7F, lanes 4\u20136 vs. lane 2). The specificity of thephospho (p)-MST antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phosphatasetreatment (Fig. 7F, lane 3 vs. lane 2). We also examined thephosphorylation of endogenous LATS in these treatment set-tings, similar to MST, the phosphorylation level of LATS wasbasically unchanged (Fig. 7G, lanes 3\u20135 vs. lane 1). Also, thespecificity of the p-LATS antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phospha-tase treatment (Fig. 7G, lane 2 vs. lane 1). In addition, Rho in-hibitor C3, cytochalasin D, or hydrogel showed no effect on MSTphosphorylation in the MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Flag-MST2 (Fig. 7F) or the phosphorylation of endogenous LATS(Fig. 7G), which suggests that the mevalonate pathway modulatesYAP phosphorylation and activity via actin cytoskeleton rear-rangement independent of MST and LATS kinase activity.To further confirm the results, lentivirus-mediated shRNAsagainst LATS were used. As shown in Fig. 7 H and I, depletion ofLATS1 or/and LATS2 had marginal effect on YAP phosphory-lation (Fig. 7I), RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 7H) and protein expres-sion (Fig. 7I), and ERK activity (Fig. 7I) induced by simvastatin.Taken together, these data suggest that the core kinase cascade ofthe Hippo pathway is not affected by the mevalonate pathway,and vice versa, and the mevalonate pathway modulates YAPFig. 5. YAP and RHAMM are co-overexpressed in human breast invasivetumors, and simvastatin (Sim) modulates YAP phosphorylation, RHAMMexpression, and ERK activity in the MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor xen-ografts in mice. (A) YAP and RHAMM are both overexpressed in humanbreast invasive ductal carcinoma. Tissue sections from breast invasive ductalcarcinoma and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue were immunostainedwith anti-YAP and anti-RHAMM antibody, and analyzed by light microscopy.(B and C) Simvastatin modulated YAP phosphorylation, RHAMM expression,and ERK activity in the MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor xenografts.

YAP acts directlyon the promoter and regulates the transcription of RHAMM,which modulates the ERK activity and cell motility in the breastcancer cells. In addition, the molecular and cellular findings arecorroborated by results of in vivo investigations.The mevalonate pathway produces isoprenoids that are vitalfor many cellular functions, including cholesterol synthesis andgrowth control (22). Tumor cell metabolism is regulated by themevalonate pathway as a number of components or metabolicproducts in this pathway, including HMGCR, mevalonate, cho-lesterol, and isoprenoids, have been linked to tumor progression(23). HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonatepathway, is a candidate metabolic oncogene reportedly to de-regulate in several types of cancers (43). In patients with breastcancer, high messenger RNA levels of HMGCR, among otherfour mevalonate pathway genes, are found to correlate with poorprognosis (23). Mutant p53 can significantly up-regulate meval-onate metabolism and protein prenylation through promotingtranscription of genes encoding mevalonate pathway enzymes,including HMGCR in carcinoma cells, which contribute to themaintenance of the malignant phenotype (27). In addition,HMGCR apparently cooperates with RAS in promoting thetransformation of WT primary mouse embryonic fibroblastsFig. 6. Geranylgeranylation downstream of mevalonate pathway mediates regulation of YAP activity, RHAMM expression, and ERK activity.

PNAS | Published online December 23, 2013 | E95CELLBIOLOGYPNASPLUS(43). We found that the mevalonate pathway affects the migrationand invasionofMDA-MB-231 and4T1breast cancer cells (Fig. 1 andFig. S1). Inhibiting the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin down-regulates RHAMM expression and suppress BCCMI, whereasadding mevalonate reverses the suppression of RHAMM as well asthe migration and invasion caused by the simvastatin, demonstratinga role of the mevalonate pathway in controlling breast cancer me-tastasis via RHAMM.It has long been recognized that intervening with the meval-onate pathway may be useful for certain cancer treatments (44).Statins, a class of HMGCR inhibitors that block the mevalonatepathway at its rate-limiting step, are clinically used to treat cardio-vascular and cerebrovascular diseases. They have gained increasingrecognition as anticancer agents and exhibited anticancer activity ina variety of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models (22, 23). Besidepreclinical and some clinical observations, epidemiologic data sug-gest that statins can lower the risk of certain cancers by as much as50%. Those promising preclinical results have led to at least 18reported phase I and I/II clinical trials (23). In breast cancer, statinsprevented metastasis by inhibiting CD44 expression through pro-moting p53 expression (25). Statins enhance the effects of a numberof chemotherapeutic drugs with only a few exceptions, and alsoincrease the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of multidrug resistancecells. In tumor-bearing mice, statins used in combination treatmentsshow the additional advantageous effects of attenuated cardiotox-icity and reduced kidney or liver damage, although these effects arestill waiting to be verified in clinical trials (43). Our present resultsfurther show that simvastatin is able to down-regulate key factors intumor formation and progression, particularly metastasis, and thushas valuable therapeutic benefits for cancer treatment.As our results showed that RHAMM is a downstream targetregulated by the mevalonate pathway, we then set out to search forthe factors that may regulate the promoter activity of RHAMM.Surprisingly, we found that key components of the Hippo signalingpathway, namely YAP and TEAD, directly control the transcriptionof RHAMM. Moreover, we found that the mevalonate pathwayregulates the expression of RHAMM through impacting on theHippo pathway and its downstream effectors YAP and TEAD.Highly conserved in mammals, the Hippo pathway is known toplay a key role in organ size control and tissue regeneration, andto be involved in embryonic development, stem cell differentia-tion, and control of proliferation, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal tran-sition, and tumorigenesis. Deregulation of the Hippo pathwayinduces tumors in model organisms and occurs in many humancarcinomas, including lung, colorectal, ovarian, and liver cancer(39). The core mammalian Hippo pathway is a kinase cascadeconsisting of MST1/2, Sav1, Lats1/2, and Mob1, which phos-phorylates and inhibits YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ in conjunction withTEAD1\u20134 mediates major physiological functions of the Hippopathway. TEADs contain in the N-terminal region a conservedTEA domain for recognizing and binding DNA elements such asGGAATG in the promoter region of target genes (45).We examined the promoter sequence of RHAMM and foundtwo putative TEAD binding sites (TB1 and TB2; Fig. 2A). YAPand its target transcription factor TEAD bind to the TEADbinding sites in RHAMM promoter (Fig. 2 B and C), and YAP/TEAD binding to TEAD-binding sites in RHAMM promoter isrequired for YAP-mediated RHAMM transcriptional activation(Fig. 2 D and E), consistent with the previous report that YAP/TEAD interaction and activity plays causal roles in cancer pro-gression and metastasis (36). Moreover, knockdown of YAP orTEAD in MDA-MB-231 cells induced a dramatic reduction ofRHAMM expression in mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3 A andB). Taken together, these data demonstrated RHAMM as a di-rect transcriptional target of YAP.We have further demonstrated that the mevalonate pathwaycontrols YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 and cytoplasmic seques-tration (Fig. 4). Meanwhile, YAP/TEAD is essential to sustain themotility of breast cancer cells, as knockdown of YAP or TEADsignificantly suppressed migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231cells which could be largely rescued by reexpression of RHAMM(Fig. 3 G and H). These and our other results establish animportant and specific role of YAP (Hippo pathway)-regulatedRHAMM in BCCMI, of YAP in RHAMM expression, and ofRHAMM in YAP biology.Furthermore, immunohistochemistry indicated that YAP andRHAMM are overexpressed in human invasive ductal breastcarcinoma (Fig. 5A), and in vivo data also revealed that simvas-tatin modulates YAP phosphorylation, RHAMM expression, andERK activity in the MDA-MB-231\u2013generated tumors in mice (Fig.5 B and C). These findings corroborate our results from in vitroFig. 7. Mevalonate pathway regulates YAP activity, RHAMM expression, andERK activity through Rho GTPase activity and actin cytoskeleton rearrange-ment largely independent of MST and LATS. (A and B) Constitutively activeRhoA (Q63L) rescued RHAMM mRNA expression (A) and RHAMM protein ex-pression, and YAP and ERK activity (B) decreased by simvastatin (Sim). MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with lentivirus-mediated constitutively active RhoA(Q63L)-EGFP, and, 24 h later, treated with simvastatin for another 24 h andanalyzed by real-time RT-PCR (A) and Western blot with the indicated anti-bodies (B). (C\u2013E) Disruption of actin cytoskeleton by various methods inducedtranslocation of YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (C), decrease inRHAMM mRNA level (D), and inhibition of RHAMM protein expression andYAP and ERK activation (E). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with cytochalasinD or C3 transferase for 6 h or cultured on 1 kPa hydrogel for 24 h to disruptactin cytoskeleton assembly, and then fixed and stained with phalloidin(green), YAP antibody (red) and DAPI (blue) for immunofluorescent imaging(C), or analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (D) or Western blot with the indicatedantibodies (E). (F and G) MST phosphorylation (F) or LATS phosphorylation (G)was not modulated by mevalonate pathway/simvastatin, or actin cytoskeleton-disrupting cytochalasin D, C3 transferase, or culturing on 1 kPa hydrogel inMDA-MB-231 cells. (F) Cells were transfected with Flag-MST2 for 24 h and thentreated with the indicated reagents, and cell lysates were immunoblotted withp-MST and Flag antibodies. The specificity of the p-MST antibody wasconfirmed by \u03bb-phosphatase (PPase) treatment (lane 3). (G) Cell lysateswere immunoblotted with p-LATS1 and LATS1 antibodies. The specificityof the p-LATS antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phosphatase treatment (lane2). (H and I) Knockdown of LATS did not affect simvastatin-induced in-hibition of RHAMM mRNA expression (H) or RHAMM protein expressionand YAP and ERK activation (I). MDA-MB-231 cells were infected withthe indicated shRNA lentiviruses, treated with or without simvastatin for24 h, and then analyzed by real-time RT-PCR to determine RHAMM mRNAlevels (H) or Western blot to detect the proteins (I). Data are shown as themean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments.

More im-portantly, our findings reveal a direct link between the mevalonateand the Hippo pathway in controlling tumor progression.In cancers, Hippo pathway is often perturbed through cross-talk with a number of key signaling pathways that frequentlyharbor oncogenic mutations. These major pathways include Wnt,TGF-\u03b2, bone morphogenetic protein, G protein-coupled re-ceptor (GPCR), Hedgehog, insulin\u2013mammalian target of rapamy-cin, and Notch pathways (39). Our present results suggest that, inaddition to these major pathways, the mevalonate pathway interactswith and regulates the Hippo pathway by directly controlling theYAP phosphorylation, cellular localization, and thus its activity.These findings added another layer of complexity to the networksthat can act upon the Hippo pathway, and underscore the vital roleof Hippo pathway as a tumor suppressor that needs to succumb fortumor advancement.We further investigated how the mevalonate pathway inter-plays with the Hippo pathway in regulating YAP activity and thedownstream RHAMM transcription activity. The isoprenoidsfarnesyl pyrophosphate and GGPP are key end products of themevalonate pathway. The isoprenylation process by the afore-mentioned products can posttranslationally modify proteins withC-terminal CAAX, CXC, or CC motifs (23). Isoprenylation isessential for proper localization and activity of the RAS super-family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Amongthese, the Rho family has been closely linked to cancer, as theirderegulated activation drives transformation and their elevatedexpression is associated with several human tumors. RhoA andRhoC are thought to have a role in metastasis. Recent evidencehas linked Rho GTPases to tumor metabolism through activa-tion of glutaminase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamineto glutamate and ammonia, a key step in glutamine metabolismthat contributes to the Warburg phenomenon (23). The activityof these small GTPases depends on the mevalonate pathway, asthey require isoprenylation to function properly. The mevalonatepathway has been reported to lead to geranylgeranylation ofRhoA and its subsequent membrane tethering and activation(22). The Hippo pathway is regulated by GPCR signaling, as cell-surface GPCRs also couple to RhoA GTPase activation, leadingto Lats1/2 inhibition and induction of YAP/TAZ; and RhoAactivation induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which playsimportant roles in the Hippo\u2013YAP cascade (34). Indeed, wefound that geranylgeranylation downstream of the mevalonatepathway is required and sufficient to activate YAP and RHAMMexpression and ERK activation, as selective geranylgeranyl trans-ferase inhibitor significantly inhibited YAP activity, RHAMMexpression, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A\u2013F), and sim-vastatin-induced inhibition was reversed by supplementing withGGPP (Fig. 6 G\u2013L). We have further demonstrated that sim-vastatin disrupted actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, which isrequired for YAP activation and RHAMM transcription (Fig. 7).RhoA has been reported to activate YAP via inhibition ofLATS1/2 but independent of MST1/2 (31) or independent ofboth MST1/2 and LATS1/2 activities (33). We found that themevalonate pathway modulates YAP phosphorylation via actincytoskeleton rearrangement independent of MST and LATS ki-nase activity (Fig. 7 and Fig. S5).RHAMM is poorly expressed in most normal human tissues.RHAMM promotes wound repair, and its expression is increasedduring wound repair in response to hypoxia and fibrogenic factors(5). Its expression is also elevated during the neoplastic progressionof a variety of human tumors. Overexpression of RHAMM istransforming and required for maintaining RAS transformation (6).Consistently, RHAMM is considered a novel breast cancer suscep-tibility gene, and a significant association between homozygousvariation in this gene and early-onset breast cancer has been found(2). Overexpression of RHAMM in patients with primary breastcancer was prognostic of poor outcome in cancer progression. Inparticular, RHAMM expression contributes to the motility andinvasiveness of a tumor cell subpopulation in breast cancers (7).RHAMMoverexpression occurred within subsets of tumor cells inthe primary tumor that was associatedwith lymphnodemetastases.The metastatic tumors showed a significantly higher level ofRHAMM than did the primary tumor. RHAMM is also a tumor-associated antigen found in solid and blood tumors. RHAMMfunctions as cell-surface HA receptor and cytoplasmic mitoticspindle binding protein (4, 5). Itmediates tumorprogression throughCD44 partnership and promotes genomic instability via regulatingthe mitotic spindle/centrosome integrity (18, 19). This RHAMM-regulated activation process results in increased cell-surface expres-sion of CD44 and enhanced activation of ERK1/2. In breast cancer,activation of extracellular HA binding by CD44\u2013RHAMM com-plexes confers malignant potential (20). Importantly, RHAMM ex-pression is down-regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, and theRHAMMpromoter, including thefirst exon and intron,mediates therepression by p53 (46). Our present results show that YAP, a keycomponent of the Hippo signaling pathway, exerts direct regulationon the RHAMM promoter activity. In addition, the mevalonatepathway exerts regulation on the transcription activity of RHAMMby modulating the phosphorylation level and the cytoplasmic locali-zation and degradation of YAP (Fig. 8). Further, we show thatRHAMM and YAP expression correlate with each other\u2014both areelevated in human breast tumors, and our findings at molecular andcellular levels are confirmed in the human tumor mouse model (Fig.5) and are thus physiologically and pathologically significant.In summary, we have found that the mevalonate pathwayand the Hippo pathway interact and converge onto YAP andTEAD to regulate RHAMM transcription and subsequentFig. 8. Model of mevalonate and Hippo pathways regulating YAP-controlledRHAMM transcription and cancer cell motility. Mevalonate pathway regulatesactivity of YAP, the downstream effector of Hippo pathway, which activatestranscription of RHAMM that is required for ERK activation and cancer cell mi-gration and invasion. YAP/TEAD activates RHAMM transcription by binding toRHAMM promoter at two specific TEAD-binding sites. Mevalonate pathwaypromotes and simvastatin inhibits YAP activity, and consequently RHAMM tran-scription, ERK activation, and cancer metastasis, via modulating YAP phosphory-lation and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. The regulation of YAP-mediatedRHAMM transcription and cancer metastasis depends on geranylgeranylation,Rho GTPase activity, and actin cytoskeleton assembly, but not the canonical MST/LATS cascade.Wang et al. PNAS | Published online December 23, 2013 | E97CELLBIOLOGYPNASPLUShttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1319190110/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.201319190SI.pdf?targetid=nameddest=SF5ERK activation and cancer metastasis. YAP/TEAD activatesRHAMM transcription via binding to RHAMM promoter attwo TEAD-binding sites; mevalonate promotes whereas sim-vastatin attenuates RHAMM transcription by modulating YAPphosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution; andgeranylgeranylation, Rho GTPase, and actin cytoskeleton re-arrangement are required for YAP activity and RHAMMtranscription. These findings uncover a mechanism regulatingRHAMM expression and cancer metastasis, wherein RHAMMfunctions as a downstream effector of mevalonate and Hippopathways, a YAP transcriptional target, a simvastatin inhibitiondownstream target, and a mediator of cancer cell motility and in-vasiveness; and also identify a mode whereby simvastatin exertsanticancer metastasis efficacy. These insights are of scientific sig-nificance and therapeutic and clinical potentials.Materials and MethodsDetailed materials and methods and associated references are described in SIMaterials and Methods, which include the following: cell culture, chemicals,plasmids, cell migration and invasion assays, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot,nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction, immunofluorescence micros-copy, ChIP, luciferase reporter gene, lentiviral shRNA, breast tumor animalmodel, immunohistochemistry, and statistical analysis.
