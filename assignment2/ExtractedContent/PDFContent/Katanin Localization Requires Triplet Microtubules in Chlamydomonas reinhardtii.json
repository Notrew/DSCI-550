Albee,Susan K. Dutcher*Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of AmericaAbstractCentrioles and basal bodies are essential for a variety of cellular processes that include the recruitment of proteins to thesestructures for both centrosomal and ciliary function. This recruitment is compromised when centriole/basal body assemblyis defective. Mutations that cause basal body assembly defects confer supersensitivity to Taxol. These include bld2, bld10,bld12, uni3, vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3. Flagellar motility mutants do not confer sensitivity with the exception of mutations in the p60(pf19) and p80 (pf15) subunits of the microtubule severing protein katanin. We have identified additional pf15 and bld2 (e-tubulin) alleles in screens for Taxol sensitivity. Null pf15 and bld2 alleles are viable and are not essential genes inChlamydomonas. Analysis of double mutant strains with the pf15-3 and bld2-6 null alleles suggests that basal bodies inChlamydomonas may recruit additional proteins beyond katanin that affect spindle microtubule stability. The bld2-5 allele isa hypomorphic allele and its phenotype is modulated by nutritional cues. Basal bodies in bld2-5 cells are missing proximalends. The basal body mutants show aberrant localization of an epitope-tagged p80 subunit of katanin. Unlike IFT proteins,katanin p80 does not localize to the transition fibers of the basal bodies based on an analysis of the uni1 mutant as well asthe lack of colocalization of katanin p80 with IFT74. We suggest that the triplet microtubules are likely to play a key role inkatanin p80 recruitment to the basal body of Chlamydomonas rather than the transition fibers that are needed for IFTlocalization.Citation: Esparza JM, O\u2019Toole E, Li L, Giddings TH Jr, Kozak B, et al.

Taxol is used for treatment of avariety of cancers as it blocks mitosis [1]. In the unicellular greenalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Schibler and Huang showed that amutation in b-tubulin (tub2-1) confers resistance to colchicine andsupersensitivity to Taxol. They concluded that the microtubules intub2-1 cells are hyperstabilized, which causes the Taxol supersen-sitive phenotype [2]. Katanin is a microtubule severing protein[3,4]. It is composed of two subunits; the p60 subunit is a catalyticAAA ATPase and the p80 subunit targets the heterodimer to thecentrosome in metazoans. Katanin influences microtubule dy-namics through its ability to sever microtubules. This property isobserved in Drosophila S2 mitotic spindles [5] and C. elegans meioticspindles [6]. Sharma and colleagues [7] showed that loss of eitherthe catalytic (p60) or the targeting (p80) subunit of katanin inTetrahymena results in short cilia and a knockout allele of p60confers Taxol supersensitivity. Thus, there appear to be severalpathways in cells that when mutated confer Taxol sensitivity.Because katanin localizes to the centrosome, this localizationseems likely to require intact centrioles/basal bodies. Centriolesare a component of the metazoan centrosome and help to recruitpericentriolar material (PCM) that nucleates both cytoplasmic andspindle microtubules [8,9]. Functional centrioles and intactsubdistal appendages are required for the recruitment of PCMproteins in animals. SPD-2, SPD-5 and SAS-4, which were firstidentified in C. elegans and localize to centrioles by immuno-electron microscopy, play essential roles in centriole biogenesis andthey are needed to recruit c-tubulin and aurora kinase to the PCM[9\u201311]. Sas-4 is thought to play a key role as it shows binding toab-tubulin dimers [12] as well as with Sas-5 and Cep152/Asl.Recruitment in Drosophila requires Asl (Cep152) and D-Spd2(Cep192) [13]. The SPD-2/Cep192 homolog and centrosomin(Cnn), localizes to the centrioles and spd2 mutants showsignificantly reduced concentrations of several centrosomal pro-teins that include Cnn, c-tubulin, Dd4/Dgrip91, and D-TACC[8,14]. Subdistal appendages on mature centrioles contain ninein[15]. Tissue culture cells depleted of ninein by siRNA show asignificant reduction in c-tubulin and the complete absence of theprotein, astrin, at the centrosome [16]. Thus, defective centriolesor depletion of centriolar proteins prevent recruitment of some orall pericentriolar proteins.When a centriole matures and converts to a basal body, itrecruits intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and motors [17,18].Just as centriolar proteins are required to recruit PCM compo-PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940nents for cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules, defective basalbodies disrupt localization of IFT proteins. In wild-type Chlamy-domonas cells, IFT proteins accumulate around the basal body in ahorseshoe-shaped structure [19,20]. The bld2-1 mutant has anincompletely assembled basal body [21], and although the IFTproteins are present, their localization is diffuse rather than in thehorseshoe-shaped pattern.We reasoned that Chlamydomonas mutants with basal bodydefects that lack the ability to dock intraflagellar transport proteinscorrectly could also fail to localize PCM components properly. Wereport a new phenotype that is associated with basal bodybiogenesis defects; these mutant strains show increased sensitivityto the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol. We hypothesize thatlack of localization or mislocalization of PCM-targeted proteinscontributes to the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype.Strains with basal body integrity defects fall into several classes.The first class shows defects in the assembly of the microtubuleblades and includes bld2, bld10, bld12, uni2 and uni3. The bld2,bld10, and bld12 mutants lack complete microtubule blades, anduni3 mutants lack triplet microtubules [22\u201325]. The uni1 and uni2mutant shows a defect in the transition zone [26,27] and the uni1;uni2 double mutant affects the change from triplet to doubletmicrotubules [28]. The second class of mutants shows defects inthe fibers that are required to maintain proper basal bodyorientation and segregation and include vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3 [29\u201331].We screened existing basal body and flagellar mutants forincreased sensitivity to the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol, aswell as performed several screens for additional mutants thatconfer Taxol sensitivity. We find that katanin mutants inChlamydomonas confer Taxol sensitivity and that mutants withbasal body defects confer Taxol sensitivity, and have abnormalrecruitment of the p80 katanin subunit to the basal bodies.Materials and MethodsCell Culture, Genetic and Phenotypic AnalysesChlamydomonas reinhardtii growth conditions [32], matings [33],and revertant isolation using ultraviolet irradiation [34] wereperformed as previously described. Aflagellate strains were matedwith 100 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,MO) and 30 mM isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (Aldrich, Milwaukee,WI) [33]. For each sample, 200 cells were counted after fixationwith 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Taxol(paciltaxel, Sigma-Aldrich) was tested at concentrations varyingfrom 2 mM to 18 mM in DMSO. Media with Taxol were kept inthe dark for storage and in yellow Lucite boxes during growth toprevent its break down [35]. To determine if cells recovered fromexposure to Taxol, cells were stained with 0.01% Trypan blue(Sigma-Aldrich). Oryzalin was a gift of Eli Lilly and Company.Oryzalin and colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich) were tested at 0.5\u20131 mMand 1\u20135 mM, respectively. The drugs, canavanine, cycloheximide,glyphosate, tunicamycin, methionine sulfoximine, anisomycin,erthyromycin, spectinomycin, 0.1% NP-40, 5-methyl anthranilicacid, and 3-aminopyridine were tested at a 2, 3, and 4 fold higherand lower than in [36]. Cleavage furrow placement measurementswere performed as previously described [34], except ImageJ (NIH)was used to measure the area of the cells. Permutation tests wereperformed using 1000 permutations to determine significance[37].The tub2-1 (b2-tubulin mutant that was first published as colR4,pf15-1, pf19-1, uni2-2, vfl1-1, vfl2-1 and vfl3-1 strains were obtainedfrom the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center. The PF15 vector (pPF15)was obtained from E. Smith (Dartmouth University). The bld10-1and bld12-1 strains were obtained from M. Hirono (University ofTokyo).For synchrony, cells were grown in high salt medium [38] with a14:10 light: dark cycle as described previously [39] at 21uC andwere maintained at a density of 1\u201336105 cells/ml. Samples weretaken at 15 and 30 min time points beginning at 15 min into thedark phase.Mutagenesis and Isolation of new bld2 AllelesTo isolate new alleles by noncomplementation, bld2-2 NIT2ac17/BLD2 nit2-1 AC17 diploid cells were used as previouslydescribed [34]. Diploid cells were grown on rich (R) solid mediumand subjected to 75,000 mJoules/cm2 of ultraviolet irradiation andallowed to recover in the dark for 24 hours. Each plate was dividedinto 12 sections and each section was placed individually into20 ml R liquid medium in 256150 mm culture tubes. Cells at thebottom of the tube were transferred to new tubes containing 20 mlR medium every 2\u20133 days for a total of 12 times and 10 ml fromthe bottom of the last tube was plated onto solid R medium.Individual colonies were picked into 2.5 ml R liquid medium andassayed for their ability to oppose gravity.To differentiate between mutations resulting from chromosomeloss or mitotic recombination, dominant enhancers, and newalleles we took advantage of the absence of a FokI restrictionenzyme site in the bld2-2 allele. PCR amplification of the regionaround the mutation and digestion with the FokI restrictionenzyme produces both the digested wild-type product and uncutbld2-2 product in the heterozygous parental diploid. If mitoticrecombination or chromosome loss occurs, only the bld2-2fragment would be amplified by PCR [34].To isolate new alleles in haploid strains, an insertional mutantcollection with 3000 independent strains, which was a kind giftfrom Dr. Lauren Mets (University of Chicago), was used. It wasconstructed in the CC-125 strain by transformation with the blegene [40]. The collection was screened by replica plating usingRepliPlate pads (FMC, Rockland, ME) onto solid R medium with8 mM Taxol at 25uC. Plates containing Taxol were maintained inyellow Lucite boxes [35].PCR and SequencingGenomic DNA from bld2-5 and bld2-6 cells was isolated using amodified protocol of the Genisol Maxi-Prep Kit (Abgene, Rock-ford, IL). Between 105\u2013106cells were suspended in 50 ml of 1XTris-EDTA buffer with a 100-fold reduction in the suggestedvolumes. Primers for sequencing were described previously andare available upon request. REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) was used with the following conditions: 31 cycles of 1 minat 95uC, 1 min at 57uC and 1 min at 72uC followed by a 10 minextension at 72uC. PCR products were column purified (QIA-GEN, Valencia, CA) and then cycle sequenced using the followingconditions: 2 min at 96uC and 32 cycles of 96uC for 10 sec, 50uCfor 5 sec and 60uC for 4 min. Sequencing reactions wereprecipitated with the addition of 125 mM EDTA and 100%ethanol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT).Reactions were centrifuged, washed with 70% ethanol and driedbefore the addition of Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA). After 2 min incubation at 95uC, the reactionswere loaded onto a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).Sequenced data were aligned and analyzed with Sequencher(Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic DNA from the eightintragenic revertants was isolated and sequenced as describedabove with primers that produce a 367 bp fragment (tns-28-1f;(GTGACAACGGGGAACTAAGC and tns-28-1r:GA-CAGCTGCTGCATTGTGAT).

The PF15 NOT primerscontain the NotI restriction enzyme site and it changes the lastamino acid of PF15 from a leucine to an asparagine. Thesefragments were amplified using Klentaq Long and Accuratepolymerase using the following conditions: 30 cycles of 1 min at95uC, 1 min at 56uC and 1 min at 68uC, followed by a 30 minextension at 68uC. The fragments were purified from a 2%agarose gel (Gel Purification Kit; MO BIO Laboratories Inc.,Carlsbad, CA). The above PCR was repeated using equalquantities of each PCR product and the PF15 FRAG primers toincorporate a NotI restriction site that was used to clone the HA taginto the gene (Figure S1). The resulting approximately 500 bpfragment was gel purified and cloned into the pCR4-TOPOvector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformed colonies wereverified by colony PCR and used to isolate plasmid DNA with theFigure 1. Basal body mutant strains show supersensitivity to Taxol.

The PF15 fragment with the incorporated NotI site(pPF15-N) was digested with EcoRI, gel purified as describedabove, and ligated to the LITMUS 28i vector (New EnglandBiolabs, Ipswich, MA). Transformed colonies were verified bycolony PCR using the PF15 FRAG primers. The HA tag wasligated separately into pPF15-N plasmids. Positive colonies wereassayed for number of tags and orientation by PCR and digestion.Multiple tagged PF15 genes were transformed into the pf15mutant strain by electroporation [44,45] and transformants werescreened by their ability to oppose gravity.Preparation of Cells for Electron MicroscopyCells were prepared for electron microscopy using methodsdescribed in O\u2019Toole et al. [46,47]. Briefly, aliquots of cells grownin suspension were spun at 5006g and then resuspended in150 mM mannitol. The samples were spun again at 5006g andthe resulting loose cell pellet was then transferred to aluminumsample holders and rapidly frozen in a Balzers HPM010 highpressure freezer (BAL-TEC, Technotrade International, Manche-ster, NH). The frozen cells were freeze-substituted for three days at290uC in 1% OsO4 and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone, warmedto room temperature and embedded in epon/araldite resin.Serial thin (50\u201370 nm) or thick (250\u2013400 nm) sections were cutusing an Ultracut-E microtome (Leica, Germany) and the sectionribbons were collected onto Formvar-coated copper slot grids.

The specimens were placed in a tilt-rotate specimenholder (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) and tomographic data setsrecorded using a TECNAI F30 intermediate-voltage electronmicroscope (FEI, The Netherlands) operated at 300 kV. Imageswere captured every 1u over a 660u range using a Gatan2 K62 K CCD camera at a pixel size of 1 nm. The grid wasrotated 90u, and a second tilt series was acquired. Dual-axistomographic reconstruction was carried out using the IMODsoftware package as previously described [46,49,50]. Briefly, thetilted views were aligned using the positions of the colloidal goldparticles, and tomograms were calculated using an R-weightedback projection algorithm. The two tomograms were then alignedto each other and combined. Finally, dual-axis tomograms fromserial sections were aligned and combined using the methodsdescribed by O\u2019Toole et al. [46]. A total of 7 dual-axis tomogramswere reconstructed to examine the 3-D fine structure of the bld2-5basal bodies.Indirect ImmunofluorescenceInterphase cells were treated with autolysin to remove cell walls[51,52] and resuspended in MT buffer [53] and 12% hexyleneglycol [32] and applied to slides pretreated with poly-L-lysine(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at RT and dried. Slides were incubatedin methanol prechilled to 220uC for 10 min. Slides wererehydrated in 16 PBS and incubated in blocking solution(12.5% BSA, 0.01% cold water fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)) in16 PBS for 30 min. Slides were transferred to blocking solutionwith 10% newborn goat serum (Accurate Chemical, Westbury,NY) and incubated for 30 min at RT without agitation. Primaryantibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubatedovernight at 4uC with the following dilutions; anti-acetylated a-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-centrin (1:1000; kindlyprovided by Dr. Jeff Salisbury, Mayo Clinic), anti-HA (500 ng/ml; Roche, Indianapolis, In), anti-IFT74 (1:600; kindly provided byDr. Carlo Iomini), and anti-c-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich).Slides were washed in 10% blocking solution three times withagitation, 10 min each, at RT and incubated in secondaryantibody for 1 hr at RT. Alexa 594 and Alexa 488 mouse andrabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) were used at 1:1000dilution in blocking solution. Slides were washed three times withagitation, 10 min each, at RT and mounted with Vectashield(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were collected onan Axiophot microscope modified with a Lambda DG-4 lightsource (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) equipped with aPhotometrics Cascade 512B camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson,AZ) and a Physick Instrument piezoelectric stage (Karlsruhe,Germany). Slidebook Digital Software was used for deconvolutionof the images (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) on aDell dual processor computer (Round Rock, TX). Images wereexported to Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, MountainView, CA).Images with synchronized cells were obtained with a PerkinEl-mer UltraVIEW VoX laser scanning disk confocal systemequipped with a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope, a-Plan-Apochromat 1006/1.46 oil DIC M27 objective, and EMCCDcamera. Images were acquired with Volocity software and aredisplayed as maximum projections assembled from a z-stack.Pictures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator.ImmunoblottingProtein extracts from intact cells were prepared from equalnumbers of cells of each strain and mixed with Laemmli samplebuffer (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. TheFigure 4. The bld2-5 and bld2-6 strains misplace the cleavage furrow. A. The ratio of the areas of wild-type sister cells is approximately equalto one (black bars), whereas the ratio of the areas of bld2-5 (gray bars) and bld2-6 (white bars) sister cells is equal to or greater than one, whichsuggests a defect in proper placement of the cleavage furrow [34]. These results are statistically significant compared by a permutation test [37].doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053940.g004Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin FunctionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min to pelletcell debris before loading supernatant onto the gel. Proteins fromintact cells were size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE minigels(1.0 mM thick, 10% acrylamide; 29:1 with Bis-acrylamide) andtransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore; Billerica, MA)in 20% methanol at 50 V for 1 hour. The rat anti-HA high-affinityantibody (200 ng/ml) and chicken anti-PbsA (1:10,000, Agrisera;Sweden) were diluted in 5% milk in PBS. Secondary antibodies,donkey anti-rat HRP (1:10,000, Jackson Labs) and rabbit anti-chicken IgY, HRP (1;10,000, Promega) were diluted in 5% milk inPBS. Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche) was used fordetection and exposure to Super RX x-ray film (Fujifilm,Stamford, CT).

Wild-type cells arrest asswollen cells on 18 mM Taxol medium, while pf15-1 and pf19-1mutant cells become swollen and do not divide on 8 to 18 mMTaxol media (Figure 1C, G). We screened other mutants withdefects in axonemal substructures needed for motility (pf2, pf9,pf14, pf16, pf17, pf18, oda2, ida3) [55,57,58]and only the twokatanin mutants confer Taxol supersensitivity.We next examined the role of basal bodies in this phenotype.The bld2-1 [34], uni3-1 [22], bld10-1 [23], bld12-1 [25], vfl1 [30],vfl2-1 [31], and vfl3 [29] mutations confer Taxol supersensitivity(Figure 1A, B), while the uni1-2 [26] and the uni2-2 [27] mutantsdo not confer supersensitivity. Since a majority of these strainshave a high proportion of aflagellate cells, we asked if the Taxolphenotype was related to the aflagellate phenotype or the basalbody phenotype. Mutants that lack flagella due to defects in IFTproteins and motors (bld1, ift80 at 21uC and fla8, fla10, fla11, fla15,fla17 at 32uC) [20,59\u201365] do not show Taxol supersensitivity(Figure 1A, B). To ask if the Taxol supersensitivity reflects ageneral defect in drug uptake or export, we examined the bld2-1and pf15-1 strains for resistance or sensitivity to other inhibitors(see Materials and Methods for a list). No resistance orsupersensitivity was observed, which suggests that the Taxolsupersensitivity of the bld2 and pf15 alleles does not result fromdefective import or export. In summary, multiple basal bodymutants and the katanin mutants confer Taxol sensitivity. Thewild-type strains show similar swelling but require increasedconcentrations of Taxol (Figure 1 C\u2013J).It is likely that multiple proteins may require intact basal bodiesfor localization and some of these may influence microtubuledynamics. Thus, the Taxol phenotype of the basal body mutantscould arise from a failure to recruit katanin or a failure to recruitkatanin and other proteins. This can be tested in double mutantsof null mutants of katanin and basal body proteins. Therefore, wesought to identify null alleles of pf15 and bld2.Isolation of pf15-3 as a Taxol Supersensitive MutantWild-type cells were mutagenized with ultraviolet light and 100independent, nonmotile strains were isolated and 12 of theseconfer Taxol supersensitivity. One of these strains had immotileflagella. Three lines of evidence show that it carries a new pf15allele. The strain was mapped and is tightly linked to the PF15locus in 36 tetrads. The gene was sequenced and a C to T changewas observed that generates a nonsense codon at amino acid Q59.The immotile cilia defect and the Taxol supersensitivity is rescuedby the PF15::HA transgene (described below) in 17 independenttransformants. The rescued strains have flagella with normallength and motility. The new allele is likely to be a null allele andthe phenotype of the new pf15-3 strain has similar phenotypes tothe original pf15-1 allele, although the presence of central pairmicrotubules has not been determined in the pf15-3 mutant.Isolation of a Taxol Supersensitive bld2-6 AlleleA collection of 3000 mutant strains made by insertionalmutagenesis with the ble gene, which confers Zeocin resistance,[40] was screened for the failure to form colonies on 8 mM Taxolmedium. Thirty-five strains showed Taxol supersensitivity andwere crossed with a wild-type strain (CC-124) to determine if theinsertional ble marker cosegregates with the Taxol phenotype.Cosegregation of Zeocin resistance and Taxol supersensitivity wasobserved in only one strain (strain ble12), which suggests that theselection on Zeocin medium was highly mutagenic as this highfrequency of a lack of cosegregation is not observed in otherinsertional collections. In the ble12 strain, the Taxol phenotype(Figure 1A, B) and resistance to Zeocin cosegregates in 370 tetrads.This strain has a third phenotype; it completely lacks flagella(Table 1) and this phenotype cosegregates as well. The threephenotypes map to linkage group III near the NIT2 locus based oncrosses to CC-1952. The ble12 strain fails to complement the bld2-2 and bld2-5 mutations (see below) for the Taxol and flagellarphenotypes in 8 independent diploid strains for each allele. It alsofails to complement the bld2-2 mutation for the meiotic phenotype;no viable progeny were recovered from 104 tetrads of this cross.PCR with 21 primer pairs in this region revealed that ble12 carriesa 12.6 kb deletion that removes the e-tubulin gene and the codingregion of the PRMT1 gene, which encodes a protein methyltrans-ferase protein (Table S2). The ble12 mutant allele is named bld2-6.bld2; pf15 Double Mutants have an Additive PhenotypeThe Taxol phenotype of the bld2 alleles and the pf15 strains issimilar and both are unable to grow on 8 mM Taxol containingmedium. Double mutants were constructed to ask if the phenotypeof double mutants is more severe than either mutant alone. If thereare other proteins that must be recruited, then an additive orsynthetic phenotype should be observed using the two null alleles.Wild-type, pf15-3, bld2-6, pf15-3; bld2-6, bld2-6; pf15-1, and bld2-6;pf15-3 were grown on 0, 4, 6, 10 mM Taxol containing medium.All strains grow on 4 mM and only the bld2-6, pf15-1 and the bld2-6; pf15-3 double mutant strains fail to grow on 6 mM Taxolcontaining medium while the single mutant strains form colonieson this concentration (Figure 1K). This additive phenotypesuggests that the recruitment of other proteins besides kataninp80 may affect microtubule dynamics. This is not surprising inthat over 100 proteins have postulated to reside at the centrosome[66].Characterization of the bld2-4 alleleWe had previously reported that e-tubulin is an essential genebased on the bld2-4 allele [34]. The bld2-4 allele is an insertionalFigure 6. Katanin p80 is absent or diffusely localized in the bld2 mutant strains.

(I\u2013L) in the bld2-5 strain hasheterogeneous katanin p80 staining that is correlated with the centrin localization pattern. Katanin p80 localization appears wild-type in bld2-7 (M, N)and bld2-9 (O, P) pseudorevertants. bld10 cells do not localize katanin p80 (Q, R), while uni3 cells show variable staining (S\u2013V).

Katanin p80 localizes to the spindle poles during mitosis where the spindle microtubules (red) are stained withan antibody against a-tubulin and DNA (blue) is stained with DAPI (Y\u2013A\u2019).

Geneticanalysis showed that the bld2-4 allele could only be recovered in adisomic background, which suggested that e-tubulin was anessential gene in Chlamydomonas. The isolation of the bld2-6 broughtinto question if e-tubulin is an essential gene. To ask if the BLD2transgene is sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype [34], we usedthe disomic bld2-1; bld2-4 in a series of crosses (Figure S2). Wefound that two copies of the BLD2 gene are necessary to rescue themeiotic lethal phenotype and that the BLD2 transgene fails torescue the mitotic lethality. To ask if the insertion is associatedwith a deletion and to determine the extent of the deletion,progeny obtained from a cross with the polymorphic strain, CC-1952, were used. Progeny were scored by the presence of the NIT2allele from the CC-1952 parent, the absence of the bld2-1 allele,the presence of the BLD2 transgene. The extent of the deletion wasestimated by the presence/absence of heterozygosity of physicalmarkers surrounding the BLD2 gene (Table S1). The deletionextends from position 4125635 on chromosome 3 to between4026909 and 4021900, which removes 28 predicted genes. Thedominant meiotic lethality is likely to be due to the loss of multiplegenes given that the transgene rescues the meiotic phenotype ofbld2-6 (see below). Rescue of the mitotic lethality of bld2-4 is likelyto require additional flanking DNA and thus e-tubulin is not anessential gene as reported previously [34].Isolation and Identification of the bld2-5 AlleleConcurrently, we identified an additional bld2 allele using anoncomplementation screen. A screen of phenotypically wild-typeheterozygous BLD2/bld2 diploid strains produced six strains thatfailed to swim. Non-complementation screens produce severaloutcomes in addition to new alleles, which include mitoticrecombination, chromosome loss and unlinked dominant enhanc-ers [34]. Two of the mutant strains resulted from mitoticrecombination or chromosome loss based on the loss of the FokIrestriction site (see Material and Methods). The remaining fourstrains remained heterozygous at the BLD2 locus and were matedto a bld2 strain to determine if the new mutations were new allelesor unlinked dominant enhancers. Two of the mutants producedswimming progeny that suggest an unlinked dominant enhancer.The other two strains did not produce swimming progeny, whichsuggests new alleles. One of these strains (4-1) was characterized.The 4-1 mutant strain was backcrossed twice to wild-type cellsto remove unlinked mutations and to restore euploidy as judged bygreater than 86% meiotic viability. The backcrossed 4-1 strainfailed to oppose to gravity and lacked flagella and the aflagellatephenotype was used for mapping. The mutation failed torecombine with the bld2-1 allele in 210 complete tetrads. Weanalyzed 1571 progeny from the cross of 4-1 to the polymorphicstrain, CC-1952 [67] using dCAPs markers (Table S2). The 4-1mutation maps to a 54.1 kb region that includes the BLD2 gene[68] and gives a value of 102 kb per map unit for this region.We sequenced e-tubulin from the 4-1 strain and found a T to Atransition that changes an isoleucine to an asparagine at aminoacid 163 (I163N). Introduction of a wild-type copy of BLD2 into the4-1 strain through a cross with a bld2-1 strain with an unlinkedFigure 7.

The FokI restrictionenzyme digest assay (see Materials and Methods) differentiatesbetween swimming progeny with the BLD2 transgene and thebld2-1 allele (heterozygous) or the 4-1 allele (homozygous).Approximately one-half of the swimming progeny show thehomozygous digestion pattern predicted for the 4-1 strain and theremainder shows the heterozygous pattern of wild-type and bld2-1(n = 6; data not shown). Thus, the transgene rescues the flagellarphenotype of the 4-1 allele to the same extent as it rescues the bld2-1 allele (see Table 1). Unlike the other bld2 alleles, the 4-1 alleledoes not display a meiotic phenotype in four homoallelic or 16heteroallelic meiotic crosses of independent meiotic progeny.The isoleucine is not highly conserved in e-tubulin from adiverse range of organisms (7 of 28), therefore we screened forreversion of the aflagellate phenotype to provide further evidencethat this change was responsible for the phenotypes. Cells weremutagenized with ultraviolet light and 25 independent strains thatswim were isolated. In crosses of these swimming strains to wild-type cells, the aflagellate phenotype was not recovered in 8 of the25 strains in at least 10 tetrads; these are likely to be intragenicrevertants or tightly linked suppressors. The other 17 strainssegregated the aflagellate phenotype, which indicates that theycontain extragenic suppressor mutations. The characterization ofthese extragenic suppressors will be reported elsewhere. Todetermine if the mutation in the 4-1 strain is changed in therevertants, a 367 bp fragment containing the I163N mutation wassequenced. Four of the strains convert the asparagine back toisoleucine; these are true revertants. The remaining four strainsare pseudorevertants. Two strains (T42 and T16) change theasparagine to serine (N163S) and the other two strains (T33 andT29) convert the serine at position 144 to a glycine (S144G, I163N),but retain the asparagine. The amino acids from e-tubulin arecompared to the corresponding amino acids of the b-tubulincrystal structure using Modeller [69]. The isoleucine of e-tubulinlies in a hydrophobic region and the S144 lies in loop between a b-strand (B4) and a a-helix (H3), which is a part of the nucleotidebinding region [70]. The change of a hydrophobic isoleucine to ahydrophilic asparagine should greatly change the properties of thisregion. In the T42 and T16 strains, asparagine is mutated to thesmaller and more neutral amino acid serine. The identification ofa mutation in the coding region of e-tubulin, the rescue of thephenotype with a wild-type e-tubulin transgene and the identifi-cation of both true and pseudorevertants suggest that the 4-1 strainis a new e-tubulin allele that we call bld2-5. Furthermore, thepseudorevertants identify new bld2 alleles: the T42 and T16pseudorevertants are named bld2-7 and bld2-8 and the T33 andT29 pseudorevertants are named bld2-9 and bld2-10. The bld2-5strain with an extra copy of BLD2 (e-tubulin) as well the bld2-7 andbld2-9 intragenic revertants do not show the Taxol supersensitivityphenotype (Figure 1A, B).Phenotypic Analysis of the bld2-5 and PseudorevertantStrainsThe bld2-5 strain exhibits a less severe flagellar assembly defectthan observed in previously described bld2 alleles. Ninety-fivepercent of the bld2-5 cells are aflagellate, but 4% of the cells haveone flagellum and 1% has two flagella in logarithmically growncells (n = 200) (Table 1). Surprisingly, when bld2-5 cells aredeprived of nitrogen and arrested in G1 of the cell cycle as gameticcells, 20.5% of the cells assemble at least one flagellum. Changingthe cell cycle time by growing cells at 14uC or 32uC does notchange the number of flagellated cells (Table 1), which suggests thebld2-5 allele is not temperature-sensitive, but may be modulated bynutritional cues. This is the only bld2 allele that shows thisphenotype.In wild-type strains, centrin is a component of the distal striatedfiber that connects the distal ends of the basal bodies, the stellatefibers of the transition zone, and extends as fibers from the basalbody to the nucleus (the nucleo-basal body connector) [71](Figure 2A, B). In bld2-1 strains, centrin collapses on or around thenucleus [34,72]. Collapsed centrin occurs in 41% of bld2-5 cells(n = 50, Figure 2C) while the remainder has a wild-typelocalization pattern (Figure 2D). It appears that the presence ofan extended nucleo-basal body connector does not guaranteeflagellar assembly.In wild-type strains, acetylated a-tubulin labeling of rootletmicrotubules forms a cruicate pattern [32,73] Figure 3A, B). Thebld2-5 strain, like other bld2 strains, shows disorganized rootletmicrotubules in 95% of the cells (Figure 3C, D). The 5% of cellswith wild-type rootlet microtubules are likely to have intactmicrotubule blades at the proximal end of the basal bodies [74].Proper placement of the cleavage furrow depends on both centrinand rootlet microtubules [75]. Defects in these cytoskeletalstructures cause aberrant cleavage furrow placement [76]. Thearea of newly divided daughter cells was measured to determine ifthe cleavage furrows were properly placed, since wild-type cellsproduce daughters with equal sizes [34]. Based on measurementsof 100 pairs of cells, the bld2-5 strain produces daughters withsignificantly different areas (p = 0.001), which indicates a defect incleavage furrow placement (Figure 4A). The sum of bld2-5 sistercells\u2019 areas is significantly smaller than wild-type (p = 5610214,Figure 4B), which may suggest that the cells divide earlier than inwild-type cells. Both rescued transformants (bld2-5; BLD2TG) andintragenic revertants (bld2-7 and bld2-9) assemble comparablenumbers of flagella as wild-type cells (Table 1). They display wild-type centrin localization (Figure 2E\u2013J). The transgene containingstrain has wild-type rootlet microtubules (Figure 3E\u2013J), butapproximately 50% of rootlet microtubule bundles (n = 15) inthe intragenic revertants appear to be slightly splayed at their ends(Figure 3H).The bld2-6 allele also shows centrin collapsed on the nucleus(Figure 2K, L) and disorganized rootlet microtubules (Figure 3M,N). bld2-6 cells are 100% aflagellate as vegetative or gametic cells(Table 1). A single copy of the e-tubulin gene rescues the flagellar,Taxol, and meiotic defects as well as centrin localization (n = 20)and the rootlet microtubules phenotypes of the bld2-6 allele (n = 15).bld2-5 Cells have Staggered Microtubule Blades Lengthsin Mature Basal BodiesEach mature basal body is associated with a probasal body thatwill elongate during the next mitotic cycle [77,78]. In wild-typeFigure 8. IFT74 localization is aberrant in the bld2 alleles. (A\u2013C) IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize. (D\u2013F) IFT74 (green) localizes to thebase of the flagella in wild-type cell as a band as well as to the proximal region of the flagella and partially colocalizes with centrin (red) in the striatedfiber at the distal end of the basal body but not along the nucleo basal body connectors at the proximal end (red). (G\u2013I) bld2-5 cells show staining atthe base of the flagella, however the localization appears reduced compared to wild-type cells. (J\u2013L) IFT74 localizes throughout the cytoplasm in bld2-6 cells. In about one-half of the cells examined, IFT74 localizes near the aberrant centrin staining at the nucleus. DNA (blue) is stained with DAPI. Scalebar in Panel A equals 5 mm. Panels A\u2013L are at the same magnification.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053940.g008Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin FunctionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940cells, the probasal bodies are roughly 80 nm in length and consistof a proximal ring of amorphous material, a nine-spoked cartwheeland nine triplet microtubule blades [79]. In bld2-5 cells, theproximal ends of the probasal bodies maintain a ring ofamorphous material and a cartwheel, however microtubule bladesmay be incomplete (Figure 5; Movie S1). Unlike the probasalbodies, the amorphous material in the mature bld2-5 basal body isnot present as a thin ring rather it can extend to over 200 nm,which is variable from cell to cell. Most tomographic reconstruc-tions have both amorphous material and microtubule blades(Figure 5A\u2013E; arrowheads; Figure S3; arrowheads). The assemblyof microtubule blades is also incomplete with singlet, doublet andsometimes triplet microtubules present as one moves from theproximal base of the basal body to the distal end (Figure 5; right;Figure S3). Incomplete basal bodies were also observed with only 7or 8 blades are present at the distal tip (Figure S3A). In some cellsthe cartwheel structure assembles farther from the proximal basethan in wild-type basal bodies (Figure 5 C, D; arrow; Figure S3C;arrow). Basal bodies competent to template flagella assembleectopic transition zone material in the basal body proper (FigureS3B, D; arrow), which resembles the ectopic transition zonepresent in the uni3-1 strain [47]. Probasal bodies in the bld2-5strain assemble with minor defects; however, as the basal bodymatures, it loses its integrity, which indicates that Bld2p is neededto maintain basal body structure. The collapsed centrin fibers andaberrant rootlet microtubules observed by immunofluorescenceare confirmed by the tomography in which the fibers aremisplaced in many of the cells.Taxol Supersensitive Strains Recover from TaxolTreatmentMutant and wild-type cells were treated with 8 mM Taxol for 48hours, washed twice in rich medium and stained with Trypan blueto determine the number of dead cells in each replicate sample(n = 3). There was no significant difference between the averagenumber of live cells in treated and untreated cultures of bld2-5,bld2-6, tub2-1, pf15-1 and pf15-3 strains (Table 2). These datasuggest that the Taxol supersensitivity of these mutants does notarise from a basal body integrity checkpoint but rather from anarrest.Katanin is Mislocalized in the bld2 MutantsKatanin influences microtubule dynamics by severing microtu-bules. The PF15 gene encodes p80 katanin [56] and pf15 strainsshow Taxol supersensitive (Figure 1A, B). We constructed a PF15-HA epitope tagged vector that places the HA tag at the terminalamino acid, which was changed from a leucine to an asparagine,transformed the plasmid into the pf15-1 strain, and screened forrescue of the paralyzed flagellar phenotype. Twenty-one indepen-dent swimming strains were isolated and each transgenic strainalso rescues the Taxol supersensitive phenotype. Immunoblotswere used to determine which transgenic lines have the highestlevel of PF15-HA protein. Seven of the twenty-0ne strains showeda band detected by antibodies to HA antibody with the correctmolecular weight (,100 kDa). Based on immunoblot andimmunofluorescence data, one of the lines was used for furtheranalysis (Figure 6).By immunofluorescence, katanin localizes as two dots ininterphase (n = 57, (Figure 6A\u2013D) and to the spindle poles duringmitosis (n = 4, Figure 6Y\u2013A\u2019; Figure 7) in wild-type cells. Sixty-sixpercent of bld2-6 cells (n = 70) lack katanin p80 staining and theremainder have diffuse, lower intensity staining (Figure 6E\u2013H).The bld2-5 cells (n = 30) show two centrin localization patterns(Figure 2C, D), which are correlated to the katanin localizationpattern. Of the cells with collapsed centrin, the majority (n = 12/14) has no katanin p80 localization while the remaining two havediffuse katanin p80 at the basal bodies (Figure 6I, J). Of the cellswith wild-type centrin fibers (n = 16), 4 lack katanin p80 stainingand 8 show diffuse katanin p80 localization (Figure 6K, L). Theremaining 4 cells show wild-type katanin p80 localization.Intragenic revertants display wild-type katanin p80 localization(n = 40) (Figure 6P\u2013S). Immunoblots show that the amount ofkatanin p80 protein in the bld2 cells is similar to the expression inwild-type cells. Therefore, the lack of localization is not due to adecrease in katanin p80 expression (Figure 6B\u2019). Intact basal bodiesappear to be important for katanin p80 localization.Katanin Localization Requires Triplet Microtubules, butnot the Transition ZoneTo further determine which structures in the basal bodyapparatus are needed for katanin p80 localization, we examinedp80 localization in uni1-2 cells, which lack a transition zone on thedaughter basal body [26] in uni3-1 cells, which assemble doubletbut not triplet microtubules [22,80]; and in bld10 cells, which lackany microtubule blades [23]. Katanin p80 localization in uni1-2cells appears as two dots (n = 6), which suggests it does not requirethe transition zone for proper localization (Figure 6Q, R). In bld10-1 cells, there is no localization of katanin p80 (n = 30), whichfurther supports the need for the basal body for localization ofkatanin. Localization of katanin p80 in the uni3 cells shows avariety of phenotypes that include the complete absence (40/50),diffuse staining (5/50) or increased signal (5/50) (Figure 6S\u2013V).Because uni3-1 cells lack triplet microtubule blades except at thedistal tip of the basal body [22], it seems likely that tripletmicrotubules are important for katanin p80 localization but arenot sufficient.IFT52 localizes to transition fibers and localizes aberrantly inthe bld2-1 allele [20], we examined localization of anothercomponent of the IFT B complex, IFT74. As shown previously[61], IFT74 localizes to the flagellar base as a punctate dot and inthe proximal region of the flagella in wild-type cells (Figure 8D\u2013F).IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize in wild-type cells(Figure 8A\u2013C). This result supports the uni1-2 result that kataninp80 is not present on the transition fibers.Like the katanin p80 localization, the IFT74 pattern in bld2-5 ismore diffuse than in wild-type cells (n = 40, Figure 8G\u2013I). In bld2-6cells, there is increased staining throughout the cytoplasm of allcells with dots that are not at the basal body region (n = 40)(Figure 8J\u2013L). Sixteen cells show IFT74 localization near the basalbodies. The increased cytoplasmic staining in bld2-6 cells mayreflect an increased level of IFT74 in the cytoplasm that wouldnormally be present in the flagella.DiscussionLoss of Basal Body Integrity Perturbs Katanin LocalizationThe pf15 and pf19 alleles are unique among the flagellar motilitymutants tested in Chlamydomonas; they confer supersensitivity toTaxol (Figure 1). The mutants with basal body integrity defects(bld2, bld10, bld12, uni3) or basal body fiber defects (vfl1, vfl2, vfl3)also confer Taxol supersensitivity and suggest a simple hypothesisthat we tested. These organelles help to recruit proteins for spindleassembly and function. Specifically, we showed that a loss of basalbody integrity results in a failure to recruit and localize kataninand this failure mimics the loss of function phenotype of the pf15and pf19 strains. Acetylation, a post-translational modification ofK40 in a-tubulin, is associated with more stable microtubules [81],and the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype of a b-tubulin mutant [2]Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin FunctionPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940or in the katanin mutants in Tetrahymena [7] is associated withincreased levels of acetylated a-tubulin. The bld2 alleles do nothave increased acetylation of interphase microtubules (Figure 3).We identified viable null alleles in the PF15 and BLD2 genes,which suggest that these two genes are not essential inChlamydomonas. The bld2-6; pf15 double mutant confers a moresevere defect than in either single mutant on Taxol medium. Thismore severe phenotype indicates that recruitment of additionalproteins at basal bodies affects microtubule dynamics. None of themutants block spindle function in mitosis in the absence of Taxol.Given that the bld2-1 and bld2-6 alleles have a recessive meioticdefect, there may be a stronger requirement for the recruitment ofproteins to the meiotic spindle than to the mitotic spindle inChlamydomonas. Although mutants with basal body integrity defectscan still build spindles and progress through the cell cycle,microtubules in these cells may be inherently unstable as judged byTaxol sensitivity.Electron tomography of the bld2-5 allele suggests that e-tubulinis necessary for basal body assembly/elongation. This staggeredphenotype of bld2-5 is also observed in the bld2-1; rgn1-1 strain,where rgn1-1 is a partial suppressor of the bld2-1 allele [34], and itis similar to the knockdown phenotype observed in Paramecium[82]. Since the probasal body structure is not affected to a largedegree, this allele suggests that this mutant e-tubulin is able toparticipate in the initiation events needed to build the probasalbody, but not in the elongation of the probasal body to thedaughter basal body. Based on tomographic reconstruction ofduplicating basal bodies, these two events are separated in time.The existing probasal body elongates to become the daughterbasal body at prophase and the new probasal body forms inmetaphase (O\u2019Toole and Dutcher, in preparation).Rasi and colleagues reported that katanin p60 is an essentialgene, is required for release of the basal bodies from the flagellausing an RNA interference strategy to the p60 gene, and thatkatanin localizes to the basal bodies [83]. However, Dymek andSmith suggest that katanin p60 is encoded by the PF19 gene [84].Based on two pf19 alleles, this gene does not play a role in releaseof flagella, and the anti-p60 serum reported by Rasi does notrecognize the tagged p60-GFP protein in whole cell extracts [84],which makes our tagged gene the only means to examinelocalization of the katanin heterodimer. Our phenotypes for pf15and pf19 are similar and suggest that katanin p60 and p80 behavesimilarly in Chlamydomonas as in other organisms.Localization of Katanin Requires Intact Basal BodiesThe transition fibers are required for IFT localization, andsubdistal appendages are required for PCM localization in animalcells, several of our observations were unexpected. In uni1-2 cells,which lack the transition zone and transition fibers on the youngerof the two basal bodies, two dots of katanin are observed ratherthan one. Additionally, IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize.Thus, we suggest that the transition fibers are not required forkatanin p80 localization and that the requirements at the basalbodies for IFT and katanin p80 recruitment and localization aredifferent.We suggest that the recruitment requires triplet microtubules asthe uni3 mutant shows defects in p80 localization but has normaltransition fibers. The uni3 mutant fails to assemble tripletmicrotubules, but 25% of the cells assemble two flagella, 25%assemble one flagellum, and 50% have no flagella. We havehypothesized that the age of the basal bodies influences thisdistribution [22,47]. As the basal bodies age, they may acquireadditional proteins or post-translational modifications that allowsfor recruitment. Thus, the katanin localization phenotype isintriguing in that there are three localization phenotypes in uni3mutants. These may correspond to the age of the older basal body.The triplet microtubules are known to be important for thelocalization of centrin and rootlet microtubules via specificmicrotubule blades [47]. We cannot rule out the model that thetriplet microtubules do not directly recruit p80, but may play anindirect role via intermediary proteins. Basal bodies in C. elegansand Drosophila lack triplet microtubules, but still recruit PCM. LikeChlamydomonas, basal body mutants in these organisms also fail torecruit PCM and suggest the mechanism of PCM recruitment maydepend on the basal body structure of an organism.Other Proteins that Moderate Taxol SensitivityBesides basal body defects, work in other systems has shownmultiple modes to confer Taxol sensitivity. Interestingly, twosmoothened antagonists sensitize cells to Taxol in ovarian cancercell lines [85]. It is interesting to consider that localization of thehedgehog pathway in the cilia could modulate recruitment ofother proteins to the basal bodies. Increased expression of Nek4, aNimA-like kinase is associated with Taxol sensitivity [86]. Itstargets remain unknown. Finally, changes in expression ofSeptin10 and Bub3 alter Taxol sensitivity. Increased Sept10expression is associated with sensitivity while decreased expressionis associated with resistance to Taxol [87,88]. Modifiers thatconfer Taxol sensitivity have been identified in HapMaplymphoblastoid cell lines; the predominant class of genes withvariants encodes solute carriers (SLC) [89]. Resistance to Taxolhas been observed in a large number of clinical samples followingtreatment with this drug. Mutations in over 20 amino acids in b-tubulin have been observed in Taxol resistant cell lines [90]. Theremay be many targets and mechanisms by which Taxol sensitivity ismodulated. Further screens for the Taxol supersensitivity pheno-type may provide a new class of variants that will be useful forcancer therapeutics.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Schematic drawing of the katanin p80epitope-tagged transgene. The last amino acid and the stopcodon were mutated to a NotI restriction site by knitting PCR. The3X hemmaglutinin (HA) tag was introduced into the engineeredsite.(TIF)Figure S2 Rescue of the meiotic phenotype requires twowild-type copies of the BLD2 gene and the BLD2transgene does not rescue the mitotic lethality. Cross Iis a repeat of the results obtained previously [34] showing that thedisomic strain (red and black chromosomes) produces no viableprogeny when crossed by wild-type strain (CC-124, blue) (n = 120tetrads). Cross II involves a wild-type CC-1952 parent (greenchromosome) carrying the BLD2 transgene (purple) that isunlinked to the BLD2 locus. The presence of the transgene issufficient to rescue the meiotic phenotype (75% of the progenyfrom 40 tetrads survive). This result is reinforced by results inCross III that uses progeny from Cross II that lack the bld2-1chromosome, which were eliminated from consideration usingPCR and digestion with FokI (Materials and Methods). This leavessix possible genotypes. No aflagellate progeny were recovered,which strongly suggests that the bld2-4 allele is lethal (indicated by0 under viable progeny for strains iiii and iiiiii). dCAPS markersdescribed in Tables S1 and S2 were used to determined whichstrains carried CC-1952, bld2-4 chromosomes, and the BLD2transgene. Ten strains were used for Cross III.

Three progeny had the bld2-4 chromosome, the CC-1952chromosome, and the transgene and gave 60% viability in 125tetrads, but no aflagellate progeny were recovered, which suggeststhat the bld2-4 allele is lethal. Two progeny had the bld2-4chromosome and the CC-1952 chromosome and gave 24%viability in 100 tetrads.
