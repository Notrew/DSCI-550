"Anti-inflammatory effect of aldose reductase inhibition in murinepolymicrobial sepsisAramati BM Reddy, Satish K Srivastava, and Kota V RamanaDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston,Texas -77555, USAAbstractAim\u2014Increased production of cytokines and chemokines in serum and tissues upon oxidative stresscaused by severe systemic infections are the major cause of sepsis. Aldose reductase (AR) known tomediate oxidative stress- induced NF-\u03baB activation and transcription of cytokines and chemokinesare the main mediator of bacterial endotoxin - and lipopolysaccharide -induced inflammatorycytokines. Our aim is to investigate the effect of AR inhibitors on the prevention of inflammatorycytokines in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis which closelymimics the sepsis syndrome in humans.Results\u2014Mice were rendered septic by CLP in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor, sorbinil.The levels of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory markers in the plasma, peritoneal fluidand heart of mice were significantly inhibited by sorbinil. Inhibition of AR also prevented CLP-induced COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in heart, kidney and spleen.Conclusions\u2014Our results showed that the inhibition of AR significantly prevented thepolymicrobial sepsis-induced increase in inflammatory markers and thus indicate the use of ARinhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.KeywordsSepsis; Cecum Ligation and Puncture; Cytokines; Inflammation; Aldose Reductase1 INTRODUCTIONSepsis is a serious medical condition that results in increased fatalities in elderly,immunocompromised and critically ill intubated patients [1]. This disease is characterized bywhole-body inflammation due to severe systemic infection [2]. Severely burnt patients usuallydevelop sepsis which is the major cause of death if not aggressively and timely treated[3]. Inthe United States alone, sepsis is the second leading cause of death in non-coronary intensivecare unit patients [4], which account for 20 to 50% deaths per year out of 660,000 affectedcases [5]. Despite significant advances in the understanding of pathogenesis of sepsis and itscomplications, barely a small number of restorative strategies have been employed that could\u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although sepsis is generally initiated by abacterial infection, the pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by increased levels ofinflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines that could lead to severecomplications such as multi-organ failure and death [6]. Eventhough the treatment with broadrange antibiotics is generally effective in killing the replicating bacteria, the dead bacterial cellwall components act as bacterial toxins which cause overwhelming systemic inflammatoryresponse [7]. Thus controlling bacterial infection is not sufficient to treat sepsis. It is ratherimportant to neutralize the immunogenic signals that activate transcription factors thattranscribe inflammatory markers. Although several new therapeutic strategies have beendescribed in the literature for the treatment of sepsis to date, various anti-inflammatorystrategies have produced only modest therapeutic effects in critically ill sepsis patients [8].Recently, we have shown that the treatment with AR inhibitors results in profoundly improvedsurvival in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endotoximia in mice[9]. The observedimprovement in survival after treatment with AR inhibitors or AR-siRNA was associated withrestoration of cardiac muscle contractility and cardiac functions. We have demonstrated thata significant increase in the levels of serum as well as heart cytokines, chemokines and otherinflammatory markers such as COX-2, iNOS and PGE2 in LPS-treated mice whichsignificantly contributes to pathophysiology of sepsis, was markedly prevented by ARinhibition [9]. Also inhibition of AR prevented the endotoxin, high glucose and TNF-\u03b1 inducedincrease in the redox sensitive transcription factors, NF-\u03baB and AP-1, which are known totranscribe various inflammatory markers [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. These resultssuggest that AR inhibitors, developed as anti-diabetic drugs, could be used as therapeuticintervention to prevent sepsis [16]. AR inhibitors such as zopolrestat, fidarestat have beenfound to be safe and passed in FDA\u2019s Phase-I and clinical trials for diabetic neuropathy butfailed in Phase-III clinical trials as they have been shown to be not as effective. There areseveral AR inhibitors such as raneristat that are still undergoing phase-III trails for diabeticneuropathy. An AR inhibitor, epalrestat is available in Japan mainly to treat patients withdiabetic neuropathy [16] and [17]. Our recent results demonstrate that AR inhibitors could beused therapeutically for inflammatory disorders other than diabetic complications [15] and[18]. For such use a careful examination of the effect of AR inhibition in clinically relevantanimal models is mandatory. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with ARinhibitors could prevent alterations in the cytokine and chemokine levels in a clinically morerelevant model that mimics sepsis conditions in humans. Our results indicate that AR inhibitoris a powerful repressor of the expression of major cytokines and chemokines in a mouse modelof polymicrobial sepsis indicating its use as potential anti-inflammatory agent in sepsis andassociated complications.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. MaterialsAntibodies against COX-2, iNOS p65-NF-\u03baB and HMGB-1 were purchased from Santa CruzBiotech, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against AR were custom raised and tested forspecificity. Mouse specific ELISA kits for cytokines were purchased from BD biosciences(Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cytokine antibody array was purchased from RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross,GA). Sorbinil was gift from Pfizer (Groton, CT). ACTICHROME\u00ae Tissue factor activity assaykit was purchased from American diagnostic Inc (Stamford, CT), Tramadol Hydrochloridefrom Mallinckrodt Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of the highest purity available.2.2. CLP procedureBALB/c female mice (19-23 g) were obtained from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME)and housed with regular diet and ambience for 48 hrs before recruiting to the study. The animalsReddy et al. Page 2Cytokine. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 December 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptwere maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animalspublished by the National Institutes of Health and in accordance with the Institute\u2019s \u201cGuidelineof the Animal Care and Use Committee\u201d. Using previously described method [19] CLPprocedure was performed by anesthetizing the mice with ketamine (60 \u03bcg/g) and xylazine (10\u03bcg/g) and a 2-cm midline incision was made through the linea alba. The cecum was located,ligated with sterile 3-0 silk, and perforated with double puncture using a 18-gauge needle. Asmall amount of stool was extruded to ensure wound potency. Sham-treated mice also hadsurgery done along with cecal manipulations but without ligation and puncture. The cecumwas then replaced in its original position within the abdomen, and incision was immediatelyclosed. Soon after surgery, each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of 1 ml of warm (37\u00b0C) normal saline with traMADOL hydrochloride (20 \u03bcg/g body wt). To inhibit AR, micereceived 25 mg/kg body wt sorbinil 2 h after surgery and then 6 h after surgery. All mice (5 ineach group) were kept at 22\u00b0C and killed after 14 h of surgery. Blood was collected from theheart in EDTA-coated tubes. Plasma was separated from cellular components by centrifugationat 600x g for 5 min and stored at -20\u00b0C. For peritoneal lavage, 2 cm skin was removed leavingthe peritoneal membrane intact. Then 1 ml of ice-cold 1\u00d7 Hanks balanced salt solution (withoutCaCl2, MgCl2, Mg2SO4, or phenol red; GIBCO) was injected using 26 gauge needle. Afterinjection, peritoneum was gently palpated for 30 s, and peritoneal fluid was aspirated out usinga 20 gauge needle. The fluid was centrifuged (600 \u00d7 g, 5 min), and the supernatant was storedat -20\u00b0C. Heart and aorta tissues were collected and stored at -70\u00b0C for tissue homogenates.2.3. Measurement of Cytokines in plasmaMice after 14 h of surgery were euthanized and blood was collected in to EDTA-coatedvacutainers by heart puncture. plasma was separated by centrifugation at 600 g for 5 min.Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 in the plasma were measured by using respectivemouse specific ELISA kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Known concentrationsof standards were used to generate the standard curves. The reaction was initiated by theaddition of 0.1 ml of the serum, stopped and read at 450 nm on an ELISA plate reader. Theresults obtained are expressed as pg/ml of the plasma.2.4. Measurement of cytokines and chemokines in heartTo measure the expression of cytokines and chemokines in heart tissue homogenates, we usedcommercially available RayBio Mouse cytokine antibody array system that determines theexpression of 64 inflammatory markers from a single sample by following manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. In brief, 100 \u03bcg heart tissue homogenates were incubated with array supportmembrane where the membrane was specifically coated with antigens to capture an array ofcytokines. The tagged proteins were detected by conjugating with biotinylated antobodies andstreptavidin system. Fold change was calculated from the measured intensities of the individualspots signal developed on X-ray film using Kodak-densitometry software.2.5. Western blot analysisTo examine the effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced expression of COX-2, iNOS, AR, NF-\u03baB and HMGB-1 we homogenized heart, spleen and kidney tissues obtained from euthanizedmice after 14 h of CLP procedure. Equal amount of protein from homogenates were subjectedto SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and membranes were probed for against specificantibodies AR, iNOS, pP65-NF\u03baB, COX-2, HMG-1 (HMGB1) and GAPDH. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).All blots were probed with GAPDH as a loading control and densitometric analysis was carriedout by using Kodak Image station.Reddy et al.

Tissue Factor AssayTissue factor was measured in mice plasma by using ACTICHROME\u00ae Tissue factor activityassay kit from American diagnostic Inc by following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In-brief Afterthe experimental procedure mice plasma were collected as described in methods and thereaction was initiated by adding equal amount of plasma to reaction mixture containinglapidated tissue factor, factor VIII and factor X, allowing to form complex with fVIIa togenerate TF/fVIIa complexes and convert fX into fXa. fXa cleaves the chromogenic substrateand the formation of color is measured by reading absorbance at 409 nm using micro well platereader. Amount of tissue factor in the sample were calculated using the standards. The resultsobtained were measured in pMoles.2.7. Statistical analysisData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and the p values were determined using the one-wayANOVA and unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.3 RESULTS3.1. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in plasma and peritoneal cytokines by AR inhibitionTo investigate the effect of AR inhibition on polymicrobial infection -induced inflammatoryresponse, we performed CLP-surgery on mice injected without or with AR inhibitor, sorbinil.Increased redness around the cecum caused by increased blood flow due to dilatory expansionof microcirculatory blood vessels observed in the CLP operated mice was prevented by ARinhibitor (Fig. 1). The plasma and peritoneal fluids were collected 14 h after CLP procedureand analyzed for cytokines and chemokines. The plasma and peritoneal fluid levels of IL-1\u03b2,IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 proteins in sham-operated controls were low but detectable (Fig. 1A-D, left panel). However in the CLP mice the plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1increased by approximately \u223c0.8, 37, 11 and 10 folds, respectively (Fig. 1A-D, left panel). Onthe other hand, administration of sorbinil to the CLP mice significantly (\u223c45-80%) preventedthe increase in the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Similarly, in CLP mice theperitoneal fluid levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 increased by 5.2, 31, 10 and 5 folds,respectively (Fig. 2A-D, right panel) and administration of sorbinil to the CLP micesignificantly (\u223c40-70%) prevented the increase in cytokine levels. AR inhibitors alone had noeffect on the basal levels of these cytokines and chemokines in plasma or peritoneal fluid.Further, the measurement of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6) in the serumat 3 h after CLP surgery did not cause any increase in the cytokine levels as compared to controlsand ARI treated mice (data not shown). These results suggest that AR inhibition could preventpolymicrobial infection-induced systemic production of inflammatory cytokines andchemokines in mice.3.2. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in tissue cytokines by AR inhibitionSince increased cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyopathy due to augmented local productionof inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are the major cause of mortality and morbidityobserved in patients with sepsis [20], we specifically examined the effect of AR inhibition onCLP-induced cytokines and chemokines in the mice hearts. We used an antibody array thatdetermines the expression of 64 cytokines and chemokines and other inflammatory markersfrom a single sample (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of MIP-2, MIP-1 and lymphotoxinincreased by \u223c6 fold in CLP mice group whereas the increase was only \u223c3 fold in case of CLP+ sorbinil group. Similarly the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were significantlyelevated in CLP group of mice and administration of AR inhibitor significantly prevented thesecytokines and chemokines (Fig. 3B).Reddy et al. Page 4Cytokine. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 December 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptWe next determined the effect of AR inhibition on the CLP-induced levels of inflammatorymarkers COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in heart, spleen and kidney homogenates by Westernblot analysis (Fig.4). As shown in Fig. 4A and B, polymicrobial sepsis caused \u223c3.5, \u223c2.5 foldinduction of COX-2 and iNOS respectively which was significantly (\u223c90%) prevented by theadministration of AR inhibitor. Similarly in CLP mice tissue homogenates, a significantincrease in AR protein was observed and inhibitors of AR prevented CLP-induced increase inthe expression of AR protein (Fig. 4C). Since the expression of cytokines and chemokines,COX-2, iNOS and AR depends on the activation of NF-\u03baB, we next measured the activatedform of NF-\u03baB in mice heart, spleen and kidney homogenates. As shown in Fig. 4D the CLP-induced activation of NF-\u03baB in mice tissue homogenates was significantly prevented by ARinhibition. Since activated macrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB-1 protein which actsas a mediator of inflammation [21], we next measured the effect of AR inhibition on theexpression of HMGB-1. As shown in Fig. 4E, increased expression of HMGB-1 protein wasobserved in CLP tissues as compared to sham controls and ARI treatment significantlyprevented CLP-induced HMGB-1. These results suggested that AR inhibition could preventCLP-induced inflammation by inhibiting redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-\u03baB -dependent expression of various inflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines.3.3. Prevention of CLP-induced activation of plasma Tissue Factor by AR inhibitionPrevious studies have shown that the use of anti-coagulants would be beneficial in preservingplatelets and organ functions in endotoxemia-model via mechanisms involving inactivation oftissue factor, which plays a critical role in the initiation of complex mechanisms in the processof blood clot which causes organ dysfunction [22]. We therefore, measured the activation oftissue factor in CLP-mice plasma. Our results (Fig. 5) show that tissue factor activity was muchhigher in CLP group as compared to CLP+ARI group of mice as well as sham-operated controlmice indicating that inhibition of AR could prevent secretion of tissue factor.4 DiscussionPolymicrobial sepsis is a serious medical condition characterized by shock, hypoxemia, andorgan dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation [1] and [23]. Although subjectsof all age groups upon severe bacterial infections can get sepsis, higher mortality has beenobserved in overweight, older age, intubated and immunocompromised patients[5]. Severesepsis results from the body\u2019s systemic over-response to infection that disrupts homeostasisthrough an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation [24], blood coagulation and impairedfibriolysis [21]. Even though controlling bacterial infections by aggressive antibiotics therapyand maintaining homeostasis in immune response saves a number of lives, 20-25% patientsdie because of multiorgan failure [4], [5] and [25]. Although precise mechanism(s) ofmultiorgan failure is not clearly understood, several clinical models have been developed toinvestigate the mechanism(s) involved in sepsis pathogenesis [26]. Among them, CLP-modelhas been shown to closely replicate the nature and course of clinical sepsis. This model is highlyreproducible and widely used to study the mechaninsm(s) of multiorgan failure as well as fortesting the efficacy of drugs [27].Uncontrolled generation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines has been noted inexperimental models of sepsis as well as in clinical settings. Early release of macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2and MCP-1 have been shownto be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock and multiorgan failure [28], [29], [30] and[31]. In our study, AR inhibitor administration resulted in a significant decrease in theseproinflammatory cytokines not only in the plasma and peritoneal fluids but in the heart as well.Thus the ability of AR inhibited mice to produce less inflammatory cytokines in response toCLP-induced sepsis could indicate the potential use of AR inhibitors in prevention of sepsisReddy et al. Page 5Cytokine. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 December 1.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscriptand its associated complications. It is well known that under oxidative stress induced byinfections, bacterial toxins and during various pathological conditions NF-\u03baB is significantlyactivated which regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses [10] and[18]. The mechanisms by which AR inhibition exerts an inhibitory effect on proinflammatorycytokine levels may involve the suppression of NF-\u03baB activity [11] and [29]. In fact, severalreports suggest that inhibition of NF-\u03baB could prevent inflammatory response observed insepsis. For example, antioxidants such as N-acetylcystene, ascorbic acid, and \u03b1-tocopherol[32], [33], [34] and [35] which prevent the activation of ROS-induced NF-\u03baB have been shownto protect animals and humans from septic shock. We have recently shown that AR inhibitorswhich act like anti-oxidants and prevent bacterial endotoxin, LPS-induced generation of ROSprevent the activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of inflammatory markers in macrophagesas well as in mice serum [9], [12], [13] and [14]. We have shown that AR-catalyzed reducedproducts of lipid aldehyde glutathione conjugates such as GS-DHN could mediate the signalingpathway that eventually increases transcription of inflammatory markers in vascular smoothmuscle cells and other cells [14]. The increased cytokines, chemokines and growth factorssubsequently initiate the signal transduction pathways that result in increased secretion ofinflammatory markers which cause inflammation and multi organ failure. Our cellular studiesusing vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages havedemonstrated that ROS-induced NF-\u03baB activation and transcription of inflammatory markerssuch as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2 and iNOS can be prevented by inhibiting AR [10], [11], [12],[13], [14] and [15]. In the present study also our results indicate that the release of bacteria intothe peritoneum by CLP-procedure causes a significant increase in various inflammatorymarkers in the peritoneal fluid which is significantly prevented by AR inhibitor. Since severalof the AR inhibitors have been found to be safe and have already been studied for phase-1 andphase-2 clinical trails for diabetic neuropathy [16] and [17], the use of AR inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drug would be less time consuming and if found as effective in human as inexperimental model of sepsis, they could be used therapeutically in the inflammatory disorderpatients. In summary, our results suggest that the AR inhibition has anti-inflammatory effectsin murine model of sepsis. Further studies are required to use AR inhibition as an excellenttherapeutic approach to treat sepsis especially those patients in which antibiotics though killthe bacteria, the circulating bacterial toxins including bacterial wall that takes several days toclear from the tissues cause fatal inflammatory disorders.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by NIH grant GM71036.

Inhibition of AR prevents inflammatory cytokines in mice heartsAfter 14 h of CLP, mice hearts were dissected out and homogenates were made. The levels ofvarious (as indicated in table under the figure) inflammatory markers were measured by usingRay Bio Mouse cytokine antibody array. The intensity of the spots was measured bydensitometry and compared with positive and negative controls. (A) Representative picture isshown. (B) Table showing the fold change was calculated by measuring the intensities ofindividual array spots and normalized with controls and compared with CLP group.Reddy et al. Page 12Cytokine.

AR inhibition prevents CLP-induced expression of COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in miceheart, spleen and kidneysAfter 14 h of CLP, mice hearts, spleen and kidneys were dissected out and homogenates weremade. Equal amounts of homogenates were subjected to Western Blot analysis using antibodiesagainst A) COX-2, B) iNOS, C) AR, D) p-p65 (NF-\u03baB), E) HMGB-1 and F)GAPDH. Panel1: heart, Panel 2: Spleen and Panel 3: Kidney. The antibody binding was detected by enhancedpico chemiluminescence (Pierce). The fold change was determined by densitometry scanning,as indicated at the top of the Western blot.Reddy et al. Page 13Cytokine.
