To investigate this possibility, we looked into the time relatedchanges of PrP proteins in the brains of TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice, a line modeling for heterozygous genetic prion diseaselinked to the E200K PrP mutation. We found that while oligomeric entities of mutant E199KPrP exist at all ages, aggregatesof wt PrP in the same brains presented only in advanced disease, indicating a late onset conversion process. We also showthat most PK resistant PrP in TgMHu2ME199K mice is soluble and truncated (PrPST), a pathogenic form never beforeassociated with prion disease. We next looked into brain samples from E200K patients and found that both PK resistant PrPs,PrPST as in TgMHu2ME199K mice, and \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 PrPSc as in infectious prion diseases, coincide in the patient\u2019s post mortembrains. We hypothesize that aberrant metabolism of mutant PrPs may result in the formation of previously unknown formsof the prion protein and that these may be central for the fatal outcome of the genetic prion condition.Citation: Friedman-Levi Y, Mizrahi M, Frid K, Binyamin O, Gabizon R (2013) PrPST, a Soluble, Protease Resistant and Truncated PrP Form Features in thePathogenesis of a Genetic Prion Disease.

Since then, PrPScwasestablished as the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019 marker of prion infection andits presence in scrapie infected sheep, BSE infected cattle and inhumans suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) was usedto confirm a prion disease diagnosis [2,3], while in its absence sucha verdict is mostly ruled out [4,5,6]. However, classical PrPSccouldnot be detected in brains of patients suffering from some forms ofgenetic prion diseases [5,7,8], which are autosomal dominantdisorders linked to mutations in the gene encoding the prionprotein (PrP) [9] [10]. PrPScis also undetected or present atmarginal levels in the brains of most transgenic mice modeling forgenetic prion diseases [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16].The most common genetic CJD (gCJD) is the one linked to theE200K PrP mutation (substituting lysine for glutamate) [17,18].This mutation was identified among Jews of Libyan origin as wellas in subjects of other communities around the world [19]. Notonly is E200K CJD relatively frequent, but is also the gCJD mostsimilar to sporadic CJD in age of onset, clinical and pathologicalpresentation, as well as in the accumulation of classical PrPScinthe brains of the affected subjects [20]. While most E200K CJDpatients are heterozygous for the mutation, disease presentationwas faster to some degree in a small number of homozygouspatients [21].To investigate whether the presence of an E200K mutation isenough to confer high levels of protease resistance and aggregationto the nascent mutant prion protein, E200K PrP in cell culturedmodels was investigated by diverse biochemical methods. It wasfound to be either readily digested by PK or otherwise resistant tomarginal PK concentrations [22,23]. Interestingly, E200K PrP inrecombinant form is spontaneously oxidized in its helix 3methionine residues, a covalent modification which precedes theconversion of PrPCinto PrPSc[24]. All this suggests that whileE200K PrP presents intrinsic properties in between those of PrPCand PrPSc, its full conversion into a disease related form may occuronly in-vivo in an age dependent form, concomitant with the lateonset nature of the disease.Our knowledge on levels and properties of disease relatedmutant PrPs in genetic prion diseases was gathered mostly frompost mortem samples [25]. To investigate the changes in mutantPrP properties at different time points in a late onset disease setup,we looked into the biochemical properties of PrP in brain samplesof TgMHu2ME199K mice. These mice, which model for E200KCJD, express human- mouse chimeric E199K PrP on a null (forhomozygous) or a wt PrP (for heterozygous) background. Micefrom both lines suffer from similar neurological symptoms from asearly as 5\u20136 month of age and deteriorated to a terminal conditionseveral months thereafter. During disease, TgMHu2ME199KPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69583mice accumulate a truncated form of PK resistant PrP recogniz-able by C-terminal PrP antibodies [26]. Like in the brains ofhuman E200K patients [27,28], infectious prions are spontane-ously formed in TgMHu2ME199K mice, mostly in the sickTgMHu2ME200K/wt mice, and only rarely in the sick TgMHu2-ME199K/ko, suggesting that the presence of a wt allele, while notrequired for disease presentation, may facilitate the transmission ofinfectivity to wt mice.We now show that E199K PrP in TgMHu2ME199K micepresent in oligomeric forms long before disease presentation,indicating partial aggregation, as oxidation, is an intrinsic propertyof this mutant PrP. Contrarily, PK resistant PrP is detected justbefore disease presentation and accumulates further with diseaseaggravation, indicating its formation is an age related effect. WtPrP aggregates can be identified in brains of heterozygous Tg miceonly when disease is well established, indicating the conversion ofwt PrP to a disease like form is an acquired property related to thestatus of the disease. Surprisingly, results from brain fractionationexperiments demonstrate that the truncated PK resistant PrP inthe TgMHu2ME199K mice present in soluble brain fractions, aswas recently suggested for pathological key proteins in otherneurodegenerative conditions [29,30,31]. Most important, wefound that both disease related PrP forms, the soluble, truncatedand PK resistant, hereby denominated PrPSTas well as the\u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 PrPSc, coincide in the brains of E200K patients. Wehypothesize that the metabolism of mutant PrP may result in theformation of previously unknown PrP forms, some of which maybe essential for the fatal outcome of the disease while others maybe more active in disease transmission.ResultsClinical disease and PrP accumulation in heterozygousand homozygous TgMH2ME199K miceExcept for rare cases related to family intermarriages [21], mostgenetic CJD patients are heterozygous for the mutation, therebyexpressing both mutant and wt PrP [32]. While we have shownpreviously that TgMHu2ME199K mice on a null or wtbackground present similar disease properties and kinetics [26],we looked again at this observation by calculating the individualtime points in which each mouse reaches score 2, a clearobservation point in disease aggravation (significant hind limb/sweakness). Using this calculation method, we show (fig. 1a) that themedian of disease aggravation is indeed very similar for both lines;5.2 months 60.8 for homozygous mice and 6.061.2 months forheterozygous mice. Interestingly, there is no statistical significantdifference between the kinetics of aggravation in both lines of mice(0.37 by T-test), indicating that a wt PrP allele is not a must fordisease presentation and progression. Consistent with these results,figure 1b shows that the levels and rate of PK resistant PrPaccumulation in the brain homogenates of TgMHu2ME199K/koand TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice are very similar, suggesting againthat wt PrP in genetic patients is not an obligatory part of thepathological process [33]. As published before, PK resistant PrP inthese mice present as a truncated form recognizable only by C-terminal aPrP antibodies [24,26], as the pAb RTC used infigure 1b, which cannot separate between the chimeric and wtallele.E199K PrP as compared to wt PrP aggregation propertiesAs opposed to the lack of a role for wt PrP in the onset andprogression of genetic prion disease, this is not the case for diseasetransmission to na\u0131\u0308ve animals. We have shown previously [24] thatwhile brains from sick TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice readilytransmitted disease to wt mice, only rare mice succumb to diseasewhen inoculated with samples from asymptomatic heterozygousbrains or even from sick TgMHu2ME199K/ko brains. Thisindicates that some levels of wt PrP in heterozygous TgMHu2-ME199K mice may convert into infectious prions when disease iswell established.Since we could not separate between truncated allele specificPK resistant PrP due to the lack of appropriate antibodies, welooked into the aggregation properties of full length wt and mutantPrP at different disease points. To this effect, we subjected sarkosylextracted brain homogenates of TgMHu2ME199K and wt miceto sucrose gradients that can separate between aggregates ofdifferent sizes and solubilized PrP forms. Fractions from thesegradients were subjected to immunoblotting with a PrP antibodiesthat can distinguish between wt and chimeric mouse-humanE199K PrP when at full length. Panel a in figure 2 describes thePrP epitopes of all antibodies used in this manuscript. Indeed, aPrP mAb IPC1 recognizes murine PrP but not chimeric MHu2Mforms, while aPrP mAb 3F4 recognizes the human parts ofchimeric E199K PrP, but not murine PrP as in the wt allele. Inpanel b, we show that PrP in wt mice, as recognized by IPC1, ispresent only in the low density fractions of the gradient, asexpected for PrPC, a membrane protein that is readily solubilizedin detergents. The same results (not shown) were obtained for wtPrP in mice brains of all ages. Contrarily, PrP in the brains ofTgMHu2ME199K/ko mice (as detected by aPrP mAb 3F4), isdispersed between all gradient fractions, indicating it mayintrinsically form oligomers of different sizes. Next, we lookedinto the aggregation properties of both PrPs in TgMHu2-ME199K/wt mice of different ages, before and after diseasepresentations. Fig. 2c demonstrates that while E199K PrP presentsthe same oligomerization levels from 1 month old mice through allages, wt PrP in the heterozygous mice is solubilized at young age,as is the case for PrPCin wt mice, but acquires aggregationproperties when clinical disease become apparent at older age, asis the case for 7 month old TgMHu2ME199K mice. These resultssuggest an \u2018\u2018in cell\u2019\u2019 infection process leading to the conversion ofwt PrP into a disease related form. As stated above, whether someof this aggregated wt PrP forms are also PK resistant cannot bedetermined by these tools.Truncated PK resistant PrP is present in the light fractionsof TgMHu2ME199K brains gradientsIn the brains of rodents affected with scrapie, PrPScis presentonly in the most aggregated fractions of a sucrose gradient [34].To test whether this is also the case for PrP in TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice, we digested gradients samples in the presence or absenceof PK and immunoblotted then either with a PrP mAb 6H4 (forfull length PrP) or a PrP pAbRTC (total+truncated). Figure 3shows that, as described for the TgMHu2ME199K/ko [26], PKresistant PrP in these mice can only be identified by pAb RTC (aC-terminal PrP ) and not by 6H4. However, and contrarily tobrains of prion infected mice, most PK resistant PrP in the brainsof the TgMHu2ME199K mice, both of wt (fig. 3) or ablated (notshown) background, could be detected in the light fractions,representing either a soluble protein or a detergent solubilizedmembrane protein. This is a surprising result not only due to thedifferent properties of PrPcin the TgMHu2ME199K mice ascompared to classical PrPScin transmissible prion disease, but alsoin view of the intrinsic aggregation properties of this mutant PrP.We speculate that degradation of aberrantly folded mutant PrPmay result also in soluble truncated products, each of them withdifferent biochemical properties.Soluble PK Resistant PrP in Genetic Prion DiseasePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69583Truncated PrP in human gCJD brain samplesTo test whether truncated forms of PrP as described for theTgMHu2ME199K mice also feature in the human relevantdisease, sucrose gradients as above were loaded with sarkosylextracted samples of E200K CJD brains, originating from postmortem samples. Fractions collected from these gradients weredigested in the presence or absence of PK and immunoblottedwith aPrP mAb 6H4 and with aPrP pAb RTC, as done above forthe TgMHu2ME199K samples. Figure 4 shows that while a PrPmAb 6H4 detects classical forms of PrPScin the heavy fractions ofthe gradient after proteolysis, pAb RTC also detects solubletruncated forms of PrP before and after PK digestion, albeit withless intensity than the ones observed in the PK treatedTgMHu2ME199K brains. The fact that truncated PK resistantforms of PrP could be found in the light fraction of both E200Khuman patients and sick TgMHu2ME199K mice indicates thisform of PrP most probably plays a role in the pathological processleading to fatal disease in genetic cases, the nature of which is stillunknown. Regretfully, and since we can only look into an \u2018\u2018endpoint\u2019\u2019 situation in the human samples, it is difficult to determinewhether \u2018\u2018classical PrPSc\u2019\u2019 starts to accumulate in these patients atan early or late stage in the disease process. Also in theTgMHu2ME199K mice we are lacking part of the time framespectrum since our ethical permit does not allow us to follow upvery sick mice for long periods of time, but rather we have tosacrifice them when they cannot reach by themselves to food andwater.PrPST: A truncated, PK resistant and soluble diseaserelated PrPDisease related PrP forms presenting in light fractions of brainhomogenate gradients may be membrane proteins solubilized insarkosyl or bona fide soluble proteins. To distinguish betweenthese possibilities, we subjected samples from E200K CJD patientsand from TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice, as well as brains samplesfrom na\u0131\u0308ve and scrapie RML infected mice to the followingfractionation protocol (see figure 5a). First, brain homogenates (seemethods for details), after a 18000 rpm centrifugation wereFigure 1. Similar disease kinetics and PrP accumulation in heterozygous and homozygous TgMH2ME199K mice. (a) The percentage ofmice presenting a score ,2 in both E199K/ko and E199K/wt lines as related to age. Median was 5.260.8 for TgMHu2ME199K/ko mice and 6.061.2 forTgMHu2ME199K/wt mice. (b) PK-resistant PrP levels are similar in both lines as related to age.

To obtain a clearsupernatant carrying only soluble proteins, this first supernatantwas subjected twice to ultracentrifugation at 100000 g. Thesupernatant of the last centrifugation was digested in the presenceor absence of PK. In parallel the first pellet was subjected toosmotic shock before ultracentrifugation (to eliminate traces ofsupernatant material) and subsequently the pellet was solubilizedin the presence of 2% sarkosyl and centrifuged at 100000 g. Thepellet and supernatant of this last procedure were digested in thepresence and absence of PK. Finally, the sarkosyl pellet andsupernatants, as well as the high speed soluble fractions wereimmunoblotted with two C-terminal a PrP antibodies; pAb RTCand EP1802Y (EP) , a rabbit a PrP mAb directed against theCITQYER ESQAYYQRGS sequence present at the C-terminalpart of human PrP, just before the PrP GPI anchor. All PKdigestions were performed in the presence of 2% sarkosyl, toensure the accessibility to the protease in case of proteinmembrane interactions.Results of these experiments are depicted in Figure 5b&c.surprisingly, figure 2b shows that significant levels of PrP arepresent in soluble fractions of all brains, as opposed to the generalnotion that the prion proteins are mostly associated withmembranes. However, only in the genetic disease related samples,E200K human brains and TgMHu2ME199K brains, are thesesoluble PrP forms resistant to PK digestion in a truncated form.Interestingly, some of the PrPSTforms are recognized only byRTC and not by the EP antibody, indicating they may betruncated not only in its N-terminal but also in its C-terminal part.Most important, no PrPSTform was found in the soluble brainfractions of scrapie infected mice, indicating that genetic andtransmissible prion disease differ in some mechanistic features.Figure 2.

This was shown by aPrP immunohistochemistry in TgMHu2ME199K brains andTgMHu2ME199K primary fibroblasts [26,35], which showextensive intra cell immunostaining. In addition, we were unableto identify PrPSTin the CSF of E200K patients (not shown).However, our results do not rule out the possibility that some levelsof PrPCand PrPSTare secreted indeed into the intercellular space.Only the TgMHu2ME199K mice show PrPSTforms in thesarkosyl soluble fractions. Whether this relates to traces of thecytosolic form, or otherwise demonstrates that PrPSTis formed oncell membranes and is shaded to the inside or the outside of cellsafter cutting its GPI anchor is unknown [36]. Interestingly, all butnormal brain samples present PK resistant PrP in the sarkosylextracted pellets each of those with a different pattern and at lowlevels at the TgMHu2ME199K mice. We may therefore concludethat while the transmissible form of prion disease (RML) showsonly classical PrPSc, the genetically affected brains also present aunique soluble form, PrPST, which in the Tg mice constitutes thegreat majority of disease related PrP. We hypothesize that PrPSTisthe product of aberrant E200K PrP metabolism as related to agefactors and its accumulation may be an important feature in thepathological mechanism of genetic forms of prion disease.DiscussionTaking advantage of our TgMHu2ME199K/wt model ofheterozygous E200K gCJD, we looked into the time relatedchanges in the biochemical properties of E199K and wt PrP fromthe asymptomatic early age to full blown disease. We found thatthe disease burden lies fully on mutant PrP, since the addition of awt allele did not affect disease time course or levels of PK resistantPrP accumulation. In addition, we established that some of theE199K PrP presents intrinsically in oligomeric forms even in theearly asymptomatic stages, while the accumulation of a solubletruncated and PK resistant form (PrPST), most probably cytosolic,commences shortly before disease manifestation. Contrarily, wtPrP in the heterozygous mice maintains PrPClike properties untilmuch later in the life of the mice and starts to aggregate at 7months of age, when disease is already at an advanced stage.Most important, we show that brains of human E200K gCJDpatients comprise both classical PrPScand PrPST, the last onerecognizable only by C-terminal a PrP antibodies. Since ourTgMHu2ME199K mice succumb to neurological fatal disease,and PrPSTis by far the major disease related PrP formaccumulated in these animals, we speculate that PrPSTmay bethe key feature of this genetic form of prion disease. Accumulationof classical PrPScmay be a late effect induced by the conversion ofwt PrP in heterozygous patients. However, while in onehomozygous E200K CJD patient, classical PrPSccould not bedetected [21], we cannot conclude at this point that theaccumulation of classical PrPScin genetic patients only appearswhen wt PrP is expressed. It will be interesting to test whether thisor other forms of PrPSTare present in patients carrying otherpathogenic PrP mutations as well as in sporadic CJD patients,each of which may show distinct PrP accumulation properties.The generation of PrPSTmay result from the aberrant foldingand abnormal metabolism and degradation of E200K PrP. Wehave shown previously that E200K PrP is spontaneously oxidizedin its helix 3 Met residues [24], probably due to an increase insolvent exposure of the relevant helix in the presence of K atposition 200 [37]. Such oxidation may provide the structuralchanges required for the formation of oligomeric and solubledisease related forms, such as PrPST. Cytosolic PrPSTmay nextactivate the UPR system, resulting in the global reduction inprotein synthesis and dysregulation of elF2a [38]. In addition, weFigure 3.

Indeed, it is the levels of soluble Tauand not of Tau incorporated into neurofibrillary tangles whichreduction led to the cessation of neuron loss and the improvementof memory functions [41]. Also, the removal of amyloid plaques byAb immunotherapy failed to improve the clinical status ofAlzheimer patients [42]. If a similar mechanism exists for priondiseases, it is mostly PrPSTand less so classical PrPScwhich may bethe key neurotoxic entity, at least in gCJD linked to the E200KPrP mutation.In addition to an unknown number of subclinical BSE cases, asignificant number of people at risk to develop prion disease arecarriers of pathogenic PrP mutations. We have shown here thatthe key pathogenic events may differ significantly betweentransmissible and genetic prion diseases. While the first one mayrelate mostly to the process converting PrPCto classical PrPSc,mutant PrP forms may generate metabolic abnormalities formearly age, resulting in activation of stress related UPR signals andaccumulation of PrPST, a soluble PK resistant PrP form. Thisimplies that treatments for genetic patients and even more soprevention of disease manifestation for individuals at genetic prionrisk cannot be evaluated only by disappearance of classical PrPScfrom cells in culture or even by delay of disease onset in scrapieinfected rodents, but should rather be tested in appropriatetransgenic models that mimic for genetic prion diseases.Figure 5.

Brain human samples were receivedfollowing postmortem examinations from the Pathology Depart-ments of several hospitals in the country. Immunoblottingexperiments on such samples, as the ones described in thismanuscript, are part of the routine pathological protocol appliedon brains from suspected CJD cases. Our laboratory in theHadassah Department of Neurology is the national referral centerfor CJD diagnosis (genetic and biochemical testing). The testing ofthese samples was approved by both the safety and ethicalauthorities of the Hadassah University Hospital. Since all cases ofCJD and alike negative controls are unable to sign for such testslong before their death due to their medical condition, the relativesof these patients provided informed written consent for PMstudies. Enabling close relatives to provide such consent is thestandard policy of the Israeli Ministry of Health.Mice scoringTgMHu2ME199K mice from both lines (PrP ablated or wtbackgrounds) were followed twice a week for the appearance ofspontaneous neurological disease. Mice were scored for diseaseseverity and progression according to the scale of clinical signs aspreviously described [26]. Briefly, partial hind limbs weakness = 1,significant hind limb/s weakness or paralysis = 2, full paralysis inone limb = 3, full paralysis in both limbs = 4, death = 5. Mice weresacrificed according to the ethical requirements of the HebrewUniversity Animal Authorities when too sick or paralyzed to reachfood and water, or after losing 20% body weight.Western blot analysisBrains were homogenized at 10% (W/V) in 10 mM Tris- HCl,pH 7.4 and 0.3 M sucrose. For Proteinase K digestions, 30 ml of10% brain homogenates extracted with 2% sarkosyl on ice wereincubated with 30 to 40 mg/ml Proteinase K for 30 min at 37uC.Samples were subsequently subjected to SDS PAGE andimmunoblotted with diverse anti-PrP antibodies, as described inFigure 2a.Sucrose gradients of brain homogenatesSarkosyl extracted brain homogenates were subjected to sucrosegradients as described [34]. Briefly, 140 to 300 ml of 10% brainhomogenates extracted in the presence of 2% Sarkosyl wereoverlaid on a sucrose gradient composed of layers of increasingconcentrations of sucrose (10\u201360%). Gradients were then centri-fuged for 1 h at 55000 rpm in a Sorval mini-ultracentrifuge andsubsequently 9 samples were collected from the top to the bottom.2/3 volume of each individual sample was then subjected toProteinase K digestion and immunoblotted with diverse anti PrPAbs.Brain FractionationTwo ml of 10% brain homogenates in 10 mM Tris-HCl,pH 7.4/0.3M sucrose from human E200K gCJD patients, 8months old transgenic E199K/wt mouse, 8 months old normalmice and scrapie RML mice at terminal stages of disease weresubjected to centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4uC.Subsequently, 300 ml of each supernatant was subjected twice toultra-centrifugation (45,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4uC) in order toeliminate traces of membranes from the soluble protein fraction.Proteins in the last supernatant were concentrated by methanolprecipitation, and then resuspended in STE (saline-tris-EDTA)(fraction I). The initial pellet containing membrane proteins wasresuspended in DDW and ultra-centrifuged to dilute traces ofsupernatant material, and the pellet resuspended and extracted in2% sarkosyl before ultra-centrifugation in 45,000 rpm for 1 hourat 4uC. The detergent soluble fraction (II) and the pellet ofmembrane proteins (III), together with fraction I were digested inthe presence or absence of 40 ug/ml PK and immunoblotted withC-terminal aPrP antibodies.Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: YF MM RG .
