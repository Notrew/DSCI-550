"Association and Evidence for Linked Recognition of Type IVSecretion System Proteins VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 inAnaplasma marginaleKaitlyn Morse,a Junzo Norimine,a Guy H. Palmer,a,b Eric L. Sutten,a Timothy V. Baszler,a and Wendy C. BrownaProgram in Vector-Borne Diseases, Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology,a and Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health,b Washington StateUniversity, Pullman, Washington, USALike several other bacterial pathogens, Anaplasma marginale has an outer membrane that induces complete protection frominfection and disease. However, the proteins that confer protective immunity and whether protection requires interacting pro-teins and/or linked T-cell and immunoglobulin G epitopes are not known. Our goal is to target the conserved type IV secretionsystem (T4SS) to identify conserved, immunogenic membrane proteins that are interacting and linked recognition candidates.Linked recognition is a process by which a B cell is optimally activated by a helper T cell that responds to the same, or physicallyassociated, antigen. A. marginale T4SS proteins VirB2, VirB4-1, VirB4-2, VirB6-1, VirB7, VirB8-2, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10,VirB11, and VirD4 were screened for their ability to induce IgG and to stimulate CD4\ufffd T cells from outer membrane-vaccinatedcattle. VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 induced the strongest IgG and T-cell responses in the majority of cattle, although three ani-mals with major histocompatibility complex class II DRB3 restriction fragment length polymorphism types 8/23, 3/16, and 16/27lacked T-cell responses to VirB9-1, VirB9-1 and VirB9-2, or VirB9-2 and VirB10, respectively. For these animals, VirB9-1-,VirB9-2-, and VirB10-specific IgG production may be associated with T-cell help provided by responses to an interacting proteinpartner(s). Interacting protein partners indicated by far-Western blotting were confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays andrevealed, for the first time, specific interactions of VirB9-1 with VirB9-2 and VirB10. The immunogenicity and interactions ofVirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 justify their testing as a linked protein vaccine against A. marginale.Anaplasma marginale is an obligate intraerythrocytic Gram-negative bacterium causing bovine anaplasmosis. Immuniza-tion of cattle with A. marginale outer membranes (OM) and cross-linked OM proteins can induce complete protection againstdisease and infection (10, 43, 57). However, the well-characterizedimmunodominant major surface proteins 1 to 5 (MSP1 to MSP5),which include antigenically variant MSP2 and MSP3, do not in-duce equivalent protection against A. marginale infection (1, 46,47, 49, 50). Because immunodominant MSPs are not protective,we have focused on identifying subdominant and conserved sur-face proteins, including those that associate within the membranethat may be important components of the protective OM vaccine.Among the subdominant antigens identified in the OM are typeIV secretion system (T4SS) proteins. Several T4SS proteins in-duced CD4 T cell responses, including gamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd)production, and were recognized by IgG2 in cattle immunizedwith the OM vaccine (32\u201334, 56). These type 1 immune responsesare associated with protection against A. marginale infection incattle immunized with OM (9, 10, 50).The T4SS is a 1.1-MDa protein complex that spans the outerand inner bacterial membranes and has been most widely studiedin Agrobacterium tumefaciens (13, 17). Typically, the T4SS is madeup of 12 interacting VirB/D membrane proteins, several of whichare likely to be surface exposed (14) and are thus targets for neu-tralizing and protective immune responses. The T4SS core com-plex is made up of 14 copies of interacting VirB7, VirB9, andVirB10, which form a complex that was crystallized and studiedwith Escherichia coli VirB homologues TraN (VirB7), TraO(VirB9), and TraF (VirB10) (13, 17). The Agrobacterium VirB pro-teins also assemble into a pilus made up of VirB2, VirB5, andVirB7 (28, 29, 53, 54). There are three nucleotide triphosphate(NTP)-utilizing T4SS proteins\u2014VirB4, VirB11, and VirD4 \u2014thatsupply energy for substrate translocation, and VirD4 specificallyacts as the substrate-coupling protein (3, 11). VirB6 and VirB8assemble the T4SS apparatus at the cell pole and also make up thecore complex (24, 25, 27). The T4SS proteins harbored by A. mar-ginale and other members of the family Anaplasmataceae areunique because they are encoded by two copies of virB4, virB8, andvirB9, four or more copies of virB6, and multiple copies of virB2.There are single copies of virB3, virB7, virB10, virB11, and virD4,whereas homologues of virB1 and virB5 have not been identified(7, 19, 20). The function of the T4SS in A. marginale has not beendetermined, but in a pathogen that has undergone reductive evo-lution, retention of these genes indicates their requirement forinvasion and survival within erythrocytes and/or tick cells (19,20). Because Anaplasmataceae lack lipopolysaccharides (7, 20),several T4SS proteins may be surface exposed where they could betargeted by neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, T4SS proteinsinteract within the bacterial membrane so associated proteinscould provide linked recognition for T-cell\u2013B-cell interactions.Linked recognition was described in the 1970s by Mitchison,Received 11 August 2011 Returned for modification 13 September 2011Accepted 20 October 2011Published ahead of print 28 October 2011Editor: F.

T cells help B cells to undergo somatic hypermutationand isotype switching through cognate interaction and cytokinesecretion. However, linked recognition can also occur with twoassociated proteins, where one has B cell epitopes and a secondprovides T-cell epitopes. For A. marginale, this was suggested instudies with MSP1, a heteromer consisting of covalently associ-ated MSP1a and MSP1b (35, 60). In these studies, MSP1a-specificT cells provided help to B cells specific for MSP1b to promoteincreased IgG production (8, 36). Immunization with physicallyassociated B- and T-cell antigens achieves long-lasting immuno-logical memory to the B-cell antigen and is a common strategyused for vaccination against bacterial polysaccharides that lackT-cell epitopes (26, 52).In the present study, we test the hypothesis that subdominantT4SS proteins of A. marginale that induce an IgG response but noCD4\ufffd T-cell response in an OM-vaccinated individual interactwith a T4SS protein(s) that does stimulate T-cell proliferationwhich could provide T-cell help. We present evidence for thelinked recognition of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10, which arenaturally associated in A. marginale, and a basis for testing theselinked T4SS proteins as a vaccine for anaplasmosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSImmunization of six haplotype-diverse cattle with A. marginale OM. St.Maries strain A. marginale OM were isolated as previously described fromsplenectomized bovine C31919 blood with 40.4% bacteremia (34, 43, 48).Five age-matched Holstein steers and one Holstein cow with various ma-jor histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II haplotypes were pur-chased from the Washington State University (WSU) dairy. Bovine lym-phocyte antigen (BoLA) MHC class II DRB3 types were determined byrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of exon 2 ofthe DRB3 gene (44, 51, 55, 59). Animals (DRB3 RFLP types) used in thepresent study were cared for according to an approved Institutional Ani-mal Care and Use Center (IUCAC) protocol for WSU and were desig-nated by number (type) as follows: 35113 (11/22), 35141 (22/24), 35160(3/16), 35280 (16/27), 35287 (16/22), and 583 (8/23). It is important tonote that the haplotypes represented by the six OM-immunized cattle arethe most abundant haplotypes of Holsteins in Washington and Canada(unpublished data and reference 55). Cattle were immunized four timessubcutaneously with 60 \ufffdg of OM emulsified in saponin, at 0, 2, 4, and 8weeks as previously described (34). Four immunizations were used toeffectively prime cattle to these subdominant antigens so that T-cell andantibody responses would be detected (33, 34). All six cattle producedspecific antibody, determined by immunoblotting, and had statisticallysignificant peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferative re-sponses to A. marginale OM, compared to preimmunization responses(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).Expression of recombinant proteins. Full-length recombinant T4SSproteins were expressed from the A. marginale St. Maries strain. Genesencoding VirB9-1 (AM097), VirB9-2 (AM1315), and VirB10 (AM1314)were cloned into pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion vector and expressed as pre-viously described with C-terminal FLAG and 6\ufffdHis tags (33). Recombi-nant VirB7 (AM306) with just a C-terminal 6\ufffdHis tag was also clonedinto the pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion vector and expressed and purified aspreviously described (56). Genes encoding VirB2 (AM030), VirB4-1(AM814), VirB4-2 (AM1053), the first fragment of VirB6-1 (AM813 F1),VirB8-2 (AM1316), VirB11 (AM1313), and VirD4 (AM1312) were clonedinto the pEXP1-DEST vector (Invitrogen), with N-terminal 6\ufffdHis andC-terminal FLAG tags, and expressed in BL-21 DE3 pLysS One Shot E. coli(Invitrogen). Primers used for all of these proteins were described previ-ously (56). Plasmid DNA was extracted from E. coli and sequencing wasperformed using the BigDye kit and ABI Prism automated sequence (Ap-plied Biosystems) as described previously (56).The negative control protein Babesia bovis merozoite surface antigen 1(MSA1) (31) was expressed using the amplified gene from Mo7 genomicDNA with the forward primer (GCCGATACTTCAATCGTCCTTCC)and reverse primer without a stop codon (TTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTATAGTCTGTACCCTGTTGTCCTTGGAGG) encoding a C-terminalFLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). The thermal cycling parameters consistedof 40 cycles of melting at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 30 s, andextension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. The plasmid DNA was excised from agarosegels and purified using a Genelute agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich). Am-plicons were cloned into the pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion expression vector(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and plasmid DNAwas extracted from E. coli using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA puri-fication system (Promega) and sequenced.Colonies with the correct sequence were grown to mid log phase in LBbroth containing 50 \ufffdg of carbenicillin/ml and induced using 0.2% ara-binose for pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion constructs or 1 to 3 mM IPTG(isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside) for the pEXP1-DEST constructs.LB broth used for the expression of rVirB8-2 contained 50 \ufffdg of carben-icillin/ml and 34 \ufffdg of chloramphenicol/ml. Induced E. coli was centri-fuged at 3,800 \ufffd g, and the pellets were resuspended in denaturing lysisbuffer (6 M guanidine HCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl [pH7.8]), sonicated twice on maximum strength for 3 min, and frozen over-night at \ufffd80\u00b0C.Purification of recombinant proteins. All proteins were purified us-ing the hybrid conditions according to the Probond nickel purification kitinstructions (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations were determined withthe Quick Start Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and purity was assessedusing 1 or 10 \ufffdg/well separated by using Coomassie blue-stained precastsodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)4 to 20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad).MS/MS analysis of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. Bands corre-sponding to 20 and 40 kDa for rVirB7, 50 and 100 kDa for rVirB9-1 andrVirB9-2, and 65 and 130 kDa for rVirB10 were excised from Coomassieblue-stained gels, destained (50% methanol, 5% acetic acid), dehydratedwith 100% acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),quenched with 50 mM iodoacetamide, and digested with 20 ng of trypsin(Promega)/\ufffdl. The peptides were subjected to tandem mass spectrometric(MS/MS) fragmentation on a high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC)-coupled quadruple-time of flight (Q-TOF) MS instrument lo-cated at University of Idaho, Environmental Biotechnology Institute.Fragment ion lists and the identified peptide sequences were searchedagainst the Mascot databases that contain A. marginale, E. coli, or NationalCenter for Biotechnology Information all entries. Identification of theprotein was based upon the Mascot score, the probability, and the mass.One missed trypsin cleavage, fixed carbamidomethyl modifications, andvariable oxidation were allowed during the search. A probability of \ufffd95%showed the peptide match was not a random occurrence, and the individ-ual ion score is reported as \ufffd10 log10 P, where P is the probability. An ionscore greater than 19 has significant identity.Determination of serological responses to T4SS proteins by immu-noblotting. Purified recombinant T4SS proteins (1 to 2 \ufffdg) were loadedonto a 4 to 20% precast gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) withdenaturing sample buffer (8.5 mM Tris, 15% SDS, 50% glycerol, 12%\ufffd-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue), electrophoresed at 100 Vfor 1.5 h, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 Vfor 1 h. The membrane was blocked overnight with blocking buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% PVP40). OM-immunebovine sera that had been extensively adsorbed with protease-inhibitedand sonicated BL21 or Top10 E. coli (Invitrogen) cells that containedeither no vector or a vector encoding MSA1 were diluted 1:100 and addedto the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times withwash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1%PVP40). A 1:20,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeledMorse et al.216 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgrecombinant protein G (Zymed) was added for 1 h, and blots were thenwashed extensively with wash buffer. ECL Western blotting reagent sub-strate (Thermo Scientific) was applied for 2 min. Preimmune, adsorbedsera from all animals were also used at a 1:100 dilution on the blots con-taining all of the T4SS proteins to rule out nonspecific IgG binding. Afterpositive IgG responses were identified for a given animal and protein, thesame procedure was followed as described above, except sera were diluted1:300 to 1:10,000.T-cell proliferation assays. To establish T-cell lines, PBMC were de-pleted of CD8\ufffd cells and \ufffd\ufffd T cells prior to antigen stimulation by incu-bation with sodium azide-free monoclonal antibodies (MAbs; 3 \ufffdg/ml),followed by complement lysis (33). The antibodies were anti-CD8\ufffd IgG2a(7C2B), anti-CD8\ufffd IgM (BAQ111A), anti-TCR\ufffd IgG2b (GB21A), andanti-TCR\ufffd IgM (CACT61A) obtained from the WSU Monoclonal Anti-body Center. Two-week cell lines were generated from CD8- and \ufffd\ufffd-T-cell-depleted PBMC by stimulating for 1 week with 5 \ufffdg of OM/ml andrested for 1 week as previously described (33). The efficiency of depletionwas confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, whichshowed the T cells were composed of 93.4 to 96.7% CD4\ufffd T cells, 1.1 to2.4% CD8\ufffd T cells, and 2.2 to 2.4% \ufffd\ufffd T cells. Proliferation assays wereperformed in triplicate with 1 and 10 \ufffdg of recombinant T4SS proteins/ml, as described previously (33, 56). Positive controls included A. mar-ginale OM and 10% T-cell growth factor and negative controls includeduninfected red blood cell membranes (URBC) and B. bovis MSA1 alsoused at 1 and 10 \ufffdg/ml. T-cell proliferation was quantified by incorpora-tion of 0.25 \ufffdCi/well [3H]thymidine. The results are presented as stimu-lation indices (SI), calculated as the mean counts per minute (cpm) of cellscultured with antigen/mean cpm of cells cultured with medium. The SIfor the different T4SS antigens were compared to the SI for the matchingconcentration of MSA1 using Dunnett\u2019s test, a one-way multiple-comparison test. Statistically significant T-cell stimulation by an antigenwas set at a P value of \ufffd0.05.Preparation of antibodies specific for VirB7, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, andVirB10. Rabbits were used in the present study in compliance with theWSU IUCAC. Purified recombinant proteins were excised from the SDS-PAGE gels and trypsin-digested for Q-TOF MS analysis to confirm thatthe purified protein was the protein of interest. Recombinant VirB7,rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10 were emulsified with 50% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 50% TiterMax Gold adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich)to make a final concentration of 200 \ufffdg of protein/ml, and 100 \ufffdg ofprotein was inoculated subcutaneously into rabbits at 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11weeks (4 to 6 times) until the immunization was successful, which wasdetermined by Western blotting with pre- and postimmunization seradiluted 1:500. A negative control rabbit antiserum was made by PacificImmunology, using Freund complete and incomplete adjuvants and afragment of a B. bovis nuclear-encoded protein, acyl carrier protein(ACP). The ACP fragment from amino acids 68 to 148 was expressed inpTrcHIS TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen) and purified usingdenaturing conditions on a nickel column, followed by electroelution ofthe gel-embedded protein.Prior to purification of rabbit IgG, 5 ml of each rabbit serum wasincubated with 3 ml of crude Top10 E. coli lysate expressing MSA1 for 1 hin binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate [pH 7.0]) at room temper-ature and centrifuged to remove nonspecific antibodies. The adsorbedantisera were buffer-exchanged twice by diluting with binding buffer andcentrifuging using 15-ml Amicon 10k filters (Millipore). Subsequently, aHiTrap protein A column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) was used to purifyIgG from the sera according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Purified IgGwas buffer exchanged with sterile PBS and concentrated with an Amicon10-kDa cutoff filter, and the final concentration of IgG was determinedwith a Bio-Rad Bradford assay. IgGs were purified on protein A columns,the purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the specificity was determinedon immunoblots with 1 \ufffdg of each recombinant T4SS protein, 10 \ufffdg of A.marginale OM, and 2 \ufffdg of adsorbed and purified IgG/ml. Secondaryantibody was alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbitIgG(H\ufffdL) (Invitrogen) diluted 1:10,000, and blots were developed withthe Western Star chemiluminescence kit (Applied Biosystems).Far-Western blotting. Far-Western blotting was performed as previ-ously described (4, 12, 62) with the following modifications and underconditions of protein denaturation and renaturation. SDS-PAGE was per-formed with 1 \ufffdg of each recombinant protein loaded per well on 4 to20% gradient gels and electrophoresis at 100 V for 1.5 h. After transfer tonitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h, the nitrocellulose membranewith recombinant T4SS protein was first incubated with 6 M guanidinehydrochloride\u201320 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)\u201350 mM KCl\u201310 mM MgCl2\u20131mM DTT\u2013 0.1% Nonidet P40 \u20132% milk (GuHCl buffer) for 30 min atroom temperature, then successively incubated for 30 min each with 3 Mand 1.5 M GuHCl buffer at room temperature, then incubated with 0.6 MGuHCl buffer at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, and finally incubated with buffer lackingGuHCl overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was blocked with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)\u2013150 mM NaCl (TBS) with 5% milk for 3 h. Two far-Western membranes were run in tandem. One membrane was incubatedwith a 1:2,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-His MAb (Qiagen) toconfirm proteins on the membrane after denaturing (see Fig. S2 in thesupplemental material). The second membrane was used to identify atarget recombinant protein interacting with another recombinant pro-tein. To determine whether the target recombinant protein (VirB9-1,VirB9-2, or VirB10) bound to a prey recombinant T4SS protein(s), themembrane containing 1 \ufffdg of each transferred prey protein was incu-bated with 10 \ufffdg of target protein in 5 ml of TBS with 5% milk overnightat 4\u00b0C. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS containing0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Rabbit antiserum, adsorbed with Top10 E. colilysate expressing MSA1 and directed against the target protein (rVirB9-1,rVirB9-2, or rVirB10), was added to the membrane at a 1:500 dilution inTBS plus 5% milk, and the excess was washed off. The membrane wasincubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of AP-conjugated goat anti-rabbitIgG(H\ufffdL) for 1 h and then washed extensively with TBST and developedusing the Western-Star chemiluminescent substrate.Determining the binding coefficients of interacting rVirB9-1,rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. Serial dilutions (0.5 to 5.0 \ufffdg) of rVirB9-2 andrVirB10 were applied to a dot blot apparatus and used to find the bindingcoefficient to rVirB9-1 (12). Recombinant VirB9-1 was also applied to thedot blot as a positive control, and a higher concentration of (0.5 to 10.0\ufffdg) rMSA1 was used as a negative control for background subtraction.The dot blot was developed using the same procedure as for far-Westernblotting described above using 10 \ufffdg of rVirB9-1 to probe the blot and a1:500 dilution of adsorbed polyclonal anti-VirB9-1 rabbit serum to detectrVirB9-1. Densitometry analysis of the spots containing interacting pro-teins or controls was performed with ImageJ 1.43 software from NationalInstitutes of Health. The data were fit to a standard one-site saturationbinding curve Y \ufffd Ymax (X)/(KD \ufffd X), where Y is the intensity of the spot,X is concentration of the protein on the membrane, and KD is the bindingassociation constant using SigmaPlot 10.0. From this equation of the linethe binding association constants were found for rVirB9-1 binding torVirB9-2 and rVirB10.Production of MAbs. Mice were used in the present study in compli-ance with the WSU IUCAC. Two female BALB/c mice were immunizedsubcutaneously with 20 \ufffdg of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, or rVirB10 emulsifiedin an equal volume of complete Freund adjuvant for a total volume of 150\ufffdl. Mice received three booster immunizations at 2-week intervals with 20\ufffdg of antigen in incomplete Freund adjuvant. Pre- and postimmunizationsera were used to probe blots to detect specific protein in native OM. Afinal immunization with 10 \ufffdg of protein in 100 \ufffdl of PBS was givenintravenously, and spleens were removed 3 days later for hybridoma fu-sion. Fusion and limiting dilution cloning were performed as describedpreviously (63). Hybridomas were screened for a positive reaction onimmunoblots of all three recombinant proteins, as well as the OM. Hy-bridomas that reacted specifically with the recombinant protein of inter-est, as well as native protein, were selected for cloning. Supernatants fromclones were similarly screened, and three clones were selected for MAbLinked Recognition of A. marginale T4SS ProteinsJanuary 2012 Volume 80 Number 1 iai.asm.org 217http://iai.asm.orgproduction. These are 133/248.14.1.28 specific for VirB9-1 (IgG1), 137/774.8.7 specific for VirB9-2 (IgG2b), and 138/481.3.9 specific for VirB10(IgG1).Immunoprecipitation. A high concentration of OM was used for im-munoprecipitation because the T4SS proteins are not abundant (34). Thenonionic detergent n-dodecyl \ufffd-D-maltoside (DM) was used for solubili-zation to help maintain native protein conformation and the natural hy-drophobic interaction or hydrogen bonding of the membrane proteins. A.marginale OM were solubilized for at least 4 h in DM (Sigma-Aldrich) at4\u00b0C with rotation to yield a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 2% DM,and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at4\u00b0C. A 350-\ufffdl aliquot of supernatant was used for each immunoprecipi-tation reaction. Protein A-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG (2 \ufffdg) specificfor VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10, or B. bovis ACP (negative control) wasincubated with the solubilized OM proteins for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with rocking.Protein A-agarose (20 \ufffdl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, followedby incubation for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, with rocking. The native protein complexeswere centrifuged at 660 \ufffd g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed fourtimes with 400 \ufffdl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8)\u2013150 mM NaCl\u2013 0.1% Non-idet P40 and once with sterile PBS. For analysis, the pellet was immediatelyresuspended in 0.3 M Tris-HCl\u20135% SDS\u201350% glycerol\u2013100 mM dithio-threitol\u2013tracking dye (pH 6.8 [Lane Marker Sample Buffer; Thermo Sci-entific]) to yield a total volume of 95 \ufffdl in 1\ufffd sample buffer, and 10 \ufffdl wasloaded per well on 4 to 20% gradient gels and electrophoresed at 100 V for1.5 h. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h, theinteracting proteins were determined on Western blots probed with 1\ufffdg/ml of polyclonal rabbit IgG specific for a candidate interacting proteinpartner or for the target protein. After extensive washing in I-block con-taining 0.3% Tween 20, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugatedClean-Blot (Thermo Scientific) that only binds to intact antibodies, ac-cording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, washed with I-block containing0.3% Tween 20, and developed with the ECL Western blotting reagent(Thermo Scientific). MAbs used at 2 \ufffdg/ml specific for MSP5 (AnaF16C1)and MSP2 (AnaR49a) (38) were also used to probe the blots for additionalspecificity controls. The blots probed with anti-MSP5 were incubatedwith HRP-Clean-Blot and developed as described above, and the anti-MSP2 probed blots were incubated with AP-conjugated goat anti-mouseIgG\ufffdIgM (Invitrogen) diluted 1:10,000 and developed with the Western-Star chemiluminescent substrate. Immunoprecipitation was also per-formed with 2 \ufffdg of MSP5-specific MAb/ml and protein A/G agarose(Thermo Scientific), and the immunoprecipitate (IP) was electropho-resed, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with antibodies, and devel-oped as described above. Each polyclonal antibody and anti-MSP5 usedfor immunoprecipitation pulled down the respective target protein.In addition, immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with rab-bit anti-VirB9-1 IgG as described above, and the IPs were electrophoresedin a single large well, transferred to nitrocellulose, and strips were cut andprobed with 2 \ufffdg of mouse MAb specific for VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10,MSP2, MSP5, or B. bovis MSA1 (23/10.41, IgG2b) (22)/ml. Secondaryantibody was AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\ufffdIgM diluted 1:10,000.Blots were developed with Western-Star chemiluminescent substrate for30 min or longer.RESULTSRecombinant T4SS proteins. All proteins were expressed withtheir full-length, with the exception of VirB6-1 F1, for which thefirst fragment was used because the full-length protein did notexpress (Fig. 1). Some additional weak bands were observed (i.e.,for VirB4-2, VirB8-2, and VirB11). For VirB4-2, these reactedwith anti-HIS MAb on immunoblotting, suggesting they are de-graded protein fragments (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental mate-rial). Visualization of immunoblots of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, andrVirB10 probed with anti-FLAG MAb indicated that the purifiedproteins migrated at 50, 50, and 65 kDa, as well as at 100, 100, and130 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). The corresponding weak bands onCoomassie blue-stained gels (Fig. 2B) were excised for MS/MSanalysis, rVirB9-1 and rVirB9-2 were each identified in their re-spective 50- and 100-kDa bands, and VirB10 was identified inboth 65- and 130-kDa bands (Table 1). Because other A. marginaleproteins were not identified, this is consistent with the formationof homodimers by rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. The sameprocedure was followed with rVirB7 bands at 20 and 40 kDa (Fig.2); however, there was no evidence that rVirB7 dimerized. The20-kDa band was identified as VirB7, and the 40-kDa band wasidentified as E. coli thioredoxin 1 (Table 1). Although faint bandsmigrating at \ufffd140 kDa were observed for VirB9-1 and VirB9-2 onsome immunoblots (Fig. 2A), there were no corresponding pro-tein bands visible on the gel, even when 10 time more protein wasloaded (Fig. 2B), so these were not analyzed by MS/MS. These mayFIG 1 Purity of recombinant T4SS proteins. Recombinant T4SS proteins wereloaded at 1 \ufffdg/well, separated on 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, andstained with Coomassie blue dye.

(A)Recombinant proteins (1 \ufffdg) were transferred from a 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel to a nitrocellulose membrane that was probed with anti-His MAb(rVirB7) or anti-FLAG MAb (rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10) and devel-oped. Scanned images were rearranged and presented as shown. The results forVirB7 were obtained in a separate experiment.

In addition to the protein bands that were identified asdimers, products of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 that migratedbelow the dimeric and monomeric forms were visualized on boththe gels and Western blots. Because these bands react with anti-FLAG MAb, which is highly specific for this epitope, these bandslikely represent degradation products of the individual proteinsresulting in bands smaller than the monomers and dimers, as pre-viously observed for these proteins (33).IgG responses to T4SS proteins in OM vaccinees. All six OM-immunized cattle produced IgG against VirB9-1, VirB9-2, andVirB10, with VirB9-1 inducing the highest titer tested of at least10,000 (Table 2). Cattle 35113, 35141, 35160, 35280, and 35287produced strong IgG responses directed at VirB7 with titers of atleast 10,000. Cattle 35280 and 35287 also produced IgG againstVirB4-2. However, none of the animals produced detectable IgGresponses against VirB2, VirB4-1, VirB6-1 F1, VirB8-2, VirB11, orVirD4 compared to preimmunization sera.T-lymphocyte responses to T4SS proteins in OM vaccinees.Two-week T-cell lines enriched for CD4\ufffd T cells from the sixOM-immunized cattle were tested for antigen specific prolifera-tion to recombinant T4SS proteins (Table 3). VirB9-1, VirB9-2,and VirB10 were highly immunogenic for the majority of the an-imals. However, animals 35160 and 583 did not respond toVirB9-1, animals 35160 and 35280 did not respond to VirB9-2,and animal 35280 did not respond to VirB10. Animals 35160 and35287 had significant T-cell responses to VirB2, and animal 35160had a significant T-cell response to VirD4. Interestingly, 35160was the only animal that had T-cell responses to VirB6-1, and35287 was the only animal that responded to VirB4-2. Lastly, therewas no detectable T-cell response from any animal to VirB4-1,VirB7, VirB8-2 and VirB11 antigens. These results are represen-tative of three or more experiments.Selection of linked recognition candidates. Selection of T4SSprotein candidates that could undergo linked recognition wasbased on predicted surface localization, as well as induction of anIgG response, but not a significant CD4 T-cell response, in thesame individual. Based on previous results with A. phagocytophi-lum and A. marginale (2, 18, 42, 43, 61) and bioinformatic predic-tions for A. marginale (see Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the supplemen-tal material), VirB2, VirB6-1, VirB7, VirB8-2, VirB9-1, VirB9-2,and VirB10 are predicted to be localized on the exterior surface ofA. marginale. Therefore, the ability of any of these proteins toinduce IgG without a significant CD4 T-cell response would makeit a candidate for linked recognition and inclusion in future vac-cine trials, as surface exposed proteins could be blocked by neu-tralizing antibody. These candidates are VirB9-1 for animal 583(DRB3 RFLP type 8/23), VirB9-1, and VirB9-2 for animal 35160(3/16), VirB9-2 and VirB10 for animal 35280 (16/27), and VirB7for all animals except 583 (summarized in Table 4). These proteinswere therefore selected to identify protein partners within theT4SS that had T-cell epitopes recognized by these animals.Detecting the interactions of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10by far-Western blotting. Protein A-purified rabbit IgG againstrVirB7, rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10 was tested for antigenspecificity by immunoblotting with native OM and recombinantT4SS proteins (Fig. 3). In repeated assays, anti-VirB7 detected aband in the OM that was greater than the predicted native mass of\ufffd6 kDa (Fig. 3A). In contrast, IgG against rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, andrVirB10 recognized the native OM protein at the predicted mo-lecular weight and at a 2-fold-higher molecular weight (Fig. 3B toD). In addition, anti-VirB9-2 detected a fainter, narrow band at\ufffd140 kDa, which may represent a multimer of the native proteinor a multimer of VirB9-2 and another protein(s).

For rVirB9-1 (Fig. 3B), rVirB9-2 (Fig. 3C), and rVirB10(Fig. 3D) IgG bound specifically to its target protein and at a bandof approximately twice the molecular weight, which we showedare dimers (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Bands larger than the dimer thatare present in the immunizing protein detected by the IgGs againstVirB9-1 and VirB9-2 may represent multimers of the VirB9 pro-tein with other T4SS proteins, since it is known that the A. tume-faciens core-complex has 14 copies of VirB9 that interact with 14copies of VirB7 and 14 copies of VirB10 (17). Importantly, theIgGs did not bind to any other T4SS protein, showing that the IgGswere specific for the immunizing protein. An artifactual band of-ten observed in immunoblots with polyclonal rabbit antisera thatwas determined to be keratin (45) was observed with the anti-VirB9-2 antibody, which detects a diffuse band at \ufffd68 kDa andanother at \ufffd140 kDa (Fig. 3C). Because of the characteristic sizesand widths of these bands, they are assumed to be contaminatingkeratin monomers and dimers. These bands were only observedwith this antibody and detected in only certain recombinant pro-teins, but not in native OM. We were not able to eliminate thisnonspecific keratin band by lowering the amount of reducingagent in the sample buffer as suggested by others (30).The far-Western blotting strategy was performed as a screeningtool to determine which rT4SS proteins bind to rVirB7, rVirB9-1,rVirB9-2, and rVirB10 that could enable them to undergo linkedTABLE 4 Summary of IgG and T-cell responses to A. marginale T4SS proteins in six Holstein cattleaAntigenOM-immunized animalb:35113 (11/22) 35141 (22/24) 35160 (3/16) 35280 (16/27) 35287 (16/22) 583 (8/23)VirB2IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd \u2013 \ufffd \u2013VirB4-1IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013VirB4-2IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd \ufffd \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd \u2013VirB7IgG \ufffd* \ufffd* \ufffd* \ufffd* \ufffd* \u2013T cells \u2013* \u2013* \u2013* \u2013* \u2013* \u2013VirB6-1 F1IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd \u2013 \u2013 \u2013VirB8-2IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013VirB9-1IgG \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd* \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd*T cells \ufffd \ufffd \u2013* \ufffd \ufffd \u2013*VirB9-2IgG \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd* \ufffd* \u2013 \ufffdT cells \ufffd \ufffd \u2013* \u2013* \ufffd \ufffdVirB10IgG \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd* \ufffd \ufffdT cells \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \u2013* \ufffd \ufffdVirB11IgG \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013VirD4IgG \u2013 \ufffd \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013T cells \u2013 \u2013 \ufffd \u2013 \u2013 \u2013a The IgG responses from Table 2 and the T-cell responses from Table 3 are summarized.b DRB3 RFLP types are indicated in parentheses in the column subheadings.

The far-Western blots developed with anti-VirB7 failed to detect potential interacting proteins (data notshown), so proteins interacting with VirB7 were not pursuedfurther. However, the results indicate several interactions amongT4SS proteins. Recombinant VirB9-1 interacted with rVirB8-2 atthe correct molecular mass of 23 kDa; with rVirB9-2 at the pre-dicted mass of 46 kDa, as well as with a predicted dimer and withapparent degradation products; with rVirB10 at the predictedmass of 65 kDa, as well as with apparent degradation products;and with rMSP5 at the predicted mass of 28 kDa (Fig. 4A). Recom-binant VirB9-2 interacted with rVirB9-1 at the predicted mass of46 kDa, as well as with a predicted dimer and apparent degrada-tion products (Fig. 4B). Recombinant VirB10 interacted withrVirB4-1 at the predicted mass of 91 kDa, with rVirB8-2 at thepredicted mass of 23 kDa, with rVirB9-1 at the predicted mass of46 kDa, and with rVirD4 at the predicted mass of 93 kDa and twosmaller bands (Fig. 4C). The reactivity of degradation products ofthese proteins with anti-His MAb can be seen in Fig. S2 in thesupplemental material.Binding coefficients for VirB9-1 interactions. The bindingcoefficient for rVirB9-1 interaction with rVirB9-2 was 0.0173 \ufffd0.0034 \ufffdM and that for rVirB9-1 interaction with rVirB10 was0.0109 \ufffd 0.0094 \ufffdM (Fig. 5). The binding coefficients for thereverse of the interactions were also determined and found to besimilar (rVirB9-2 with rVirB9-1, KD \ufffd 0.0205 \ufffd 0.0173 \ufffdM; andrVirB10 with rVirB9-1, KD \ufffd 0.0135 \ufffd 0.0080 \ufffdM; see Fig. S4 inthe supplemental material), whereas there was no binding de-tected between VirB9-2 and VirB10 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemen-tal material). The graphed intensities of the spots that yielded theabove KD values all had a goodness of fit to the binding curveequation with at least 80% confidence (Fig. 5). These results indi-cate that rVirB9-1 has stronger binding to rVirB10 than torVirB9-2.Native VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 interactions deter-mined by immunoprecipitation. Because the anti-VirB7 anti-body did not consistently bind to a native protein of the predictedmolecular weight, we focused on using antibodies to VirB9-1,VirB9-2, and VirB10 to identify interacting native protein part-ners using immunoprecipitation of solubilized OM (Fig. 6).

The 60-kDa bands couldrepresent homodimers of these proteins, a heterodimer ofVirB9-1 and VirB9-2, or binding to another 30-kDa protein.VirB9-2 (Fig. 6B, lane 1), VirB10 (Fig. 6C, lane 1), and 19-kDaMSP5 (Fig. 6D, lane 1) were also detected in the VirB9-1 IP, butthe \ufffd37-kDa MSP2 was not (Fig. 6E, lane 1). The anti-VirB9-2 IPprobed with anti-VirB9-1 IgG also showed \ufffd30- and \ufffd60-kDabands (Fig. 6A, lane 2). VirB10 (Fig. 6C, lane 2), MSP5 (Fig. 6D,lane 2), and MSP2 (Fig. 6E, lane 2) were not detected in the anti-VirB9-2 IP. For the anti-VirB10 IP, a band with the predicted massfor VirB10 (49 kDa) was detected, along with an additional bandat \ufffd100 kDa (Fig. 6C, lanes 3 and 6). This 100-kDa band could bea homodimer of VirB10 or an interaction of VirB10 with anotherprotein(s). VirB9-1 was detected in this IP (Fig. 6A, lane 3), butVirB9-2 (Fig. 6B, lane 3), MSP5 (Fig. 6D, lane 3), and MSP2 (Fig.6E, lane 3) were not. Immunoprecipitation reactions were alsoalkylated to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds, electropho-resed, and probed with anti-VirB9-1, anti-VirB9-2, anti-VirB10,and anti-ACP. However, reduction and alkylation had little effecton the interactions or apparent homodimerization (see Fig. S5 inthe supplemental material), suggesting that the observed T4SSinteractions are not formed with disulfide linkages. The negativecontrol rabbit anti-ACP IgG immunoprecipitation did not pulldown any T4SS protein, MSP5, or MSP2 (Fig. 6A to E, lane 4).To confirm the interaction of native VirB9-1 with MSP5, im-munoprecipitation was performed with MAb against MSP5, andit was determined that MSP5 does interact with VirB9-1 (Fig. 6A,lane 5), but not with VirB9-2 or VirB10 (Fig. 6B and C, lane 5,respectively). Furthermore, the highly abundant MSP2 (34) wasnever identified in the T4SS IPs (Fig. 6E, lanes 1 to 5), supportingthe specificity of the detected T4SS interactions. Taken together,FIG 4 Far-Western blotting to detect interacting recombinant T4SS proteinswith specific targets. The indicated purified recombinant T4SS proteins (1 \ufffdg)were separated on 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to a nitrocel-lulose membrane, and incubated with 10 \ufffdg of target protein rVirB9-1 (A),rVirB9-2 (B), and rVirB10 (C). The interactions were detected with E. coli-adsorbed rabbit antisera (1:500) specific for VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10.Blots were developed with goat anti-rabbit IgG(H\ufffdL). Scanned images wererearranged and presented as shown. In panel A, the results for VirB11 andVirD4 were obtained from a separate experiment. An asterisk indicates aninteracting protein partner to the target protein with the following predictedmolecular masses: rVirB4-1 (90 kDa), rVirB4-2 (91 kDa), rVirB6-1 F1 (90kDa), rVirB8-2 (23 kDa), rVirB9-1 (46 kDa), rVirB9-2(46 kDa), rVirB10 (65kDa), rVirB11 (38 kDa), rVirD4 (93 kDa), and MSP5 (28 kDa).FIG 5 Single site saturation binding curves for the interactions of rVirB9-1with rVirB9-2 and rVirB10. Densitometry analysis was performed to evaluatethe interactions of rVirB9-1 with rVirB9-2 (A) and rVirB9-1 with rVirB10 (B)that were applied to dot blots at amounts up to 5 \ufffdg, allowed to interact with10 \ufffdg of rVirB9-1, probed with rabbit anti-VirB9-1 antiserum, and developed.Reactions were compared to the density of the reaction of rVirB9-1 to negativecontrol rMSA1. The data are graphically represented as concentration of theprotein on the spot versus spot intensity, and the curve was fit to a single sitebinding curve to yield the binding association constant. The graphs are repre-sentative of three independent experiments.Linked Recognition of A. marginale T4SS ProteinsJanuary 2012 Volume 80 Number 1 iai.asm.org 223http://iai.asm.orgour results show that VirB9-1 binds to VirB9-2, VirB10, andMSP5, VirB9-2 only interacts with VirB9-1, VirB10 only interactswith VirB9-1, and native MSP5 interacts only with VirB9-1.An additional confirmation to detect interactions was per-formed by following the same immunoprecipitation procedurewith rabbit anti-VirB9-1 IgG but using MAbs against VirB9-1,VirB9-2, VirB10, MSP2, MSP5, and MSA1 to probe the West-ern blot (Fig. 7). The anti-VirB9-1 IP contained 30-kDaVirB9-1, 30-kDa VirB9-2, 49-kDa VirB10, and 19-kDa MSP5but not negative control MSP2 or B. bovis MSA1 (Fig. 7A).There was no antibody reactivity with IPs using preimmunerabbit IgG (Fig. 7B). This result confirms that VirB9-1 interactswith VirB9-2, VirB10 and MSP5.Comparison of amino acid sequences for VirB9-1, VirB9-2,and VirB10 among A. marginale and A. centrale strains. Pre-dicted amino acid sequence alignments revealed that VirB9-1,VirB9-2, and VirB10 proteins are highly conserved across A. mar-ginale strains. For VirB9-1 the amino acid identity is 97 to 100%(with the exception of the Mississippi strain for which the VirB9-1sequence is incomplete), and for VirB9-2 and VirB10 the sequenceidentity is 100% (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Fur-FIG 6 Detection of native protein interactions of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10. Solubilized A. marginale OM proteins were immunoprecipitated with purifiedrabbit IgG against VirB9-1 (lane 1), VirB9-2 (lane 2), VirB10 (lane 3), negative control B. bovis ACP (lane 4), and an MAb specific for MSP5 (lane 5) as indicatedfor each lane. Solubilized OM were included (lane 6) for a size comparison. Immunoprecipitated pellets and OM were electrophoresed and transferred tonitrocellulose membranes. Detection of the interacting proteins was performed by Western blotting individual strips with purified rabbit IgG against VirB9-1(A), VirB9-2 (B), and VirB10 (C) and MAbs specific for MSP5 (D) and MSP2 (E), as indicated under each panel. The secondary antibody was Clear Blot-HRP(panels A to D and panel E, lane 5) or goat anti-mouse IgG\ufffdIgM (panel E, lanes 1 to 4 and 6). Scanned images were rearranged and presented as shown.

Solubilized OM proteins were immunoprecipitatedwith rabbit anti-ViB9-1 (A) or normal rabbit (B) IgG, and the pellets wereelectrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Strips were cutand probed with MAbs specific for VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10, MSP2, MSP5,and B. bovis MSA1, as indicated at the top of each lane. The secondary antibodywas goat anti-mouse IgG\ufffdIgM. Scanned images were rearranged and are pre-sented as shown. The predicted molecular masses for native proteins are indi-cated in parentheses: VirB9-1 (30 kDa), VirB9-2 (30 kDa), VirB10 (49 kDa),MSP2 (37 kDa), MSP5 (19 kDa), and B. bovis MSA1 (42 kDa).Morse et al.224 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunityhttp://iai.asm.orgthermore, comparison of sequence identities of these proteins tothose of the vaccine strain, A. centrale, also revealed a high degreeof conservation, which was 98 to 99% identity for VirB9-1 with allA. marginale strains (except Mississippi), 92% for VirB9-2, and93% for VirB10 for all A. marginale strains (see Fig. S6 in thesupplemental material). Because of this high degree of amino acidsequence identity, these T4SS proteins would be good candidatesfor inclusion in a cross-protective vaccine.DISCUSSIONThis study sought to identify A. marginale T4SS protein candi-dates for linked recognition that could be incorporated into avaccine. Linked recognition is a well-known rationale for design-ing vaccines against pathogens with capsular polysaccharide anti-gens, which on their own are poorly antigenic. Examples includevaccines for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneu-moniae, where T-dependent protein antigens are linked to theT-independent polysaccharide to achieve neutralizing antibodyresponses directed against the polysaccharide (26, 52). Immuni-zation studies using two or more associated proteins are also sug-gestive that linked recognition enhances protection against bacte-rial pathogens. For example, protective immunity was inducedwith bacterial membrane protein complexes or fusion proteins ofsurface exposed type III secretion system proteins of Yersinia pestis(6, 23). Association of proteins within the context of the mem-brane was also important for leptospiral outer membrane porinOmpL1 and lipoprotein LipL41 in protection studies (21).Consistent with previous results (32\u201334, 56) VirB9-1, VirB9-2,and VirB10 are highly immunogenic and in the present study werethe most immunogenic of the 11 A. marginale T4SS proteins ex-amined for cattle with diverse MHC class II haplotypes. We con-firmed that cattle with the DRB3 RFLP type 8/23 (animal 583 inthe present study and animal 04B91 [33, 56]) have an IgG re-sponse, but no T-cell response, to VirB9-1. This suggests that foranimals with this haplotype, T-cell help for IgG production isprovided through linked recognition by a different, but associatedprotein. In addition, we have new evidence that linked recognitionoccurs for cattle with the DRB3 RFLP type 3/16 to produce IgG toVirB9-1 and VirB9-2 (animal 35160), DRB3 RFLP type 16/27 toproduce IgG to VirB9-2 and VirB10 (animal 35280), and DRB3RFLP types 11/22, 22/24, 3/16, 16/27, and 16/22 to produce IgG toVirB7 (animals 35113, 35141, 35160, 35280, and 35287, respec-tively). All of these proteins are likely to be surface exposed, aspredicted by bioinformatics. Furthermore, these proteins wererecognized by the immune sera of infected animals (2, 56, 61), andVirB10 was identified in outer membrane complexes followingcross-linking with membrane-impermeable cross-linkers (43).Based on the criteria of predicted surface localization and patternof immune recognition by three animals and haplotypes that hadIgG but undetectable T-cell responses to one or two of these pro-teins, VirB7, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 were designated can-didates for linked recognition. We then focused on identifying theinteracting protein partners of VirB9 and VirB10 proteins withinthe T4SS.Far-Western blotting was used as an initial screening tool toidentify potential interacting T4SS proteins. The data suggest thatrecombinant VirB10 interacts with rVirB4-1, rVirB8-2, VirB9-1,and rVirD4, interactions that have also been observed with ho-mologous proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (3, 5, 15). Theinteractions of rVirB10 with rVirB4-1 and rVirD4, two putativeNTPases, have also been observed for Helicobacter pylori and Rick-ettsia sibrica (37, 58) and implicate VirB10 in substrate shuttling(11). The VirB4-1 gene is more conserved across the Rickettsialesthan VirB4-2, and VirB4-2 has more insertions and deletions, in-cluding those in the NTP-binding cleft, relative to other bacteria(19). This is consistent with the observed interaction of VirB10with VirB4-1 and not with VirB4-2. Recombinant VirB10 andrVirB9-1 both appear to interact with rVirB8-2, indicating thatVirB8-2 may also be part of the core complex of the T4SS appara-tus (15, 27). However, VirB8-2 was not of particular interest topursue because it was not antigenic for the OM vaccinees used inthe present study. The interaction of rVirB9-1 and rVirB9-2 hadnot been previously reported, because only bacteria in the familyAnaplasmatacae are known to express two full-length VirB9 pro-teins (19, 20). The interaction of rVirB9-1 with rMSP5 is interest-ing since none of the other proteins interacted with MSP5. How-ever, it is unknown if MSP5 has T-cell epitopes to stimulate T-cellhelp to VirB9-1 in 3/16 and 8/23 DRB3 RFLP-typed animals. Theinteractions of rVirB9 and rVirB10 proteins were confirmed fornative proteins in solubilized A. marginale OM using pulldownassays with polyclonal, monospecific antibodies and detectionwith both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. These interac-tions and the potential formation of homodimers are consistentwith what is known about the A. tumefaciens T4SS core complexstructure (13, 17). However, this is the first study to report inter-acting T4SS proteins of the A. marginale, as well as the first todocument interactions of the VirB9 and VirB10 proteins in theAnaplasmatacae.The immunogenicity of VirB9 and VirB10 proteins may beexplained by the lack of surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leadingto increased surface exposure of these proteins that form the outercap of the T4SS core complex (7, 17, 19, 20). Although Rickettsiaspp. synthesize LPS, the Anaplasmataceae do not (20). In agree-ment with our results and the observation that cattle infected withA. marginale have antibody to VirB9 and VirB10 proteins (2, 56,61), dogs infected with Ehrlichia canis were also serologically pos-itive for VirB9 (16). Thus, the T4SS VirB9 and VirB10 proteinsmay generally be good vaccine targets for the Anaplasmatacae.A combination of cellular and humoral immunity is likelyimportant for the control of anaplasmosis, and vaccine anti-gens should be highly conserved across multiple strains to en-sure cross-protective immunity. Furthermore, inclusion in avaccine of multiple linked proteins that are naturally associatedin the membrane of A. marginale will not only provide morethan one immunogenic protein but will offer the opportunityfor linked recognition. Immunization with several naturallyassociated, linked proteins could increase T-cell-dependentIgG responses upon infection in outbred populations that ex-press a broad repertoire of MHC class II molecules. Protectinga large population of genetically heterogeneous individuals re-quires understanding of MHC class II-restricted epitope pre-sentation. The naturally associated T4SS protein complex thatspans the inner and outer membrane provides a model systemto examine the importance of membrane protein-protein in-teractions in stimulating protective immunity. Thus, a proteincomplex made up of highly conserved VirB9-1, VirB9-2, andVirB10 will be tested as a vaccine in a future study to protectMHC haplotype-defined cattle against A. marginale.Linked Recognition of A. marginale T4SS ProteinsJanuary 2012 Volume 80 Number 1 iai.asm.org 225http://iai.asm.orgACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe technical assistance of Shelley Whidbee, Beverly Hunter, Bruce Ma-thison, Nishant Dwivedi, and Emma Karel is appreciated.
