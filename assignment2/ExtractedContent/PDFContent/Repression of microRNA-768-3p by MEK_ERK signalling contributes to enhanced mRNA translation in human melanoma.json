"Repression of microRNA-768-3p by MEK&sol;ERK signalling contributes to enhanced mRNA translation in human melanomaORIGINAL ARTICLERepression of microRNA-768-3p by MEK/ERK signallingcontributes to enhanced mRNA translation in human melanomaCC Jiang1,2, A Croft1,3, H-Y Tseng1,2, ST Guo4, L Jin5, P Hersey5 and XD Zhang1,2,4Increased global protein synthesis and selective translation of mRNAs encoding proteins contributing to malignancy is common incancer cells. This is often associated with elevated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 (eIF4E), the rate-limitingfactor of cap-dependent translation initiation. We report here that in human melanoma downregulation of miR-768-3p as a resultof activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has animportant role in the upregulation of eIF4E and enhancement in protein synthesis. Melanoma cells displayed increased nascentprotein production and elevated eIF4E expression, which was associated with the downregulation of miR-768-3p that waspredicted to target the 30-untranslated region of the eIF4E mRNA. Overexpression of miR-768-3p led to the downregulation of theendogenous eIF4E protein, reduction in nascent protein synthesis and inhibition of cell survival and proliferation. These effectswere efficiently reversed when eIF4E was co-overexpressed in melanoma cells. On the other hand, introduction of anti-miR-768-3pinto melanocytes upregulated endogenous eIF4E protein expression and increased global protein synthesis. Downregulation ofmiR-768-3p appeared to be mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, in that treatment of BRAFV600E melanoma cells withthe mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 or exposure of either BRAFV600E or wild-type BRAF melanoma cells to the MEK inhibitor U0126resulted in the upregulation of miR-768-3p and inhibition of nascent protein synthesis. This inhibition was partially blocked in cellscointroduced with anti-miR-768-3p. Significantly, miR-768-3p was similarly downregulated, which was inversely associated with theexpression levels of eIF4E in fresh melanoma isolates. Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-768-3p andsubsequent upregulation of eIF4E as an important mechanism in addition to phosphorylation of eIF4E responsible for MEK/ERK-mediated enhancement of protein synthesis in melanoma.Oncogene (2014) 33, 2577\u20132588; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.237; published online 17 June 2013Keywords: miR-768-3p; eIF4E; mRNA translation; melanoma; RAF/MEK/ERKINTRODUCTIONCancer cells require increased protein production to sustain theirmalignant characteristics such as enhanced survival and prolifera-tion.1\u20134 The rate of mRNA translation has an important role inregulating protein expression and is primarily controlled at thestage of translation initiation.1\u20134 Initiation of translation of mostmRNAs is mediated by the cap-dependent mechanism, whereascap-independent initiation is involved in the translation of asubset of mRNAs, especially under cellular stress conditions.1,3Cap-dependent translation initiation is governed by the eukaryoticinitiation factor (eIF) 4F (eIF4F) complex that consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A and the scaffoldingprotein eIF4G.1\u20134 Among them, eIF4E is the rate-limitingfactor that potentially influences the expression of almost everyprotein in cells.1,5,6The activity of eIF4E is regulated by its availability that is controlledby the eIF4E inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs), in particular, 4E-BP1.1,5,6 Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 shares the same binding motifwith eIF4G and thus competes with eIF4G for binding to andsequestering eIF4E.1,5,6 In addition, phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209 upon binding to eIF4G by mitogen-activated protein kinasesignal-integrating kinase 1 (MNK1) and MNK2 enhances itsactivity.5,7,8 Importantly, overexpression of eIF4E promotes cellulartransformation and tumourigenesis.9\u201311 This is associated withincreased translation of various mRNAs encoding cancer-promotingproteins.1,10\u201312 Indeed, eIF4E is expressed at increased levels in manytypes of cancers, such as those of the breast and colon,13\u201315 which isoften associated with disease progression and poor prognosis ofpatients.1,13\u201315 However, the mechanism(s) responsible for theupregulation of eIF4E in cancer cells remains elusive.MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate gene expression in a sequence-specificmanner through binding to 30-untranslated regions (UTRs) of targetmRNAs, either targeting the transcripts for degradation or blockingtheir translation.16,17 They can also inhibit translation by directlytargeting the eIF4F complex.18,19 The expression of miRs is frequentlyderegulated in cancer cells and many miRs are oncogenic or tumoursuppressive.17,20 In particular, a number of miRs such as miR-221/222and miR-149* are known to regulate melanoma cell survival orproliferation.21\u201325 Diverse mechanisms are involved in the regulationof miR expression in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. Theseinclude genomic alterations, epigenetic changes and transcriptionfactor-mediated transactivation or repression.16,26,27A characteristic of human melanoma is oncogenic activation ofthe mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular1Priority Research Centre for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; 2School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW,Australia; 3Oncology and Immunology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, Australia; 4Department of Molecular Biology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Institute,Taiyuan, Shanxi, People\u2019s Republic of China and 5Kolling Institute for Medical Research, University of Sydney, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.

We demonstrate here that MEK/ERK-mediated upregulation of eIF4E is due to its inhibitory effect onthe expression of miR-768-3p. The latter targets eIF4E and iscommonly downregulated in melanoma cells.RESULTSeIF4E is upregulated in melanoma cellsIncreased mRNA translation has an important role in thepathogenesis of cancer.1\u20134 In line with this, the magnitude ofnascent protein synthesis appeared significantly increased incultured melanoma cells compared with melanocytes (Figures 1aand b). Similarly, the relative amount of polysome-associatedmRNA in melanoma cells was also increased (Figure 1c). This wasassociated with increased expression and phosphorylation of theeIF4E protein (Figures 1d and e). The elevated levels of proteinproduction and eIF4E expression and phosphorylation in mela-noma cells compared with melanocytes was not due to thedifferences in culture conditions, in that Mel-RM and Mel-CV cellsgrown in melanocyte culture medium displayed even furtherincreases, albeit moderately, in protein synthesis and eIF4Eexpression and phosphorylation. In contrast, when melanocyteswere switched to melanoma cell culture medium, the levels ofprotein synthesis and eIF4E expression and phosphorylation werereduced (Supplementary Figure 1).The role of eIF4E in increased protein synthesis in melanomacells is confirmed by small RNA interference (siRNA) knockdown ofeIF4E, which caused marked reduction in nascent proteinsynthesis in Mel-CV cells (Figures 1f and g). However, it displayedless pronounced effect in Mel-RM cells. This was conceivably dueto the residual eIF4E protein that might remain adequate to drivemRNA translation as the endogenous eIF4E inhibitor 4E-BP1 wasalso downregulated when eIF4E was knocked down in the cells(Figure 1f).32 Nonetheless, knockdown of eIF4E rendered Mel-RMcells more sensitive to 4EGI-1, a small molecule that inhibits theinteraction between eIF4E and eIF4G (Figure 1h).33 Collectively,these results indicate that mRNA translation is enhanced, which isat least, in part, due to the upregulation of eIF4E, in melanomacells.Contrary to itsB6-fold increases at the protein level (Figure 1e),the eIF4E transcript was elevated o2-folds and displayedcomparable turnover rates in melanoma cells compared withmelanocytes (Figures 2a and b). Moreover, the half-life time of theeIF4E protein did not appear to prolong in melanoma cells(Figures 2c and d). These data suggest that translationalupregulation may have an important role in increased expressionof eIF4E in melanoma cells.MiR-768-3p is downregulated in melanoma cellsWe sought to determine if miRNAs that commonly targettranscripts to block their translation are involved in the regulationof eIF4E by comparing miRNA expression profiles betweenMel-RM and Mel-CV melanoma cell lines and HEMn-MP andHEMn-DP melanocyte lines using TaqMan low-density array(Applied Biosystems, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia). Among miRNAsthat were differentially expressed, a decrease in miR-768-3p,whose \u2018seed\u2019 region matched perfectly to a region (nucleotides2645\u20132652) at the 30-UTR of the eIF4E mRNA, in melanoma cellswas one of the most pronounced ( Genes-to-System Breast CancerDatabase: http://www.itb.cnr.it/breastcancer//index.htm) (Figures3a and b and Supplementary Table 1). This was subsequentlyconfirmed in 10 melanoma cell lines (Figure 3c). In contrast, othermiRNAs that are predicted to target eIF4E (MiRanda (http://www.microrna.org) and Target Scan (http://www.targetscan.org))such as miR-150b and miR-382 did not significantly alter inexpression in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes(Supplementary Table 1). Of importance, miR-768-3p wasexpressed at reduced levels in 48/50 of metastatic melanomaisolates relative to primary melanocytes (Figure 3d), suggestingthat inhibition of miR-768-3p expression may have functionalsignificance in melanoma biology in vivo.Figure 1.

These results indicate that thisRNA is indeed processed into a mature miR (miR-768-3p) inmelanoma cells.36To verify that miR-768-3p targets eIF4E, we introducedluciferase reporter plasmids of the 30-UTR of eIF4E into Mel-RMcells and HEMn-MP melanocytes (Figure 4b and SupplementaryFigure 2). The reporter activity was markedly suppressed by thepresence of the 30-UTR of eIF4E in HEMn-MP, and to a lesser extentin Mel-RM cells, which was however reversed when the 30-UTR wasmutated (Figure 4b), suggesting that the 30-UTR of eIF4E wasinhibited by endogenous miR-768-3p. In support, cointroductionof anti-miR-768-3p into Mel-RM and HEMn-MP cells increased(Figure 4c), whereas the addition of miR-768-3p mimics furtherreduced the reporter activity (Figure 4d). Therefore, miR-768-3ptargets the 30-UTR of eIF4E in both melanoma cells andmelanocytes. The fragment of DNA cloned into luciferase reporterplasmids was indeed present at the endogenous 30-UTR of eIF4E inmiR-768-3p regulates eIF4E in melanomaCC Jiang et al2579& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2014) 2577 \u2013 2588Mel-RM and HEMn-MP cells as verified by polymerase chainreaction (PCR) analysis (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).Introduction of miR-768-3p mimics into Mel-RM cells down-regulated the endogenous eIF4E protein levels, whereas intro-duction of anti-miR-768-3p into HEMn-MP resulted in an increasein the eIF4E protein expression (Figure 4e). These resultssubstantiate that eIF4E is a bona fide target of miR-768-3p thatis downregulated in melanoma cells. The endogenous levels ofanother two predicted miR-768-3p targets, Bcl-2 and ATF6, werenot affected by the introduction of miR-768-3p mimics or anti-miR-768-3p (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting that suppres-sion of eIF4E by miR-768-3p is highly selective in melanoma cells.We also examined representative fresh melanoma isolatessampled by relatively low (n\u00bc 3), intermediate (n\u00bc 3) and high(n\u00bc 3) levels of miR-768-3p for the expression of eIF4E. The resultsshowed that melanomas with low miR-768-3p expressiondisplayed relatively high levels of eIF4E, whereas intermediateand high miR-768-3p expression associated with progressively lesseIF4E (Figure 4f). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of miR-768-3p oneIF4E in vivo is in accordance with the regulatory model identifiedin vitro (Figures 4c\u2013f).Downregulation of miR-768-3p contributes to increased nascentprotein synthesisHaving established the role of miR-768-3p in the suppression ofeIF4E, we examined whether it is involved in increased nascentprotein synthesis in melanoma cells. Introduction of miR-768-3pinto Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells led to decreased global proteinproduction (Figure 5a), which recapitulated the effect of knock-down of eIF4E (Figure 1g). In contrast, introduction of anti-miR-768-3p into HEMn-MP melanocytes resulted in increasednascent protein synthesis, which could be abolished by thecointroduction of eIF4E siRNA (Figures 5b and c). These resultsindicate that downregulation of miR-768-3p has an important rolein increased protein synthesis in melanoma cells through theupregulation of eIF4E.MiR-768-3p is responsive to the MEK/ERK pathwayThe MEK/ERK pathway that has an important role in the regulationof mRNA translation is constitutively activated in the majority ofmelanomas.28,29 We therefore examined whether miR-768-3p isinvolved in MEK/ERK-mediated regulation of protein synthesisin melanoma cells. Comparison of miRNA expression profiles inMel-CV (BRAFV600E) cells before and after treatment with themutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 showed that an increase inmiR-768-3p (B8-fold) was among the most significant changesin miRNA expression (Figure 6a and Supplementary Table 2). Thiswas confirmed in a panel of BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines(Figure 6b). Similarly, treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126caused increases in miR-768-3p in both BRAFV600E and wild-typeBRAF melanoma cell lines (Figure 6c). These results suggest thatthe MEK/ERK pathway has an important role in the suppression ofmiR-768-3p in melanoma cells.PLX4720 inhibited nascent protein production in BRAFV600Emelanoma cells, whereas U0126 in both BRAFV600E and wild-typeBRAF melanoma cells (Figure 6d). However, this inhibition waspartially reversed in cells introduced with anti-miR-768-3p(Figure 6e), which in part recapitulated the inhibitory effect onprotein synthesis afforded by knockdown of eIF4E (Figures 1g and6f), indicating that suppression of miR-768-3p and subsequentupregulation of eIF4E is involved in enhancement of mRNAtranslation mediated by MEK/ERK. Taken together, results from theabove studies identify a novel MEK/ERK-dependent, miR-768-3p-mediated signalling pathway that contributes to increasedFigure 2. The increase in eIF4E expression in melanoma cells may be mediated by translational upregulation.

As anticipated,PLX4720 downregulated the levels of phosphorylated eIF4E inMel-CV (BRAFV600E) cells, whereas U0126 in both Mel-CV andMel-RM (wild-type BRAF) cells (Figure 6g). However, the kinetics ofinhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation by PLX4720 and U0126 wasmore rapid than their inhibitory effects on the expression of eIF4E.Therefore, activation of MEK/ERK promotes mRNA translation byimpinging on both eIF4E expression and its phosphorylation in abiphasic manner.MiR-768-3p inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and survivalAlthough introduction of miR-768-3p mimics, alike knockdown ofeIF4E, triggered apoptosis in a proportion of Mel-RM and Mel-CVcells (Figures 7a\u2013c), inhibition of cell proliferation appeared to bethe predominant consequence as shown in 5-bromo-20-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation and clonogenic assays (Figure 7d). Inaddition, cointroduction of miR-768-3p mimics and eIF4E siRNAfurther enhanced inhibition of cell survival and proliferation(Figure 7e). On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of miR-768-3pon cell proliferation was abolished in Mel-RM and Mel-CV cellsoverexpressing eIF4E (Figure 7f). Therefore, downregulation ofmiR-768-3p contributes to melanoma cell survival and prolifera-tion by impinging on the expression of eIF4E.To exclude possible off-target effects of the massive increase (amore than 15 000-fold increase in Mel-RM cells) in miR-768-3pexpression, resulting from the introduction of miR-768-3p mimics,we introduced an miR-768-3p precursor-expressing construct intoMel-RM and Mel-CV cells. This led to a 24- and 34-fold increasein miR-768-3p in Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells, respectively(Supplementary Figure 5). Introduction of the construct causedapoptosis and inhibition of proliferation to a similar extent tothat triggered by miR-768-3p mimics (Supplementary Figure 5),suggesting that the effect of miR-768-3p on melanoma cellsurvival and proliferation is specific.To further validate the role of miR-768-3p in melanoma cellsurvival and proliferation, we introduced miR-768-3p mimics intotwo fresh metastatic melanoma isolates, Mel-JR and Mel-BE.As shown in Figure 7g, introduction of miR-768-3p mimics alsoresulted in reduced proliferation rates of these fresh melanomaisolates, which may reflect more closely melanoma cell responsesto altered miR-768-3p expression in vivo.Figure 3.

Thiswas associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and survival.Our results also reveal that downregulation of miR-768-3p inmelanoma cells is mediated by activation of the MEK/ERKpathway.Cancer cells require greater protein synthesis output to sustaintheir malignancy.1\u20134 Consistent with this, we found that globalmRNA translation and nascent protein production were increasedin melanoma cells compared with melanocytes. Although we didnot examine the translation rate of any particular mRNA,it is conceivable that translation of mRNAs encoding cancer-promoting proteins are accelerated in melanoma cells, as theincrease in global protein synthesis is associated with an increasein the expression of eIF4E. While the latter is known to have thepotential to mediate translation of almost every mRNA, itsoverexpression preferentially stimulates synthesis of a number ofproteins that are associated with cancers such as c-MYC, cyclin-D1and VEGF.1,38\u201340 mRNAs encoding these proteins have highlystructured 50-UTRs, which result in their translation repressionunder normal conditions.1,41 Nevertheless, these mRNAs respondmore efficiently to elevated eIF4E.1,38 Indeed, c-MYC, cyclin-D1 andmiR-768-3p regulates eIF4E in melanomaCC Jiang et al2582Oncogene (2014) 2577 \u2013 2588 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers LimitedVEGF have all been reported to increase in expression inmelanoma compared with nevus tissues.38\u201340In experimental systems, overexpression of eIF4E promotescancer development and progression, whereas inhibition ofeIF4E suppresses malignancy.42,43 Consistently, the expression ofeIF4E is increased in many types of cancers including melanomain vivo,13\u201315,44 which is commonly correlated with diseaseprogression and poor prognosis of patients, and is associatedwith resistance to therapeutic agents.13\u201315,44 However, although itis well known that the eIF4E activity is regulated by its availabilityand phosphorylation, the mechanisms responsible for itsupregulation remain less understood. We found in this studythat the eIF4E protein was increased to a noticeably greaterdegree than its transcript in melanoma cells compared withmelanocytes (B6 vsB1.6 times), and that the stability of theprotein and transcript remained similar between the two types ofcells, suggesting that the increase in eIF4E is primarily mediatedby translational regulation. We were thus promoted to explorethe potential role of miRs in the regulation of eIF4E expressionand identified downregulation of miR-768-3p as an importantmechanism responsible for the upregulation of eIF4E inmelanoma cells.As miR-768-3p is located within the sequence of the smallnucleolar RNA HBII-239,34 its existence as an miR has beenchallenged and its entry has been removed from miRBASE.However, we found that miR-768-3p was associated with Agoproteins, a core component of the RNA-induced silencingcomplex, to the same extent as miR-221, a well-established miRthat is increased in melanoma cells, indicating that miR-768-3ppossesses the characteristics of a functional miR in melanomacells.36 In support, it has been recently reported that miRs couldbe generated by small nucleolar RNA.35 It is conceivable thatFigure 4.

Targeting eIF4E by miR-768-3p appeared to be highly selective,in that the expression of Bcl-2 and ATF6, both of which are predictedtargets of miR-768-3p, did not respond to overexpression orinhibition of miR-768-3p. Regulation of target expression by miRsis known to be tissue- and cell type-specific.17The expression of miRs can be regulated by diverse mechanisms.These include genetic alterations, epigenetic changes and transcrip-tion factor-mediated transactivation or repression.17,20 Of interest,many miRs are associated with signalling pathways important for thepathogenesis of melanoma. For example, miR-221/222 has beenidentified as regulators of c-KIT, whereas miR-137 and miR-148 asregulators of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor.21,45,46 Inparticular, it has been recently reported that a number of miRs suchas miR-193a, miR-338 and miR-768-3p are subjected to regulation byoncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signalling in melanoma.30,31 Ourfinding that suppression of miR-768-3p by MEK/ERK contributes toenhanced mRNA translation through the upregulation of eIF4Eindicates that miR-768-3p is a build-in component of the MEK/ERKpathway in melanoma cells. Therefore, activation of MEK/ERKsignalling enhances protein synthesis not only by phosphorylatingeIF4E vial activation of MNK1 and MNK21\u20134,7 but also through theupregulation of eIF4E expression.Of note, miR-768-3p is embedded within intron 12 of thehuman gene encoding adaptor-related protein complex 1, gamma 1subunit (AP1G1),47 which was also increased by inhibition ofMEK (Supplementary Figure 6), suggesting that miR-768-3p maybe regulated along with the AP1G1 gene in response to MEK/ERKsignalling. However, the exact mechanism involved and thefunctional significance of the regulation of APIG1 by MEK/ERKremains to be investigated. APIG1 is known to have an importantrole in protein transportation mediated by clathrin-coatedvesicles.48The functional significance of miR-768-3p in melanoma wasdemonstrated by inhibition of cell survival and proliferation with itsoverexpression, which was also echoed by its downregulation infresh melanoma isolates and the negative association between itsexpression levels and the levels of eIF4E. Multiple moleculesconceivably contribute to the regulation of melanoma cell survivaland proliferation by miR-768-3p, such as c-MYC and cyclin D1, whichare sensitive to changes in the expression levels of eIF4E.33,38\u201341Targeting eIF4E is in development for clinical use in the treatment ofcancer.3,49 Our results suggest that restoration of the expression ofmiR-768-3p may be a useful alternative strategy for inhibition ofeIF4E in melanoma. As a precedent, replacement therapy has beenshown to be efficacious in a mouse model of colon cancer for miR-145 and miR-33a.50 With continuing investigations into in vivodelivery systems for miRs, this approach is likely to be achievable.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culture and reagentsThe human melanoma cell lines used have been described previously and aresummarized in Supplementary Table 3.51 They were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019smodified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 5% foetal calf serum (CommonwealthSerum Laboratories, Melbourne, VIC, Australia).
