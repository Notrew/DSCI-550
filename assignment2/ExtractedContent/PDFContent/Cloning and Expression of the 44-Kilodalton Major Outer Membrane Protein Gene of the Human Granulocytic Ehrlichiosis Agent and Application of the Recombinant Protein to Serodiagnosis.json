A gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced.Southern blot results revealed the existence of multigenes homologous to the P44 gene in the genome of theHGE agent. The recombinant 44-kDa protein (rP44) was expressed by using expression vector pET30a. Thereactivity of the affinity-purified rP44 was evaluated by Western immunoblot analysis and dot blot immuno-assay. Western immunoblot analysis showed that mouse anti-rP44 serum reacted with 44- to 42-kDa proteinsin six different HGE agent strains tested except strain 2, in which three proteins of 42, 40, and 38 kDa wererecognized. Eleven HGE patient serum samples, a horse anti-HGE serum, and a horse anti-Ehrlichia equiserum recognized the rP44 protein. This suggests that rP44 is an HGE-E. equi group-specific antigen. Neitherhuman anti-Ehrlichia chaffeensis serum nor rabbit anti-Borrelia burgdorferi serum reacted with rP44. Sera fromtwo patients coinfected with the HGE agent and B. burgdorferi reacted positively with rP44 and the HGE agent.Sera from 20 HGE patients with indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:2,560 gavedistinct positive reactions in a dot immunoblot assay. There was a positive correlation between the colordensities of the dot reactions and the IFA titers when greater than 50 ng of recombinant antigen per dot wasused. The use of the affinity-purified rP44 protein as antigen would provide a more specific, consistent, andsimpler serodiagnosis for HGE than the use of whole infected cells or purified HGE agents.Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), an emerging infec-tious disease in humans, is increasingly being recognized in theUnited States (6, 9, 11). Serological and PCR studies suggestthat HGE infection also exists in Europe (5, 7, 23, 28). Theetiologic agent of HGE is an obligate intracellular bacteriumthat has been identified as a member of the family Rickettsi-aceae and is closely related to the Ehrlichia equi-Ehrlichiaphagocytophila group on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencecomparison (9). It has been successfully propagated in a con-tinuous promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60 (14, 26). HGEinfection is characterized by the presence of ehrlichial inclu-sions called morulae in human or animal peripheral bloodgranulocytes. Recently, evidence of coinfection with Borreliaburgdorferi and the HGE agent was obtained by isolation ofboth organisms from the same patient (19). Although severallaboratories have used indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA)testing (6, 26, 31), acute-phase blood smear (6), nested PCR(9, 13, 31), and culture isolation (14, 26, 31) for diagnosis ofHGE, each of these diagnostic tests has both advantages anddisadvantages. IFA testing using the HGE agent or E. equi-infected cells has been the most widely used method for theserodiagnosis of ehrlichiosis. The IFA test is the most sensitivemethod when both acute- and convalescent-phase sera arebeing tested (31). However, it requires a tissue culture systemfor preparation of HGE agent-infected cell antigen slides, afluorescent microscope, and trained persons especially forevaluation of the serum reactivity to the antigen on the slide.Although antisera against various Ehrlichia species other thanE. equi and E. phagocytophila did not react with the HGE agent(26), cross-reactivity between the HGE agent and Ehrlichiachaffeensis was reported in previous studies (1, 6, 26). Thiscross-reactivity is probably caused by common antigenic com-ponents possessed by these two organisms. The nested PCRappears to be the best test for the early diagnosis of HGE (13,31). However, the nested PCR requires a thermocycler andtrained personnel and the reagents are relatively expensive.The HGE agent has been directly isolated and stably cultivatedfrom blood specimens of human patients (14, 26). In our pre-vious investigation (31), four new HGE agent isolates (8% ofthe total examined) were obtained from 53 blood specimens.The sensitivity of culture isolation in diagnosis seems to berelatively lower than those of the IFA test (23% positive of thetotal examined) and the nested PCR (13% positive of the totalexamined). Moreover, it requires serologic evidence, PCR, or16S rRNA gene sequence for confirmation of the identityof new isolates (31). Therefore, a convenient and sensitivemethod with high specificity for the diagnosis of HGE infectionis still desirable. It has been found that the host humoralimmune response in HGE infection is mainly directed against44- and 42-kDa proteins of the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). Westernblot analysis showed that 44- or 42-kDa proteins in differentHGE isolates were recognized by various sera from HGE pa-tients and an experimentally infected horse, indicating thecross-reactivity of major antigens among the different isolatesof the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). In the present study, the gene ofthe major surface 44-kDa protein (P44) of the HGE agent wascloned and sequenced and the partial gene which codes for theantigenic epitopes was overexpressed. Affinity-purified recom-binant P44 (rP44) was used as a testing antigen in Western* Corresponding author.

HGE agent isolates 2, 3, 6, 11, and 13 from patients inNew York State and USG isolate from the tick kindly provided by R. Coughlin(Cambridge Bio-Tech, Worcester, Mass.) were cultivated in HL-60 cells (11, 26,31). E. chaffeensis Arkansas was cultivated in the DH82 dog macrophage cell line(25). The organisms were purified by the Sephacryl S-1000 chromatographymethod described by Rikihisa et al. (24). B. burgdorferi HBH-1 and rabbit anti-B.burgdorferi HBH-1 were provided by Karim Hechemy, New York State Depart-ment of Health (Albany, N.Y.). All HGE patient serum samples, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13,21, and 22, were collected from patients at the Westchester County MedicalCenter in New York State. The diagnosis of HGE was confirmed by using PCR,IFA testing, and culture isolation as previously described (31). Among theseserum samples, samples 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, and 13 had been characterized by usingWestern immunoblot analysis in a previous study (31). Patient serum samples21-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 were collected at different stages of illness (25 July 1995,first acute stage; 24 August 1995, convalescent stage; 5 October 1995, 13 June1996, and 17 July 1997, second acute stage), respectively, from patient 21, whowas suspected of being reinfected with the HGE agent. Horse anti-HGE andhorse anti-E. equi sera were kindly provided by J. Madigan, University of Cali-fornia, Davis (18). Human anti-E. chaffeensis serum was kindly provided by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., and previously char-acterized by Western blotting (25). The sera from patients with Lyme borreliosisand coinfection with B. burgdorferi and HGE agent were also collected frompatients seen at the Westchester County Medical Center in New York State. Theprocedure of evaluation for B. burgdorferi infection was performed as previouslydescribed (19). The motile spirochetes visualized in blood or biopsy specimens oferythema migrans lesions by fluorescence microscopy were confirmed to be B.burgdorferi with a PCR using primers IS1 and IS2. Serum antibodies to B.burgdorferi were assayed by an immunoglobulin M (IgM)-IgG enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELA Lyme Stat; Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, Md.) inaccordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Construction and immunoscreening of the HGE agent gene library. GenomicDNA of the HGE agent H2 strain (isolate 13) was isolated from purified ehrli-chial organisms by lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pronase digestion,phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation in accordance with theprocedure of Ohashi et al. (20). Purified genomic DNA was completely digestedwith 20 U of EcoRI at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and then ligated into the lZAPII vector. Allprocedures were carried out with a lZAPII/EcoRI/CIAP cloning kit (Stratagene,La Jolla, Calif.) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, thegene library was constructed by infecting Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF9 withthe recombinant phage. Clones expressing ehrlichial proteins were identified byusing horse anti-HGE serum (18) (kindly provided by J. Madigan), which hadbeen preabsorbed with E. coli lysate. Positive recombinant pBluescript phage-mids were excised from the lZAPII phages in the presence of helper phage f1and used to transform E. coli SOLR cells (Stratagene). All of the positive cloneswere analyzed by Western blotting with the horse anti-HGE agent serum. Phage-mid purification, restriction enzyme digestion, and gel electrophoresis were car-ried out as described by Sambrook et al. (27).DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was determined by a dideoxy chaintermination method with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) model 373DNA sequencer. DNA sequencing was performed by a primer-walking methodusing synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Translation of the nucleotide se-quence and alignment of the amino acid sequence were done by using DNASIScomputer software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan).A homology search was done with the GenBank (National Center for Biotech-nology Information, Bethesda, Md.) database by using the local alignment searchtool (3) software in the BLAST network service (National Center for Biotech-nology Information). The GenBank accession number of the P44 gene isAF059181.Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the outer membraneproteins of the HGE agent. An outer membrane protein fraction from thepurified the HGE agent was prepared by the Sarkosyl extraction method asdescribed previously (20, 31). Proteins in the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet preparedfrom 700 mg of purified HGE agent organisms were separated by SDS\u201310%polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrophoretically transferredto a ProBlot membrane (Applied Biosystems) in 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-sulfonic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 10% methanol (pH 11) at 300 mA for4 to 5 h by use of a Bio-Rad (Hercules, Calif.) transblot cell, and the sheet wasstained with 1% amido black in 42% methanol\u201317% acetic acid. The proteinband areas were cut out, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of theproteins on the strips were analyzed by use of an Applied Biosystems model470A protein sequencer.Overexpression of the 44-kDa major outer membrane protein of the HGEagent. To effectively overexpress antigenic epitopes of rP44, the deduced aminoacid sequences based on the sequences of plasmid pHGE1221, which was posi-tive by immunoscreening and contained an open reading frame (ORF) encodingthe proposed P44, were analyzed with DNASTAR (Madison, Wis.) computersoftware. Several motifs with a high antigenic index and a probability of surfaceexposure were found in the NH2-terminal portion. Therefore, the primers weredesigned to amplify the DNA sequence encoding a 219-amino-acid polypeptidefrom the NH2 terminus including 8 amino acid residues of signal peptide andwere prepared by BioServe (Laurel, Md.). The 59 oligonucleotide primer consistsof the DNA sequence coding for the NH2-terminal region of the HGE agent P44and the NcoI restriction sites (underlined) (59-CGCCATGGCTGGGAGTGATGTCA-39), and the 39 oligonucleotide primers consist of the DNA sequencecoding for the amino acids from positions 243 to 247 with the additions of a stopcodon (TAG; in boldface type) and a EcoRI restriction site (underlined) (59-GCGAATTCTACGCACTACCATTACTCA-39) (Fig. 1). PCR amplification wascarried out with a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler (model 480) by usingstandard procedures. The 657-bp amplified product containing approximatelyhalf of the P44 gene was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into dephos-phorylated NcoI- and EcoRI-digested pET30a expression vector (Novagen, Inc.,Madison, Wis.). The recombinant plasmid was designated pEP44. E. coli Nov-aBlue (Novagen) was transformed with recombinant pET30a. A plasmid prep-aration of pEP44 from transformed NovaBlue was then used to transform E. coliBL21(DE3)/pLysS. The induction of the recombinant protein was performed bya procedure described elsewhere (17). The purification of rP44 protein wasperformed by using the His-Bind buffer kit (Novagen) in accordance with themanufacturer\u2019s instruction.Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA (200 ng) extracted from the purifiedHGE agent strain HZ (26) was completely digested with 20 U of restrictionendonucleases at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, electrophoresed, and transferred to a Hybond-N1nylon membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) by a standard method (27).The 1.2-kb P44 gene fragment generated by PCR from the clone pHGE1221 waslabeled with [a-32P]dATP by the random primer method using a kit (BoehringerMannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), and the labeled fragment was used as a DNAprobe. Hybridization was performed at 60\u00b0C in rapid hybridization buffer (Am-ersham) for 16 h. The nylon sheet was washed in 0.13 SSC (13 SSC is 0.15 MNaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate)\u20131% SDS at 55\u00b0C, and hybridized probes wereexposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham) at 280\u00b0C.Preparation of hyperimmune anti-rP44 polyclonal antiserum. Hyperimmuneanti-rP44 polyclonal antiserum was generated by intraperitoneal immunizationof male BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) with affinity-purified rP44 as describedabove. Primary immunization of each animal was done with 15 mg of purifiedFIG. 1. Restriction map of a 6.9-kb genomic DNA fragment including the P44 gene of the HGE agent.

Two boosts of 10 mg each of rP44 inFreund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant followed on days 14 and 28. Hyperimmune serumobtained 14 days after the last boost was used in Western immunoblot analysis asdescribed below.Western immunoblot analysis. The affinity-purified rP44 and purified HGEorganisms were used for Western immunoblot analysis. Western immunoblottingwas performed by a procedure described elsewhere (31). Briefly, uninfectedHL-60 cells, purified HGE agent, E. chaffeensis, B. burgdorferi (HBH-1), andrP44 protein separated by 10% PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheetand then the sheet was immersed in TBS (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.4]) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and 5% milk at 4\u00b0C overnight tosaturate protein-binding site. The antigen electroblotted onto the nitrocellulosemembranes was incubated with the primary mouse, human, or horse sera at a1:1,000 dilution and then with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified anti-hu-man, anti-horse, or anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.,Gaithersburg, Md.) at a 1:1,000 or 1:2,000 dilution. The peroxidase-positivebands were detected by immersing the sheet in a developing solution (70 mMsodium acetate [pH 6.2]) containing 0.3% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and 0.03% H2O2 at room temperature for5 min. The enzyme reaction was terminated by washing the sheet in 0.1 MH2SO4.Dot immunoblot assay. The dot immunoblot assay was performed by using aBio-Rad dot blot apparatus. The affinity-purified rP44 protein in TBS was blottedonto the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) and thenimmersed in T-TBS containing 5% milk at room temperature for 30 min, airdried, and stored at 220\u00b0C until required. Based on the results of a quantitativeanalysis (see Fig. 5), 0.5 mg of rP44 per dot was used in the immunoassay to assaythe clinical specimens. For the immunoassay, sera to be tested were diluted at1:1,000 in T-TBS containing 5% milk and incubated with the antigen dots for 1 hat room temperature. The sera used in this study were from HGE patientscharacterized previously (26, 31). After being washed three times with T-TBS,the nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified anti-human IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry) at a 1:2,000 dilution. The perox-idase-positive bands were detected by immersing the sheet in a developingsolution as described in \u201cWestern immunoblot analysis.\u201d The color density wasmeasured by using background correction of ImageQuaNT program (MolecularDynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.).RESULTSCloning, sequencing and overexpression of the 44-kDa ma-jor surface protein gene of the HGE agent. An HGE agentgenomic library was constructed in lZAPII phage and identi-fied by immunoscreening with horse anti-HGE agent serum asdescribed in Materials and Methods. One of the positive cloneswhich expressed a 44-kDa antigenic protein was namedpHGE1221. The insert size of pHGE1221 was approximately6.9 kb. The nucleotide sequence of recombinant plasmidpHGE1221 was determined by the primer-walking method.The sequence of pHGE1221 contained five ORFs, and thesecond ORF, 1,239 bp in size, encoded a 413-amino-acid pro-tein with a molecular mass of 43,739 Da including signal pep-tide (Fig. 1). This ORF (ORF2) was found to contain 44-kDaantigen because the N-terminal 10-amino-acid sequence ofnative 44-kDa major outer membrane protein in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2) was identical to the NH2-terminalamino acid sequence (without a 37-amino acid signal peptide)of the ORF2 predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The44-kDa major outer membrane protein corresponded to the49-kDa protein in our previous study (31) due to the variationof the prestained standard in which the molecular mass ofovalbumin was recently changed from 51 to 47 kDa in accor-dance with the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Bio-Rad).ORF1 contained 759 nucleotide base pairs encoding 253amino acids without a start codon. Two regions in ORF1 werefound to have the identical sequences within ORF2 (Fig. 1).These conserved regions, named R1 and R2, encoded 59 and65 amino acids, respectively.Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the P44 proteinof the HGE agent is a typical transmembrane protein whichcontains alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic motifs with asignal peptide of 37 amino acid residues. A search of theGenBank database revealed significant amino acid sequencesimilarity between the HGE agent P44 and major surface pro-tein 2 (MSP-2) of Anaplasma marginale, a bovine intraeryth-rocytic bacteria (66% similarity; 44% identity). A. marginaleMSP-2 is an immunoprotective protein encoded by a polymor-phic multigene family (22). The regions conserved between theHGE agent P44 and A. marginale MSP-2 were found located inthe hydrophobic motifs. ORF3, -4, and -5 are currently underinvestigation.We expressed the entire P44 by cloning the whole P44 geneinto the pET30a vector. However, the expression level was verylow (data not shown). To effectively overexpress antigenicepitopes of P44 of the HGE agent, the DNA sequence codingfor a 219-amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of23,246 Da from the NH2 terminus (including 8 amino acidresidues of signal peptide) was subcloned into the pET30aexpression vector. The recombinant plasmid was namedpEP44. The expressed rP44 antigenic protein purified by af-finity chromatography was 35 kDa in size by SDS-PAGE. Itwas a fusion protein in which a 44-amino-acid sequence in-cluding the His tag peptide derived from the pET30a expres-sion vector was located at the NH2 terminus (Fig. 2).Presence of multigenes homologous to P44 gene. GenomicSouthern blot analysis with several restriction enzymes, includ-ing EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and SstI, revealed that the 32P-labeledP44 gene probe hybridizes with multiple DNA fragments of theHGE agent (Fig. 3). All five restriction enzymes used gener-ated approximately 10 bands with different densities. The re-striction enzymes used did not cut within the P44 gene that wascloned in this study, and therefore the Southern blot resultshowed that the multigenes homologous to the P44 gene werepresent in the HGE agent genome. The exact number of P44gene copies cannot be determined, since restriction site poly-FIG. 2. SDS-PAGE patterns of the antigens used in this study.

Western immunoblot analy-sis showed that mouse anti-rP44 serum strongly reacted with44- to 42-kDa proteins in all of the different HGE agent strainsexcept strain 2, in which three proteins of 42, 40, and 38 kDawere recognized (Fig. 4). The mouse antiserum also recog-nized a 27-kDa protein in isolates 2 and 6 and a 15-kDa proteinin isolates 2, 3, 6, and USG (Fig. 4). Horse anti-HGE serumand 11 serum samples from HGE patients used in this studyspecifically recognized rP44 (Fig. 5). All of these patients werepreviously confirmed to have HGE by PCR and/or cultureisolation (26, 31). Five serum samples collected over a 2-yearperiod from a patient (patient 21) at different stages of illnessreacted with rP44 (Fig. 5). This patient was suspected of havingreinfection with the HGE agent, since the IFA titer at 8 daysbefore the sample 21-5 serum collection date was 1:40. Theresult indicates that regardless of the stages of infection orreinfection, P44 is the major antigen recognized by the patientsera. The horse anti-E. equi serum strongly reacted with bothnative 44-kDa protein in whole-cell organisms and rP44 of theHGE agent (Fig. 6). Human anti-E. chaffeensis and rabbitanti-B. burgdorferi did not recognize rP44. This suggests thatrP44 might be used as a testing antigen to differentiate infec-tion with the HGE agent from infection with E. chaffeensis orB. burgdorferi. Two patients, 21 and 22, were diagnosed ashaving coinfection with B. burgdorferi and the HGE agent. Thesera of patients 21 and 22 reacted positively with rP44 and theHGE agent as well as with the antigenic components of B.burgdorferi (Fig. 7). Three serum samples from patients withLyme borreliosis were also investigated by Western blot anal-ysis using HGE agent organisms and rP44 as antigens. None ofthem had a positive reaction (data not shown).Dot blot immunoassay. To determine the optimal amount ofantigen per dot and the optimal dilution of patient sera for dotblot immunoassay, nitrocellulose membrane strips, each hav-ing eight dots containing different amounts of purified rP44antigen, were incubated with five different serum samples withIFA titers ranging from 1:2,560 to ,1:20 (Fig. 8, insert). Therewas a positive correlation between the color densities of thedot reactions and the IFA titers when .50 ng of recombinantantigen was used per dot. These results indicate that the dotimmunoassay using rP44 protein provides a simpler serodiag-FIG. 3.

Samplessubjected to SDS-PAGE consisted of 10 mg of purified whole-cell preparation ofHGE agent strain 13 (23), affinity-purified rP44, HL-60 cells, and E. coliBL21(DE3)/pLysS.

No reactionwas detected with negative control sera (IFA titer, ,1:20) (Fig.8, insert). The color density values of each dot measured afterbackground correction by the ImageQuaNT program areshown in Fig. 8. Since the difference in color density amongsera with different IFA titers was quite distinct and the colordensity progressively increased (especially at antigen amountsof 0.25 to 1 mg per dot), 0.5 mg per dot was used in thefollowing experiments. This amount of protein can distinguishboth high and low titers.A total of 25 clinical patient serum samples with differentIFA titers (from 1:2,560 to ,1:20) were examined by dot blotimmunoassay using 0.5 mg of affinity-purified rP44 per dot. Asshown in Fig. 9A, the color density of the each dot is highlycorrelated with the IFA titer. In five tested serum samples withIFA titers of ,1:20, the color density of one dot can be clearlydistinguished from that of other negative sera by the nakedeye. This serum sample was collected in the acute phase frompatient 3 (31), who was positive for the HGE agent by nestedPCR and culture isolation. This patient developed a convales-cent-phase IFA titer of 1:640 (Fig. 9A, dot E1). The remainingfour serum samples with titers of ,1:20 were derived frompatients who were negative by convalescent-phase serum IFA,PCR, and isolation (31).DISCUSSIONThe availability of recombinant immunodominant majorsurface proteins of the HGE agent will greatly assist in thediagnosis of this intracellular bacterium and elucidation ofpathogenesis of HGE such as mechanisms of invasion of hostcells and intracellular survival and immune responses. In pre-vious studies, 44- to 42-kDa proteins or proteins of similar sizeswere shown to be immunodominant major surface proteins ofthe HGE agent, which are recognized by all the sera fromHGE patients tested (4, 16, 31). The present study is the firstreport that a 44-kDa major outer membrane protein of theHGE agent has been identified and characterized at the mo-lecular and protein sequence level. Interestingly, the sequenceanalysis of P44 also revealed significant homology to an immu-noprotective A. marginale major surface protein, MSP-2, whichis encoded by a polymorphic multigene family (22).Polymorphic multigene families encoding the major outermembrane proteins have been identified in E. chaffeensis andA. marginale that are closely related to the HGE agent basedon 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison. In E. chaffeensis, sixcopies of the P28 gene were tandemly arrayed 1 kb apart in theehrlichial chromosome. This multiple gene family of E.chaffeensis encodes a group of immunodominant major outermembrane proteins ranging in size from 23 to 30 kDa (20). A.marginale MSP-2 and -3 are also encoded by multiple genefamilies (2, 22). These latter multiple gene copies were distrib-uted widely throughout the chromosome. In addition, strainvariations of these gene copies were demonstrated. Althoughthe exact number of copies of the P44 gene of the HGE agenthas not been determined, Southern blot analysis showed mul-tigenes homologous to the P44 gene in the genome of the HGEagent isolate 13. In addition, identical sequences (R1 and R2)present in ORF1 and ORF2 (P44 gene) may also provideevidence for the existence of multiple homologous P44 genesin the genome of the HGE agent. Further molecular geneticstudies are required to clarify the role of the multiple copies ofthe P44 gene in antigenic and biologic polymorphism of theHGE agent.Our Western immunoblot results showed that the rP44 pro-tein specifically reacted with HGE patient sera having differentIFA titers. This indicates that rP44 is properly folded, exposingthe specific antigenic epitopes which are recognized by the hostimmune system. Infections caused by E. chaffeensis or B. burg-dorferi are the two most important infections in humans thatare related to HGE. A diverse serologic cross-reactivity be-tween the HGE agent and E. chaffeensis was reported by uspreviously and by others (1, 6, 26). The human anti-E. chaffeen-FIG. 6.

The sera used in this studyincluded horse anti-E. equi serum, human anti-E. chaffeensis serum, and rabbitanti-B. burgdorferi serum. Antigens subjected to SDS-PAGE were 10 mg ofpurified whole-cell preparation of HGE agent isolate 13, E. chaffeensis, or B.burgdorferi, affinity-purified rP44, uninfected HL-60 cells, and E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS. These proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet andincubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of antisera.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.sis serum used in the present study was kindly provided by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. It was collectedfrom a patient with a typical E. chaffeensis infection and char-acterized by IFA testing and Western blot analysis (25). Ad-ditionally, in unpublished data of our laboratory, 20 differentserum samples from HGE patients were analyzed by Westernimmunoblotting against both the HGE agent and E. chaffeensisantigens. Cross-reactive antigens between the HGE agent andE. chaffeensis were found in the size range of 55 to 60 kDarather than 44 kDa. Therefore, we believe that rP44 can beused to differentiate HGE and E. chaffeensis infections. More-over, it had been reported that false-positive Lyme diseasetests can occur in cases of HGE infection (30). These recentresults suggest that potential cross-reactive antigens amongthree pathogenic microorganisms might complicate serodiag-nostic evaluation of these diseases. The results of the Westernimmunoblot analysis in this study showed that rP44 is notrecognized by antisera against E. chaffeensis or B. burgdorferi.Therefore, use of rP44 as the testing antigen is advantageoussince it eliminates the possibility of cross-reactivity between theHGE agent and these microorganisms, which is caused bycommon antigenic components such as heat shock proteins inwhole-organism preparations as suggested previously (31).On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison,the Ehrlichia species along with several related genera can bedivided into three distinct groups. The HGE agent is closelyrelated to the E. equi-E. phagocytophila group (9). The majorantigenic components of organisms in the three groups ofEhrlichia resemble each other but are quite different betweengroups (4, 20, 24). Therefore, within each group, ehrlichialorganisms are highly cross-reactive antigenically and share sev-eral homologous surface antigens. Dumler et al. previouslyreported that serum from an HGE patient reacted with the44-kDa protein of E. equi and E. phagocytophila (12). Diversityof major antigens has been observed previously among differ-ent strains of Ehrlichia risticii and E. chaffeensis (8, 10). Al-though only little is known about antigenic variants amongstrains of the HGE agent (4, 31), we previously demonstratedFIG. 8. Optical density analysis of the reaction of the HGE agent rP44 antigen (Ag) with patient sera having different IFA testing titers was performed by usingImageQuaNT computer program. Color development of various amounts of affinity-purified rP44 of the HGE agent was done after reaction with patient sera havingdifferent HGE agent IFA titers and with negative control sera (insert). The sera were diluted at 1:1,000.VOL. 36, 1998 MAJOR OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF THE HGE AGENT 1671a strain polymorphism among the major antigenic proteins ofthe HGE agent (31). However, the mouse antiserum specific torP44 strongly recognized 44- to 42-kDa proteins in all isolatestested, indicating that the major antigenic proteins in differentHGE agent isolates are antigenically cross-reactive with rP44(31). Since all HGE agent isolates used in these studies wereisolated from the same geographic regions in New York State,the results may not represent all of the different serotypesexisting in the United States. However, our observation of thereaction of horse anti-HGE (Wisconsin strain) and anti-E. equisera with rP44 suggests that rP44 has an HGE-E. equi group-specific epitope. It is, therefore, probably useful for serodiag-nosis of all strains of the HGE agent.Additionally, the mouse antiserum specific to rP44 also re-acted with a 27-kDa protein with two of the isolates and a15-kDa protein with four of the isolates even when proteinaseinhibitor (e.g., phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added dur-ing the preparation of antigens. Therefore, it is unlikely thatthese antigens were generated from the degradation of P44 inthese isolates. According to the data presented in this paper,the P44 proteins might be encoded by a multigene family andsome of these homologous genes might be truncated either atthe N terminus (e.g., ORF1 in pHGE1221) or the C terminus.It is possible that the 27- and 15-kDa antigens were encoded bya gene whose C-terminal portion was truncated. In addition, inour previous study (20), we identified a multigene family en-coding a group of major antigens of E. chaffeensis. We dem-onstrated the possibility that the P23 protein is generated fromOMP-1F (P30) by specific processing. Whether this also hap-pens to the 27- or 15-kDa antigen of the HGE agent remainsto be seen.The dot immunoblot assay has been developed for detectionof several infectious agents (15, 21, 29). The advantages of thisassay are that no particular instrument is required and theinterpretation of the results is easy for inexperienced personnelsince positive and negative reactions can be distinguished bythe naked eye. In the dot immunoblot assay described herein,the color density of positive sera (IFA titer, .1:20) is signifi-cantly stronger than that of negative controls. Therefore, an-tibody-positive sera can be easily distinguished from antibody-negative sera by the naked eye. One acute-stage serum samplewith an IFA titer of less than 1:20 was positive by the dot blotimmunoassay. This may indicate that the dot blot immunoas-say using rP44 is more sensitive than IFA testing. However,another acute-phase serum sample, from patient 4 (31), whowas positive for the HGE agent infection by IFA testing ofconvalescent-phase serum, nested PCR, and culture isolation,showed a negative reaction in the dot blot immunoassay. Thismay be explained by the slower or lower level of humoralimmune response against HGE infection in this individualbecause the IFA titer of convalescent-phase sera collectedfrom the same patient 2 weeks later was only 1:80.For the serodiagnosis of HGE infection, IFA testing iswidely used. However, the final evaluation needs specificequipment and trained personnel. It also requires cultivationof the HGE agent, which may change its antigenic compositionduring passage. Use of whole infected cells or whole organismsas antigen increases the false-positive rate due to antigeniccross-reactivity or nonspecific antibody binding. The affinity-purified recombinant major antigenic protein would provide astable and economical source of the pure antigen for specificand sensitive serologic tests. Especially since the dot blot orenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant anti-gens can be automated in the diagnostic laboratory, a simpleand rapid diagnosis of HGE infection could be made. Al-though more patient serum samples must be tested to verify itsusefulness in the clinical laboratory, the recombinant P44 ofthe present study should greatly advance HGE serodiagnosis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank John Lowbridge of the Peptide and Protein EngineeringLaboratory, The Ohio State University, for his assistance in NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing and Qin Lu of the NeurobiologicalCenter, The Ohio State University, for her assistance in DNA sequenc-ing.
