Here we have investigated therole of these proteins in biofilm formation, virulencefactor synthesis and virulence of P. aeruginosa. Muta-tion of PA4108 and PA4781 led to an increase in thelevel of cyclic-di-GMP in P. aeruginosa, consistentwith the predicted activity of the encoded proteins ascyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterases. Mutation of bothgenes led to reduced swarming motility but had dif-fering effects on production of the virulence factorspyocyanin, pyoverdin and ExoS. Mutation of PA2572had no effect on cyclic-di-GMP levels and did notinfluence swarming motility. However, PA2572 had anegative influence on swarming that was cryptic andwas revealed only after removal of an uncharacter-ized C-terminal domain. Mutation of PA4108, PA4781and PA2572 had distinct effects on biofilm formationand architecture of P. aeruginosa. All three proteinscontributed to virulence of P. aeruginosa to larvae ofthe Greater Wax moth Galleria mellonella.IntroductionThe nucleotide cyclic di-GMP [bis-(3\u2032-5\u2032)-cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate] is a second messenger inbacteria that regulates a range of functions includingdevelopmental transitions, polysaccharide synthesis,adhesion, biofilm formation, the synthesis of virulencefactors and virulence in bacterial pathogens (R\u00f6mlinget al., 2005; Jenal and Malone, 2006; Ryan et al., 2006a;Cotter and Stibitz, 2007). The level of cyclic di-GMP inbacterial cells is influenced by both synthesis and degra-dation. The GGDEF protein domain synthesizes cyclicdi-GMP, whereas EAL and HD-GYP domains are involvedin cyclic di-GMP hydrolysis (Paul et al., 2004; Christenet al., 2005; Ryjenkov et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005;Tamayo et al., 2005; Ryan et al., 2006b). GGDEF andEAL domains were first linked to cyclic di-GMP turnoverthrough studies of the regulation of cellulose synthesis inGluconacetobacter xylinus (Tal et al., 1998). Subse-quently, a number of reports have described the role ofGGDEF/EAL domain proteins in the control of differentcellular functions in diverse bacteria and the enzymaticactivity of the two domains has been established. In con-trast, comparatively little is known about the role ofHD-GYP domain proteins in bacteria, although bioinfor-matic studies indicate that genes encoding proteins withthis domain occur in many genomic sequences represent-ing all major classes of bacteria (Galperin, 2005).Studies of the function and role of the HD-GYP domainhave thus far focused on the regulatory protein RpfG fromthe plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. RpfG isrequired for full virulence of X. campestris and acts topositively regulate the synthesis of virulence factors suchas extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccha-ride, positively regulate motility, but negatively regulateadherence and biofilm formation (Slater et al., 2000; Dowet al., 2003; Crossman and Dow, 2004; Dow et al., 2006;Ryan et al., 2007). The isolated HD-GYP domain of RpfGcan hydrolyse cyclic di-GMP to GMP via a linear interme-diate (Ryan et al., 2006b). Mutation of the HD residuescomprising the presumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYPdomain abolishes both the regulatory activity and enzy-matic activity against cyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b).The work in this paper had the overall aim of broaden-ing our understanding of the cellular function of HD-GYPdomain proteins by examination of their role in the humanpathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The P. aeruginosagenome encodes two proteins (PA4108, PA4781) with anHD-GYP domain and a third protein PA2572, which con-tains a variant HD-GYP domain (specifically YN-GYP).

The expression of PA4108,PA4781 and PA2572 is substantially increased duringco-culture of P. aeruginosa with human epithelial cells(Ichikawa et al., 2000; Chugani and Greenberg, 2007)and PA2572 and PA4781 are induced by mucopurulentfluid from cystic fibrosis patients (Wolfgang et al., 2004).These observations raise the question as to whetherthese proteins act to regulate factors associated with thevirulence of P. aeruginosa, an issue we address here. Ourfindings indicate that PA4108 and PA4781 are cyclicdi-GMP phosphodiesterases that regulate the synthesisand/or secretion of the virulence determinants pyocyanin,pyoverdin and ExoS as well as having a positive effect onswarming. In contrast, PA2572, which is inactive in cyclicdi-GMP hydrolysis, has a cryptic negative influence onswarming. Mutations of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572have distinct effects on the synthesis of different virulencedeterminants and on biofilm formation and architecturebut all mutants have reduced virulence to larvae of theGreater Wax Moth Galleria mellonella.ResultsDomain organization of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781The HD-GYP domain in PA2572 and PA4781 is foundin association with an N-terminal CheY-like responsereceiver (REC) regulatory domain. PA2572 additionallyhas an uncharacterized C-terminal extension that isabsent from PA4781 and from RpfG of X. campestris.PA4108 has an HD-GYP domain with additionalN-terminal and C-terminal domains that are uncharacter-ized. The presence of the REC domain suggests thatPA2572 and PA4781 are elements within two componentregulatory systems. Although PA2572 is adjacent to agene (PA2571) encoding a sensor kinase, no gene encod-ing a sensor kinase is found within the genomic vicinity ofPA4781, which appears therefore to be an \u2018orphan\u2019regulator.Analysis of the enzymatic activities of the HD-GYPdomains of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 by expressionin Xanthomonas campestrisAs outlined in Introduction, mutation of rpfG in X. campes-tris leads to a substantial reduction in the synthesis of theextracellular enzymes endoglucanase, endomannanaseand protease. Expression of the isolated HD-GYP domainof RpfG in the rpfG mutant background restores enzymeproduction to near wild-type levels. This effect, which isalso seen with this domain carrying a C-terminal His6 tag,depends upon the HD diad and the ability to degradecyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b). Expression in theX. campestris rpfG mutant was used to analyse the enzy-matic activities of the isolated HD-GYP domains ofPA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 that had C-terminal His6tags. HD-GYP domains from both PA4108 and PA4781were able to restore production of endoglucanase,endomannanase and protease towards wild-type levels(Fig. 1A\u2013C). In contrast, no effect was seen with theYN-GYP domain of PA2572 (Fig. 1A\u2013C). Western analy-sis with antisera against the His6 tag showed that all thedomains were expressed (Fig. 1D).The effects of expression of the various HD-GYPdomains on the cellular level of cyclic di-GMP inX. campestris were also determined. The levels of thenucleotide were elevated in the rpfG mutant comparedwith the wild-type X. campestris strain 8004 (Fig. 2;Fig. S1). Expression of the HD-GYP domains of RpfG,PA4108 and PA4781 caused a reduction in the level,although expression of the YN-GYP domain of PA2572had no effect (Fig. 2). The absence of any effect with theYN-GYP variant domain suggested that this does nothave any enzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP. Thiscontention was further examined by assessment of theeffects of alteration of the conserved H231 and D232residues of RpfG to Y and N residues respectively. Thesechanges (H231Y, D232N) were introduced by site-directed mutagenic PCR into the construct expressingHD-GYPHis6 (see Experimental procedures). Westernanalysis with antisera against the His6 tag showed thatthe variant protein was expressed to the same level as thewild-type (Fig. S2). However, these alterations in the HDdiad eliminated the regulatory activity of the HD-GYPHis6domain in restoring extracellular enzyme synthesis(Fig. S2).Taken together, these findings suggest that theHD-GYP domains of PA4108 and PA4781 have cyclicdi-GMP phosphodiesterase activity but that the YN-GYPdomain of PA2572 is inactive. Unfortunately, it was notpossible to purify sufficient protein to examine these pro-posed enzymatic activities directly.Phenotypic effects of mutation of genes encodingHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosaSpecific disruption of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 wascarried out using pEX18-Gm as described in Experimen-tal procedures. The mutant strains were tested for thecellular level of cyclic di-GMP and for production of factorsor phenotypes that have been associated with P. aerugi-nosa virulence. Mutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781had no effect on growth in minimal M9 medium orcomplex LB medium. Mutation of PA4108 and PA4781gave rise to increased levels of cyclic di-GMP (Fig. 3),consistent with the role of the HD-GYP domain in cyclicdi-GMP degradation. In contrast, there was no discernibleHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1127\u00a9 2008 The AuthorsJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136difference in the level of cyclic di-GMP between thePA2572 mutant and the wild-type (Fig. 3). Introduction ofthe PA4108 and PA4781 genes cloned in pBBRMCS1-Cminto the appropriate mutants reduced cyclic di-GMP levelsto wild-type (Fig. 3).Mutation of PA4108 and PA4781 led to reduction in bothswarming and twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data notshown), whereas mutation of PA2572 had no effect oneither form of motility. All strains showed wild-type swim-ming motility. Introduction of PA4108 and PA4781 genesinto the appropriate mutants restored wild-type swarmingand twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data not shown).Mutation of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572 had differenteffects on the production of the phenazine, pyocyanin, thesiderophore pyoverdine and rhamnolipid (Fig. 4; Fig. S3).Mutation of PA4781 led to an increase in pyoverdineproduction, whereas mutation of PA2572 led to a reduc-tion and mutation of PA4108 had no significant effect(Fig. 4A). In contrast, only mutation of PA4108 had asignificant effect on pyocyanin production, which wasreduced compared with wild-type (Fig. 4B). The produc-tion of rhamnolipid was elevated in the PA2572 mutant butwas at wild-type level in both the PA4108 and PA4781mutant strains (Fig. S3). Mutation of PA4108 but notPA2572 or PA4781 led to reduction in the extracellularlevels of the Type III-secreted effector ExoS (Fig. 5A).Introduction of the cloned PA4108 into the PA4108 mutantrestored ExoS levels to wild-type (Fig. 5B). Overall, theseresults indicated that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 havedistinct regulatory effects on production of certain viru-lence factors in P. aeruginosa, although PA4108 andPA4781 have the same influence on motility.Fig. 1.

DNA encoding the different HD-GYP domains with a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pLAFR3 and constructs introducedinto the rpfG mutant of X. campestris. The relative level of mannanase (A) and endoglucanase (B) in culture supernatants of different bacterialstrains was measured after growth in NYGB medium to an OD at 600 nm of 2.0 and compared with that of the wild-type X. campestris strain8004.

In FAB medium, wild-type P. aeruginosa devel-oped characteristic mushroom structures with a stalk andcap (Fig. 6A). The PA2572 mutant formed similar struc-tures, but unlike the wild-type, had central hollowing of thestalk with a region that was devoid of bacteria, as seen bystaining with either the live stain Syto9 (Fig. 6B) or deadstain propidium iodide (data not shown). The PA4108mutant produced a flatter biofilm than wild-type withsmaller mushroom structures and reduced biomass(Fig. 6C; Fig. S4E). The PA4781 mutant produced abiofilm with little heterogeneity that covered a largepercentage of the surface and encompassed a fewmushroom-like structures (Fig. 6D). Introduction of clonedPA2572, PA4108 or PA4781 genes into the appropriatemutant strains restored the formation of mushroom struc-tures similar to those of the wild-type in each case(Fig. S4). These differences in architecture of the biofilmsformed by the different mutants provide further support forthe notion that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 have distinctregulatory actions.Mutation of genes encoding HD-GYP domain proteinsinfluences virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosaThe virulence of different strains of P. aeruginosa to larvaeof G. mellonella were assessed as described in Experi-mental procedures, using 10 larvae at each inoculumlevel. The minimum inoculum of the wild-type required tokill all 10 larvae was 12 \ufffd 3 cfu (n = 9). For strains withmutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781, a higher levelof bacteria was required to kill all 10 larvae, indicating areduction in virulence. The minimum inoculum level (cfu)was 1000 for the PA2572 mutant, 1100 for the PA4108mutant and 745 for the PA4781 mutant. ComplementedPA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 strains had wild-type levelsof virulence, with minimum inoculum level between 10and 15 cfu. All values are the means of quadruplicatemeasurements. The whole experiment was repeatedtwice with essentially the same result. These findingsindicated that all three HD-GYP domain proteins contrib-ute to virulence in the Galleria model.A cryptic regulatory activity of the YN-GYP domainprotein PA2572In some cases functions of domains within modular pro-teins may be cryptic and may only be revealed by analysisof the phenotypes of multiple transposon insertions ineach gene or by the generation of specific deletionmutants (Kulesekara et al., 2006; Tarutina et al., 2006). Apreliminary indication of such a cryptic activity of theYN-GYP domain of PA2572 was provided by the analysisof the motility phenotypes of four mutants with transposoninsertions in different sites in PA2572 (Jacobs et al., 2003;Fig. 7A, which is a gene of 1344 nt. Although transposoninsertions at positions 113, 615 and 928 did not influenceswarming or twitching, the insertion at position 1107 (instrain 16841) led to a reduction in both types of motility(Fig. 7B and C; Fig. S5). All transposon mutants showedwild-type swimming motility, however (Fig. S5). The inser-Fig. 2.

Introduction of the wild-type PA2572 genecloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR into strain 16841 did notrestore wild-type motility (data not shown). These findingssuggested that truncation of PA2572 had revealed adominant negative regulatory activity of the protein onP. aeruginosa twitching and swarming motility. Althoughthe insertion in strain 16841 led to a reduction in motility,there was no effect on the production of pyocyanin,pyoverdin or rhamnolipid (data not shown).The YN-GYP domain has a dominant negativeeffect on swarming motilityThe hypothesis that the truncated PA2572 has a dominantnegative effect on motility was further tested by experi-ments in which the effects of expression of a truncatedprotein with only REC and YN-GYP domains (encodedby nucleotides 1\u20131110) were examined. Constructsexpressing a protein with both REC and YN-GYP domainscloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR or the REC and YN-GYPdomains with a His6 tag cloned into pLAFR3 (see Experi-mental procedures) were introduced into the wild-typestrains mPAO1 and PAO1. This resulted in a negativeeffect on swarming and twitching in both strains (Fig. 8).These effects were also seen when the construct clonedin pBBRMCS5-Gm was introduced into strain 8166(Fig. S6), which has a transposon insertion at position 113of PA2572 (Fig. 7A). In contrast, expression of eitherthe REC domain alone, the YN-GYP domain with theC-terminal extension (both with His6 tags) or of theYN-GYP domain alone had no effect on swarming motility(Fig. S7A and data not shown). Western analysis withantisera against the His6 tag showed that the differentproteins were however expressed (Fig. S7B). Takentogether, these results support the view that PA2572 hasa cryptic dominant negative effect on motility and indicatethat this action requires both the REC and YN-GYPdomains.Fig. 4. Mutation of genes encoding different HD-GYP domain proteins has different phenotypic effects in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Pyoverdineproduction; (B) pyocyanin production; and (C) swarming motility on 0.5% Eiken agar. Mutation of PA2572 did not influence swarming (notshown). The phenotypic effects of mutation could be reversed by introduction of the cloned genes into the appropriate mutants.1130 R. P. Ryan et al.\u00a9 2008 The AuthorsJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136DiscussionHD-GYP domains proteins regulate virulence factorsynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosaThe work in this paper provides evidence that theHD-GYP domain proteins PA4108 and PA4781 are cyclicdi-GMP phosphodiesterases that act in regulation of motil-ity, synthesis of virulence determinants and biofilm archi-tecture in P. aeruginosa. Mutation of either PA4108 orPA4781 leads to a reduction in motility associated withelevated cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. Observationsfrom a range of bacteria have similarly linked lower levelsof the nucleotide with motile behaviour and higher cellularlevels with sessile behaviour and biofilm formation (Simmet al., 2004). This apparently common action of PA4108and PA4781 in regulation of motility contrasts with distincteffects of mutation of PA4108 and PA4781 on biofilmarchitecture and the synthesis of virulence determinants;mutation of PA4108 has different effects to mutation ofPA4781 on the synthesis of pyoverdin and pyocyanin andonly mutation of PA4108 influences the levels of the typeIII-secreted effector ExoS. The mechanistic basis forthese apparently diverse actions of HD-GYP domain pro-teins remains obscure.An enzymatically inactive HD-GYP domain has aregulatory roleA number of lines of evidence indicate that the YN-GYPdomain of PA2572 has no activity as a cyclic di-GMPphosphodiesterase. Expression of PA2572, the YN-GYPdomain attached to the uncharacterized C-terminaldomain or the isolated YN-GYP domain did not restoreextracellular enzyme activity to the rpfG mutant ofFig. 5.

Furthermore, the H231Y, D232N alteration in thepresumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYP domain of RpfGabolished the regulatory effect on extracellular enzymesynthesis in X. campestris. Nevertheless, mutation ofPA2572 influenced biofilm architecture and caused over-production of rhamnolipid. Boles and colleagues (2005)have demonstrated that rhamnolipids mediate formationof hollows or cavities within the centre of P. aeruginosabiofilms and have proposed that this is associated with theprocess of bacterial detachment. It is therefore plausiblethat the hollowing of the stalk of the mushroom producedby the PA2572 mutant is a consequence of the over-production of rhamnolipid by this strain.Further to this, a cryptic regulatory role for the YN-GYPdomain on swarming was revealed through the use ofmultiple transposon mutants within PA2572 and byexpression of the different domain combinations in thewild-type P. aeruginosa. Although the complete loss ofPA2572 has no apparent effect on swarming, the loss ofthe C-terminal domain results in a protein with a dominantFig. 7.

This construct also had no enzymaticactivity against cyclic di-GMP as assessed by heterolo-gous expression in X. campestris. As pointed out byKulesekara and colleagues (2006), analysis of the phe-notypic effects of expressing such truncated proteins mayor may not represent regulatory functions that occurduring the biological function of the full-length protein. Themechanism(s) by which the YN-GYP domain exerts theseeffects are unknown, but it is plausible that this involvesprotein\u2013protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid analysishas revealed physical interactions between the HD-GYPdomain of RpfG from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citriand a range of proteins including several with a GGDEFdomain as well as other regulators (Andrade et al., 2006).Although the biological relevance of such interactions hasyet to be tested, these observations suggest a scenariowhereby the YN-GYP domain could modulate the activityof a subset of GGDEF domain proteins or other regulators(Andrade et al., 2006) with a consequent negative effecton swarming. It is also possible that the YN-GYP domaininterferes with the action of the HD-GYP domain proteinsPA4108 and PA4718, which have opposite effects onswarming to (truncated) PA2572.Conservation of the C-terminal domain of PA2572 inother HD-GYP domain proteinsOur results are consistent with a model in which theC-terminal domain of PA2572 acts to inhibit the function ofthe YN-GYP domain in regulation of swarming, althoughthey give no clues as to the mechanism of inhibition orhow this is relieved to allow the proposed action of thedomain. Examination of the databases using BLASTPindicated that proteins with the same domain structure asPA2572, including the C-terminal domain, occur in a widerange of bacteria including other Pseudomonas spp.,Burkholderia spp. and Vibrio cholerae. Many of theseproteins have variations in the HD motif that include HG,HN, HE and HQ in addition to YN, which appears to berestricted to the pseudomonads. It remains to be deter-mined if these proteins with alteration of the HD diad haveenzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP.The finding that an enzymatically inactive HD-GYPdomain can have a regulatory activity has parallels instudies of GGDEF and EAL domains, where variations inthe amino acids within the GGDEF and EAL motifs occurnaturally in some proteins. Domains with sequences thatare divergent from the consensus may have lost enzy-matic activity, but may still play a regulatory role. In theGGDEF-EAL domain proteins CC3396 from Caulobactercrescentus and FimX from P. aeruginosa, binding of GTPto an enzymatically inactive GGDEF domain acts to regu-late the activity of the EAL domain in cyclic di-GMPhydrolysis (Christen et al., 2005; Kazmierczak et al.,2006). Similar considerations may apply to inactive EALdomains (Schmidt et al., 2005), which perhaps can bindcyclic di-GMP. As well as intramolecular effects, enzymati-cally inactive EAL or GGDEF domains could conceivablyregulate cellular processes through intermolecular inter-actions with other proteins or other molecules, in a fashioninfluenced by the binding of cyclic di-GMP or GTP.HD-GYP domain proteins regulate virulence ofPseudomonas aeruginosaMutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 led to a reduc-tion in bacterial virulence in the larvae of G. mellonella. InP. aeruginosa strain PA14, the type III-secreted effectorsExoT and ExoU have a significant role in G. mellonellakilling, although translocation of ExoT or ExoU alone issufficient to give near wild-type levels of killing. (P. aerugi-nosa PA14 has no exoS gene). As far as we are aware,the role of ExoS in virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 toG. mellonella has not yet been established. Althoughmutation of PA4108 leads to a reduction in the levels ofExoS we cannot infer a causal relationship to the reduc-tion of killing; the processes that contribute to virulencethat are regulated by the HD-GYP domain proteins inbacteria within the host are unknown.These observations add to a body of work that indicatesa role for proteins with GGDEF and/or EAL domain, andby inference cyclic di-GMP, in the regulation of virulenceand virulence factor synthesis in P. aeruginosa as well asin a number of human, animal and plant pathogens includ-ing Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Xanthomonascampestris (Hisert et al., 2005; Tischler and Camilli, 2005;Kulesekara et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2007). As withP. aeruginosa, the genomes of many of these bacteriaencode between 1 and 4 HD-GYP domain proteins,although they are absent in Salmonella spp. and E. coliand more highly represented in Vibrio spp., where V. chol-erae has 9 and V. vulnificus has 15. HD-GYP domainproteins are also found in a number of other bacterialpathogens of animals including Clostridium perfringens,Bordetella bronchiseptica and Treponema denticola.Whether these proteins play a significant role in the viru-lence of these diverse pathogenic bacteria remains to bedetermined.Experimental proceduresBacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditionsThe bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study arelisted in Table S1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains wereroutinely cultured in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) broth. Xanthomonascampestris strains were routinely grown in NYGB medium,which comprises Bacteriological Peptone (Oxoid, Basing-stoke, UK), 5 g l-1; yeast extract (Difco), 3 g l-1 and glycerol,HD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1133\u00a9 2008 The AuthorsJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u2013113620 g l-1. Antibiotics rifampicin (Rif), tetracycline (Tc), chloram-phenicol (Cm) and gentamycin (Gm) were added whereappropriate.Construction and complementation of PA2572, PA4108and PA4781 mutantsMutants were created by the disruption of gene with the useof the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm (see Table S1). Briefly, aninternal fragment of each of the genes was amplified usingthe primers detailed in Table S2 and was cloned into theTOPO (Invitrogen) vector. This fragment was excised withEcoRI and ligated into the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm cut withthe same enzyme. This construct was introduced into PAO1by electroporation. Mutants were selected by plating on LBagar medium containing gentamicin (20 mg ml-1). Candidatestrains were analysed by colony PCR using the primersdetailed in Table S2 to confirm disruption of the PA2572,PA4108 and PA4781 gene by integration of the suicidevector. Complementing clones were constructed inpBBRMCS3 using DNA fragments amplified using primersdetailed in Table S2.Expression of the HD-GYP domains of P. aeruginosaproteins in Xanthomonas campestrisDNA fragments encoding the HD-GYP domain from PA2572,PA4108 and PA4781 with a C-terminal His6-tag were ampli-fied by PCR by using chromosomal DNA of P. aeruginosastrain PAO1, as template with primers carrying restrictionsites for BamHI and HindIII (see Table S2). These amplifiedfragments were cloned into the TOPO (Invitrogen) vector.The appropriate DNA fragments were excised from theseconstructs using BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pLAFR3that had been cut with the same enzymes so that expressionis under control of the lac promoter of the vector. Constructswere introduced into X. campestris wild-type or rpfG mutantby triparental mating using the helper plasmid pRK2073.Procedures used for Western analysis to examine proteinexpression levels using an anti-His6 antibody are describedin Supporting Information.Phenotypic analysesMethods used for assay of extracellular enzyme activities inX. campestris, and for assays in of motility, pyoverdine, pyo-cyanin, rhamnolipid and ExoS production in P. aeruginosaare given in Supporting Information. Virulence of P. aerugi-nosa to larvae of G. mellonella was tested as described pre-viously (Miyata et al., 2003). Bacterial suspensions from adilution series were inoculated into larvae, with 10 larvaeused for each inoculum level. The minimum inoculumrequired to kill all 10 larvae was determined for each strain.Additional details are given in the Supporting Information.Cultivation and imaging of biofilmsBiofilms were grown in flow chambers with individual channeldimensions of 1 \u00a5 4 \u00a5 40 mm. The flow system wasassembled and prepared as described by Sternberg andTolker-Nielsen (2005). The flow chambers were inoculated byinjecting 350 ml of overnight culture diluted to an OD600 of 0.01into each flow channel with a syringe. After inoculation, flowchannels were left without flow for 1 h, after which mediumflow at a linear rate of 0.2 mm s-1 was started using a WatsonMarlow 205S peristaltic pump.All microscopic observations and image acquisitions wereperformed on an LSM510 confocal laser scanning micro-scope (CLSM) (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped withdetectors and filter sets for monitoring Syto9 fluorescence.Simulated three-dimensional images, shadow projectionsand sections were generated using the Imaris softwarepackage (Bitplane AG, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland).Detection and quantification of cyclic di-GMPThe method for detection and quantification of cyclic di-GMPfrom X. campestris or P. aeruginosa strains was adaptedfrom Simm and colleagues (2004; 2005).

Mutation of PA2752 but not PA4108 or PA4781 hasan effect on the production of rhamnolipid in culture super-natants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The level of rhamno-lipid in culture supernatants of strains grown in PPGASmedium was measured as described by Boles and col-leagues (2005). Complementation of the PA2572 mutantreduces rhamnolipid production back to wild-type levels.Fig. S4.

(D) Twitching motility on CAA medium solidified with0.5% agar at pH 7.4 is also only affected in strain 16841.Fig. S6. The negative influence of expression of PA2572with a Cterminal truncation on swarming motility is also seenin a PA2572 mutant background. Swarming motility (A and B)and swimming motility (C and D) were assessed in theP. aeruginosa wild-type mPA01 and mutant strain 8166,these strains carrying the cloning vector pBBRMCS5(labelled as vector) and these strains carrying a constructexpressing the C-terminally truncated PA2572 protein(labelled as Insert). Introduction of pTRUN into mPA01 andstrain 8166 influences swarming motility over that seen withthe vector control (A and B) but has no effect on swimmingcompared with a vector control (C and D). Note that thepBBRMCS5 vector alone has an influence on both forms ofmotility. Shown are representatives of swimming and swarm-ing plates after 18 h of incubation.Fig. S7. Expression of the isolated REC domain of PA2572in mPAO1 does not influence swarming motility. (A) The RECdomain of PA2572 expressed using pBBRMCS-5 does notgive the swarming-negative phenotype in a P. aeruginosamPAO1 or in strain 8166 (shown). Introduction of the RECdomain with a His6 tag expressed using pLAFR3 gave thesame result. This contrasts with the effects seen with expres-sion of REC-YN-GYP (the truncated PA2572) using pTRUN,which gives substantially reduced swarming (see Fig. S5).(B) Western blot analysis with an anti-His6 antiserum showsthat both the REC domain and REC-YN-GYP domainproteins are expressed in mPAO1.
