IntroductionLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males inapan [1]. Despite development of a therapeutic strategy, improve-ents in prognosis remain unsatisfactory. Early diagnosis can leado better prognosis: 5-year survival is 83.9% at pathologic stageA but only 66.3% at stage IB, according to a recent report of theapanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry [2]. Aspects ofancer progression, such as regional lymph node involvement oristant metastasis, are observed in over two-thirds of patients atiagnosis [3]. Extrathoracic metastases are present in 13% of lungancer patients with small sized primary lesions (smaller thancm) [4].

Mina53 is detected by immunohistochemistryusing anti-Mina53 monoclonal antibody [5\u201310]. To assess theinvolvement of Mina53 in lung cancer, we examined its expressionin lung cancer tissues. We previously demonstrated that Mina53is overexpressed in 62% of lung cancer patients from the earlyclinical stages (manuscript submitted). In addition, the enforcedexpression of Mina53 in NIH/3T3 cells induces cell transforma-tion, and mina53 transfected NIH/3T3 clones produce tumors innude mice, suggesting that Mina53 has oncogenic potential. Thedifferentially expressed genes examined by a cDNA microarrayshowed that Mina53 regulates several genes related with cell adhe-sion, metabolism, and cytokine/growth factors such as epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepatocytegrowth factor (HGF). These results suggest that Mina53 plays animportant role in carcinogenesis associated with the cytokine net-work.Generally, patients in the early stage of lung cancer have goodprognosis following radical resection: 5-year survival is 83.9% atpathologic stage IA. Nevertheless, approximately 20% of lung cancerpatients with stage IA show local recurrence or distant metastasis.Therefore, identifying patients at high risk of recurrence amonghttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002http://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcanmailto:sueokan@cc.saga-u.ac.jpdx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2009.10.010CancetiIiwpa22lMtpmsmoAfAsc2ptbptaaMc[utwsas\u22126ntcK2s2mipbcdoCK.

These results suggest that Mina53 may useful for riskssessment in early stage lung cancer patients.. Materials and methods.1. Tissue samples and lung cancer cell linesTissue samples were obtained from surgical specimens of 101ung cancer patients. Study patients underwent treatment at Sagaedical School Hospital with surgery but no chemotherapy orhoracic irradiation. The population was a consecutive series ofatients treated between 1998 and 2000. Clinical stage was deter-ined by criteria of the International Union Against Cancer. Thetudy protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Com-ittee of Saga University and all patients gave informed consent forbtaining surgical specimens. Human lung cancer cell lines H226B,549, and a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3 were purchasedrom American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). H226B, and549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovineerum at 37 \u25e6C in 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in DMEMontaining 10% fetal bovine serum..2. Immunohistochemical stainingImmunohistochemical analysis with anti-Mina53 antibody waserformed as follows. For antigen retrieval, deparaffinized 4 \ufffdm-hin tissue sections were microwaved in 0.01 M sodium citrateuffer (pH 6.0). After tissue sections were blocked with 3% hydrogeneroxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room tempera-ure, each section was incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C with anti-Mina53ntibody, at a dilution of 1:500, and MIB-1 mouse monoclonalntibody against Ki-67 (DAKO Co., Carpinteria, CA), at 1:100. Anti-ina53 monoclonal antibody was established using a hybridomalone, M532, secreting an IgG2a antibody as described previously5]. A DAKO ENVISSION system (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) wassed for detection. Counter-staining was performed with hema-oxylin. Immunohistochemical examination with each antibodyas evaluated by the following criteria and scored according toequential arbitrary cutoffs. Staining of the cancer cell nuclei withnti-Mina53 antibody in whole tissue section, with no remarkabletaining of parenchymal cells, was taken as positive and scored as(0\u201310% positive cells), \u00b1 (10\u201330%), + (30\u201360%), or ++ (more than0%). The Ki-67 labeling index was defined as the percentage ofuclear-stained cells among at least 1000 tumor cells for each sec-ion; representative areas in each tissue section were selected andells were counted in at least four fields in these areas (score \u2212,i-67 labeling index from 0 to 10%; score \u00b1, 11 to/25%; score +,6 to/50%; score ++, more than 50%). All slides were concomitantlycored by three researchers..3. Transient transfection of mina53 expression plasmid andina53 shRNAThe 1.5-kb HindIII/NotI fragment of mina53 cDNA was ligatednto the NheI/NotI site of pCAGGS mammalian expression vector toroduce pCAGGS/mina53 [4,11]. The cDNA fragment was obtainedy PCR (GeneAmp 9600, PerkinElmer) using a cDNA library of HELells as described previously [4]. One day after seeding in 10 cmishes, 5 \u00d7 105 cells were transfected with the indicated amountf pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen,orp. CA). After 30 h of incubation in complete medium, westernr 69 (2010) 232\u2013238 233blot analysis was performed to determine the Mina53 expres-sion. The mina53 shRNA construct was established as follows. Toobtain human U6 siRNA vector based on pcDNA3, the human U6promoter, which contains the cloning sites HindIII and BamHI,was amplified from human genomic DNA with primer pairs 5\u2032-AGATCTGAATTCCCCAGTGGAAAGACGCGCAGGC and 5\u2032-AGATCTA-AGCTTCTCGAGGATCCCGCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAACCCAAG,then ligated into the BglII site of pcDNA3. To construct thepcDNA3-GFP-hU6 siRNA vector, GFP cDNA fragment obtainedfrom pEGFP-N3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, CA)was ligated into the multi-cloning site of human U6 siRNA vector.The partial DNA fragments of human mina53 DNA were chemicallysynthesized and cloned into pcDNA3-GFP-hU6siRNA cleaved withHindIII and BamHI to produce pU6shmina53(892)/GFP. The syn-thesized DNAs for pU6shmina53(892)/GFP were 5\u2032-GATCCCCAGG-TGGAATCCACAACTGTTTTC AAGAGAAACAGTTGTGGATTCCACCT-GTTTTTGGAAG and 5\u2032-AGCTCTTCCAAAAACAGGTGGAATCCACAA-CTGTTTCTCTTGAAAACAGTTGTGGATTCCACCTGGG. Transfectionwas performed in the same way as with the mina53 expressionplasmid.2.4. Western blot analysisWhole cell lysates were prepared from lung cancer cell linesor cancer tissues using lysis buffer containing Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0),150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1%sodium deoxycholate, 1 \ufffdg/ml leupeptin, 10 \ufffdg/ml aptrotinin, and1 mM phenolmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fifty micrograms of pro-tein were separated using a 10% NuPAGE electrophoresis system(NOVEX, San Diego, CA), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane(Schleicher & Schell, Inc., Keene, NH), blocked with 5% milk at 4 \u25e6Covernight, and then reacted with anti-Mina53 or anti-Actin (SantaCruz Biotechnology, CA) antibodies. An ECL kit (Amersham Corp.,Arlington Heights, IL) was used for detection.2.5. Analysis of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosisCells were transiently transfected by the indicated amount ofpCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, then counted using trypan blue stain-ing. After 5 \u00d7 103 cells were cultured, the number of cells wascounted at the indicated point in time. The experiments wereundertaken three times. The analysis of cell cycle was performedas follows. At the indicated time following transient transfectionof A549 cells with pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, both floating andadherent cells were collected by trypsinization and fixed with 2%paraformaldehyde followed by 70% ethanol. Cells were treated withRNase A (0.25 mg/ml) at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min and stained with pro-pidium iodine (50 \ufffdg/ml). Cellular DNA content was analyzed byflow cytometry and the cell cycle profiles were determined withCELLQuestTM software (Becton Dickinson, NJ). As for analysis ofapoptosis, cells were simultaneously stained with Annexin V andpropidium iodide (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according tothe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Stained cells were conducted to aFACS analysis to determine the number of apoptotic cells.2.6. In vitro cell invasion assayThe in vitro cell invasion assay was performed usingBD BioCoat\u00ae Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences,Franklin Lakes, NJ). Twenty-four hours after transfection withpCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, 1.0 \u00d7 105 cells were added to each ofthe upper chambers with serum-free growth medium, whereas thelower wells contained growth medium with 5% FBS. After an addi-tional 22 h of incubation, non-invading cells on the upper side ofthe chamber membranes were removed. Cells invading the oppo-site side of the chamber membranes were examined.

Positive immunostaining with anti-Mina53 antibodyrequently observed in early stage lung cancerClinicopathological characteristics of the 101 lung canceratients are summarized in Table 1. A representative case ofmmunostaining with anti-Mina53 antibody is shown in Fig. 1.ositive staining of Mina53 was detected in nuclei, especially inucleoli, in lung cancer tissue, but staining levels were low indjacent non-cancerous tissue. Sixty-three (62%) of the patientshowed positive staining (+ or ++) for Mina53 immunohistochem-stry. By gender, smoking status, and subtype, proportions showingositive staining were: 38/66 (58%) among males, 25/35 (71%)mong females; 37/63 (59%) among smokers, 26/38 (68%) amongon-smokers; and 36/56 (64%) among adenocarcinomas, 20/3263%) among squamous cell carcinomas. None of these differ-nces was statistically significant.

In additiono Mina53 expression, possible prognostic factors, including sex,ge, pathological stage, positivity for c-Myc, and labeling index ofi-67, were analyzed.

Pathological stage predicted poor survival(P = 0.002), whereas Mina53 positivity predicted favorable survival(P = 0.020).3.3. Effects of Mina53 on cell proliferation of a non-small cell lungcancer cell line or non-transformed cellsBecause Mina53 positivity predicted favorable outcome in lungcancer patients, we next examined the effect of Mina53 on cellproliferation. Mina53 was detected in non-small lung cancer celllines, A549, and H226B, but was present only negligibly in NIH/3T3cells (Figs. 3 and 5A). Following transfection of pCAGGS/mina53into lung cancer cell lines, protein levels of Mina53 reached a peakafter two days and gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 3A). Thepattern of Mina53 expression was different in NIH/3T3 cells; theprotein level was sustained for five days following transfection(Fig. 3B). Growth rates of lung cancer cell lines were not stimu-lated by transfection with pCAGGS/mina53; in fact, growth of A549was inhibited (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, the growth rate of NIH/3T3cells transfected with pCAGGS/mina53 was not altered comparedto those with pCAGGS (Fig. 3B). To investigate the mechanisms ofreduced growth rate in A549, cell cycle analysis was performedusing FACS analyses.

DiscussionOur study revealed an overexpression of Mina53 in lung cancerpatients in the early clinical stages that is associated with favorableprognosis, especially in stage I or with squamous cell carcinomapatients. On the other hand, Mina53 expression has been associatedwith poor prognosis in esophageal cancer, renal cell carcinoma,and neuroblastoma [8\u201310]. In the present study, death from lungcancer was associated with distant metastasis to areas such as thebrain, bone, and intrapulmonary regions. Therefore, we hypothe-sized that Mina53 exerts different effects according to cancer celltype, inhibiting tumor progression in lung cancer cells.Transient transfection of Mina53 into A549 cells dose-dependently inhibited cell growth, whereas that into H226B orNIH/3T3 cells did not produce any effects. Because we previouslyreported that cell transformation and tumorigenicity are inducedin NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing Mina53, it is possible that cellsoverexpressing Mina53 develop the potential for clonal expansion.d time after transient transfection with pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS into A549 cells,determined as described in Section 2.

These results suggest thathe growth stimulation effect of mina53 differs by cell type, and thatina53 induces cell growth inhibition associated with apoptosisniquely in a lung cancer cell line.With H226B (a squamous lung cancer cell line), althoughina53 overexpression did not induce apoptosis, it inhibited cellnvasion.

Numbers of migrating cells (B) and invading cef Mina53 in H226B cells were determined by western blotting at the indicated timero cell invasion assay was performed using H226B cells 24 h after transfection withof the chamber membranes were observed by May Giemsa Staining (B). Numbersity and invasiveness are well known prerequisites for metastasis.Resistance to microenvironmental death signals, such as nutri-ent deprivation and hypoxia, is also important. It is possible thatMina53 inhibits distant metastasis mediated through inhibition ofcell invasion and induction of apoptosis, resulting in a favorableoutcome in lung cancer patients having Mina53 overexpression.Mina53 was originally identified in the human glioblastoma cellline, T98G, using the estrogen-inducible c-Myc system to condi-tionally activate c-Myc protein. Mina53 contains a JmjC domainin the amino acid sequence 128-271 [5]. JmjC domain-containingproteins were first predicted to be metalloenzymes that regulatetein levels of Mina53 in H226B cells were determined by western blotting at thein vitro cell invasion assay was performed using H226B cells 24 h after transfectionlls (C) are shown.2 Cancecsotsmea[btOtlttsshTp5OtcrclspCAcRAt[[[[[[[[[[[38 K. Komiya et al. / Lunghromatin remodeling [13]. Modification of histone methylationhowed either transcriptional activation or repression, dependingn the lysine residue and methylation status. In connection withhis function, JmjC domain-containing proteins have both tumor-uppressor and oncogenic functions in a JmjC domain-dependentanner [14\u201318]. For example, JHDM1B/FBXL10 has a negativeffect on cell size and cell proliferation of HeLa cells, which may bessociated with repression of transcription of ribosomal RNA genes19]. In addition, JHDM1B/FBXL10 expression is low in aggressiverain tumors, glioblastoma multiform, relative to normal brainissue, and expression levels are associated with tumor grade.n the contrary, JHDM1B/FBXL10 and JHDM1A/FBXL11 both con-ribute to induction and/or progression of MoMuLV-induced T cellymphomas in rodents and overexpression of either protein immor-alizes mouse embryonic fibroblasts [20]. They have been reportedo have histone demethylase activity and to regulate gene expres-ion [14,15]. Recently, mdig, a gene identical to mina53, has beenhown to be involved in demethylation of tri-methyl lysine 9 onistone H3, resulting in increased ribosomal RNA expression [21].hese results suggest that JmjC domain-containing mina53/mdigroteins have varying functions depending on tissue and cell type.. ConclusionsWe show that Mina53 function varies according to cell type.verexpression in non-transformed cells induces cell transforma-ion and tumorigenicity, whereas overexpression in lung cancerells inhibits cell invasion and induces apoptosis. Considering theseesults, it is possible that the role of Mina53 differs between cancerells and non-transformed cells, as well as with cell type. In overtung cancer, Mina53 inhibits distant metastasis, so clarifying theignaling of Mina53 could be helpful in developing a strategy forreventing or limiting cancer progression.onflict of interestNone declared.cknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Edu-ation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the Smokingesearch Foundation.ppendix A.
