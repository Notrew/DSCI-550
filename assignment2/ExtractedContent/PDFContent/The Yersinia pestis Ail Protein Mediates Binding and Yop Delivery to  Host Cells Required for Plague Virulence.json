Krukonis1,2*Department of Biologic and Materials Sciences, University of Michigan School of Dentistry,1 and Department of Microbiology andImmunology, University of Michigan School of Medicine,2 Ann Arbor, MichiganReceived 23 July 2008/Returned for modification 22 August 2008/Accepted 25 November 2008Although adhesion to host cells is a critical step in the delivery of cytotoxic Yop proteins by Yersinia pestis,the mechanism has not been defined. To identify adhesins critical for Yop delivery, we initiated two transposonmutagenesis screens using the mariner transposon. To avoid redundant cell binding activities, we initiated thescreen with a strain deleted for two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and the autotransporter, YapC, as well asthe Caf1 capsule, which is known to obscure some adhesins. The mutants that emerged contained insertionswithin the ail (attachment and invasion locus) gene of Y. pestis. A reconstructed mutant with a single deletionin the ail locus (y1324) was severely defective for delivery of Yops to HEp-2 human epithelial cells andsignificantly defective for delivery of Yops to THP-1 human monocytes. Specifically, the Yop delivery defect wasapparent when cell rounding and translocation of an ELK-tagged YopE derivative into host cells weremonitored. Although the ail mutant showed only a modest decrease in cell binding capacity in vitro, the KIM5\ufffdail mutant exhibited a >3,000-fold-increased 50% lethal dose in mice. Mice infected with the \ufffdail mutant alsohad 1,000-fold fewer bacteria in their spleens, livers, and lungs 3 days after infection than did those infectedwith the parental strain, KIM5. Thus, the Ail protein is critical for both Y. pestis type III secretion in vitro andinfection in mice.Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, employs a typeIII secretion system (T3SS) to deliver cytotoxic Yop proteinsinto host cells (16). Yops have various cell-altering activities,including Rho-GAP activity (YopE) (6, 64), tyrosine phos-phatase activity (YopH) (9), serine/threonine kinase activity(YpkA) (23), and protease activity (YopT) (56), and the abilityto disrupt MAP kinase signaling pathways via acetylation ofMAP kinases (YopJ) (44\u201346). A sixth Yop, YopM, leads todisruption of the immune system via depletion of NK cells(26). The injection of Yops into host cells by the Ysc T3SS ofpathogenic Yersinia species is required for virulence (49). Mu-tants lacking the Yop-encoding virulence plasmid are avirulentby all routes of entry, as are mutants unable to assemble afunctioning T3SS for Yop delivery (49). An essential step forsecretion of type III effector proteins is host cell binding. Thisdocking step is required for pathogens to deliver a cargo ofcell-altering effector proteins. In the case of enteropathogenicYersinia species, at least two adhesins are capable of mediatingT3SS delivery of Yops, invasin and YadA (53). Both of theseproteins are inactive in Y. pestis, due to an insertion element orframeshift mutation, respectively (20, 48, 54, 57). One knownY. pestis adhesin, pH 6 antigen, restores adhesion and T3SSdelivery of ExoS when heterologously expressed in a nonad-herent mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60). pH 6 antigencan also fulfill this T3SS docking function in Y. pestis (S. Felekand E. S. Krukonis, unpublished). However, pH 6 antigen isonly expressed under certain environmental conditions (\ufffd35\u00b0Cand pH of \ufffd6.7) (5), a pH 6 antigen mutant has a modestdefect in virulence via the intravenous, subcutaneous, or intra-nasal routes of infection (14, 32), and the expression of pH 6antigen in a mouse model of fully virulent pneumonic plague isgreatly downregulated (31). Thus, identification of the ad-hesins required for Y. pestis Yop delivery is still a priority.Recently, the Y. pestis Ail protein was also shown to mediatecell binding, cell invasion, bacterial autoaggregation, and se-rum resistance (3, 28). This finding was somewhat surprising,since Y. pestis Ail is nearly identical to Yersinia pseudotubercu-losis Ail, which has been reported to confer serum resistancebut not play a role in adhesion or invasion of tissue culture cells(67). On the other hand, in Yersinia enterocolitica, Ail mediatesattachment and invasion of host cells and confers serum resis-tance to the bacterium (8, 40, 50). Ail of Y. enterocolitica showssome cell selectivity allowing interaction with HEp-2 and CHOcells, but not MDCK cells (40). Ail is an outer membraneprotein of the OmpX family, proposed to have eight mem-brane-spanning domains and four extracellular loops (22, 63).The role of these loops has been extensively studied in Y.enterocolitica Ail. Mutations in either loop 2 or 3 were found toaffect serum resistance, adhesion/invasion, or both activities(39). Furthermore, a peptide derived from a sequence withinloop 2 of Y. enterocolitica Ail was able to disrupt invasion ofCHO cells (39).While many researchers have used nonphagocytic cells astargets of Yop secretion to identify adhesin molecules (11, 53),Yop delivery to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages andneutrophils, may be adhesin independent, since the bacteriacan be readily engulfed by these host cells (11). During Yopdelivery to phagocytic cells, the pore-forming translocon mol-ecules YopB and YopD of the T3SS apparatus may serve as acholesterol-binding docking complex, by analogy to other ho-mologous T3SSs (25).

In tissue culture models of infection, wedemonstrate that Y. pestis Ail mediates cell attachment andfacilitates Yop delivery to a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2)and a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). In mouse infections,Ail is critical for virulence, as reflected by the \ufffd3,000-foldincrease in the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the \ufffdail mutant.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial strains and culture conditions. Y. pestis strains were cultivated inheart infusion broth (HIB) overnight or on heart infusion agar (HIA) for 48 h at28\u00b0C. Escherichia coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LBagar at 28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations:streptomycin (Sm), 100 \ufffdg/ml; kanamycin (Km), 30 \ufffdg/ml; chloramphenicol(Cm), 10 \ufffdg/ml; and ampicillin (Amp), 100 \ufffdg/ml. Isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopy-ranoside (IPTG) was used at a 100 \ufffdM concentration. Strain KIM5-3001 (Table1), an Sm-resistant version of KIM5, is hereafter referred to as KIM5 in the text,for simplicity.Transposon mutagenesis and identification of ail. We previously observed thatthe deletion of two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and YapC, does not abolishthe ability of Y. pestis to bind to eukaryotic cells when it is grown at 28\u00b0C (21). Tofind other potential adhesins in Y. pestis, we performed a random transposonmutagenesis by using a Y. pestis KIM5 \ufffdpsaA \ufffdyapC \ufffdcaf1 mutant strain. Weused a caf1 mutant to exclude the masking effect of capsule during cell bindingenrichment steps (33). The strain was conjugated with E. coli SM10(\ufffdpir)/pFD1harboring the mariner transposon (55) and then selected for Sm resistance (Y.pestis) and Km resistance (mariner transposon).Mutant pools were then used to serially infect HEp-2 cells in 24-well tissueculture plates six times per day for 3 days (18 rounds of enrichment). For eachday of infection, the bacteria were put in the first well at a multiplicity of infection(MOI) of 100 and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 \ufffd g to facilitate bacterial contactwith the HEp-2 cells; infections were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Theunbound bacteria from the previous binding step were transferred to the nextwell, centrifuged, and incubated, as described above. After six rounds of enrich-ment, unbound bacteria were collected, cultured overnight in HIB at 28\u00b0C, andused for more enrichment the next day. We also performed an erythrocytebinding enrichment three times per day for 3 days. Sheep erythrocytes wereincubated with mutant pools, incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, and centrifuged at 800rpm in a microcentrifuge for 3 min, and supernatants were mixed with newerythrocytes. After the last enrichment, unbound bacteria were collected andcultured overnight in HIB at 28\u00b0C and used for more enrichment the next day.To identify the gene disrupted by mariner transposition, the insertion regionwas amplified with primers Mariner-1 (5\t-GGCCACGCGTGCACTAGTACNNNNNNNNNNTACNG-3\t) and SFMar2 (5\t-TACGGTATCGATAAGC), andPCR products were purified (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and subjected to asecond nested PCR by using primers SFMar3 (5\t-CACGCGTGCACTAGTAC-3\t) and SFMar4 (5\t-AATCATTTGAAGGTTGGTAC-3\t). Final PCR productswere purified and sequenced by the University of Michigan Sequencing Core byusing sequencing primer SFMarseq (5\t-ACGCCATCTATGTGTCAGAC-3\t).Deletion of ail. Gene deletion in Y. pestis KIM5 was performed as previouslydescribed (18, 21, 68). Briefly, the pKD4 Km resistance cassette was amplified byPCR with primers aildf (5\t-ATTTTTCATGTGTCAGATATTTGTTAATATTTGGCTGGCCACTTTAGTCTTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3\t) and aildr (5\t-TCAGCAATTTGAAACCACCATTATGGTGGGTTTTCATGGTTAGGAGGACGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3\t). PCR products were purified and di-gested with DpnI and then transformed into Y. pestis KIM5, which had been previ-ously transformed with pKD46 and induced with arabinose. Km-resistant colonieswere selected, and the deletion of ail was confirmed by PCR with primers ailf1(5\t-TCAATGGGGCTATTGATTTCG-3\t) and ailr1 (5\t-GGTGACTTGCTCGAAATAATG-3\t). Replacement of ail with this cassette results in a complete deletion ofail (all 585 bp). The strain was then transformed with pCP20 to resolve out the Kmresistance cassette. This resolution results in an 82- to 85-nucleotide FLP recombi-nation target site scar in the place of ail (18). Plasmids were cured from the strainsby growing in HIB at 28\u00b0C and screening for Amp sensitivity. The \ufffdail mutant grewidentically to the starting strain, KIM5, in HIB at 28\u00b0C. It grew slightly faster thanKIM5 at 37\u00b0C in HIB and minimal essential medium (Fig. 1).Cloning of ail. The gene encoding Ail was amplified from Y. pestis KIM5 withPCR by using primers ailcf1 (5\t-GCGCGGATCCTTGGCTGGCCACTTTAGTCT-3\t) and ailcr1 (5\t-GCGCCTGCAGGGTTAGGAGGACGTTAGAAC-3\t).Amplification primers for cloning were designed to include the ribosomal bind-ing site of ail. PCR products were purified and digested with BamHI and PstI, gelpurified, and ligated into pMMB207 (43). The sequences of clones containing theinsert were confirmed. To construct pIV2-ail, pMMB207-ail was digested withBamHI and PstI, and the band harboring ail was gel purified and then ligatedinto the BamHI- and PstI-digested pIV2 plasmid. The KIM5 \ufffdail mutant strainwas transformed with pMMB207-ail and pIV2-ail or empty vectors for comple-mentation studies.SDS-PAGE. Deletion and complementation of ail were confirmed by sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Briefly, Y. pes-tis KIM5 and derivative strains were grown overnight in HIB containing Sm at28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. For pMMB207-containing strains, 100 \ufffdM IPTG and Cm wereTABLE 1.

Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer tonormalize for optical densities at 620 nm (OD620s), boiled for 5 min, and thensubjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining.Adhesion and invasion assays. HEp-2 and THP-1 cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates until reaching 100% and 60% confluence, respectively.THP-1 cells were activated with 10 pg/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for3 days to stimulate attachment to 24-well plates. Y. pestis KIM5 or E. coliderivatives were cultured overnight at 28\u00b0C (100 \ufffdM IPTG and Cm was addedfor the strains containing pMMB207). Tissue culture cells were washed twicewith 1 ml of serum-free minimal essential medium (for HEp-2 cells) or RPMI1640 (for THP-1 cells) and infected with the bacterial strains at an MOI of 100(Y. pestis) or 500 (E. coli) bacteria per cell. For THP-1 cells, the cells werepretreated with 5 \ufffdg/ml cytochalasin D for 45 min prior to infection to inhibitphagocytosis. This blocked phagocytosis and decreased cellular uptake by 100-fold (49% decreased to 0.47%) as assessed by a gentamicin protection assay. Forthe adhesion assay, plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells werethen washed, and cell-associated bacteria were liberated by the addition of sterileH2O containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Serial dilutions of samples wereplated onto HIA or LB agar for CFU analysis. In parallel wells, the entirepopulation of bacteria was harvested and enumerated by dilution and CFUanalysis to determine the total number of bacteria per well. Percent adhesion wascalculated by dividing bound CFU by total bacteria in the well at the end of 2hours of incubation and then multiplying by 100. Presented data are from threeexperiments performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using theStudent t test (n \ufffd 6).Invasion assays were performed similarly except that at the end of 2 hours ofbacterial binding, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)to remove unbound bacteria and minimal essential medium containing 7.5 \ufffdg/mlgentamicin was added for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 to kill extracellular bacteria.Cells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed and plated as described for theadhesion assay.Cytotoxicity assay. HEp-2 cells were cultivated until they reached about 50%confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates. Y. pestis KIM5 and derivative strainswere cultured in HIB overnight at 28\u00b0C. Cultures were diluted to an OD620 of0.15 in HIB and incubated for 3 to 4 more hours at 28\u00b0C. Plates were washed twotimes with 2 ml of serum-free tissue culture medium, and bacteria were added toeach well at an MOI of 10. IPTG (100 \ufffdM) was added to tissue culture mediumto induce ail expression. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Rounding wasobserved, and pictures were taken under a phase-contrast microscope at 0, 2, 4,and 8 h.Yop delivery assay. KIM5 derivatives carrying a YopE-Elk-encoding plasmid(pYopE129-Elk) (19) were cultivated overnight in HIB at 28\u00b0C, diluted to anOD620 of 0.15 in HIB, and incubated for 3 to 4 more hours at 28\u00b0C. HEp-2 orTHP-1 cells were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates until they reached100% or 60% confluence, respectively. Each well was washed two times withserum-free tissue culture medium, and bacteria were added at an MOI of 10 inthe presence of 100 \ufffdM IPTG (to induce yopE-ELK and ail expression). Thebacteria were allowed to interact and translocate Yops for 2 to 8 h. Cells werethen directly lysed in 100 \ufffdl of 1.5\ufffd Laemmli sample buffer containing proteaseinhibitor cocktail (Sigma P-8340) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (SigmaP-2850), combined with bacteria from the tissue culture medium supernatant,and boiled for 5 min. Extracts (7.5 \ufffdl) were run for Western blot analysis andprobed with anti-ELK or anti-phospho-ELK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technol-ogy, Danvers, MA). Cells deleted for yopB served as a negative control for Yopdelivery, since YopB is part of the T3SS translocation pore and is required forYop delivery.Mouse experiments. To find the median lethal dose (LD50), 6- to 8-week-oldfemale Swiss Webster mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) wereinoculated intravenously (i.v.) via tail vein injection with 5- to 10-fold-increasedconcentrations of each strain. Each bacterial strain group consisted of threedifferent doses and 10 mice in each dose. Mice were observed daily for 16 daysfor survival. For the pCD1-negative KIM5 avirulent mutant, only five mice wereinfected with a single dose of 106 bacteria. Experiments were performed inaccordance with the University of Michigan UCUCA guidelines. Bacteria formouse inoculation were grown overnight at 28\u00b0C in HIB medium.For tissue analysis experiments, 10 mice were inoculated with about 100bacteria i.v. (10 LD50s) and euthanized with CO2 at day 1, 2, 3, or 7. Spleen, liver,and lung tissues were removed and weighed, and samples were divided into twoparts. One part was homogenized, and serial dilutions were plated for CFU. Theother part was fixed in formalin for histology. Data presented are from twoexperiments (20 mice per strain per time point). Histological sections and stain-ing were done at the University of Michigan Dental School Core HistologyLaboratory.Statistical analysis. Adhesion data, invasion data, and spleen weights of themice were analyzed with Student\u2019s t test. Tissue colonization levels were analyzedusing a two-tailed two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test.RESULTSTransposon mutagenesis and enrichment identify Ail as adominant adhesin of Y. pestis. To identify novel bacterial pro-teins that equip Y. pestis to bind host cells, we initiated ourenrichment strategy with a KIM5 strain lacking two previouslydescribed adhesins of Y. pestis\u2014pH 6 antigen (\ufffdpsaA) (67) andthe putative autotransporter YapC (\ufffdyapC) (21). This strainmaintains wild-type levels of adhesion. Thus, this mutantscreen was designed to identify redundant adhesins of Y. pestis.Since Y. pestis can become nonadherent due to mutations re-sulting in constitutive expression of the Caf1 capsule (Krukonisand Felek, unpublished observations), the caf1 locus was alsodeleted from our KIM5 \ufffdpsaA \ufffdyapC starting strain. Threepools of \ufffd1,000,000 Y. pestis mutants (\ufffd3,000,000 total mu-tants) with random mariner transposon insertions were gener-ated (55). The pools were subjected to two independent en-richment strategies. In the first, bacterial cells were allowed tobind HEp-2 cells for 1 h, and then nonadherent bacteria wereremoved and used to infect a fresh well of HEp-2 cells for 1 h.This panning procedure was repeated for six rounds/day for 3days (18 rounds of enrichment).The other enrichment strategy took advantage of the factthat Y. pestis can agglutinate sheep red blood cells when grownat 28\u00b0C; at 37\u00b0C, this activity is blocked by expression of theCaf1 capsule (Krukonis and Felek, unpublished observations).Bacterial cells were incubated with sheep erythrocytes for 2 hat 37\u00b0C in PBS (our strain for mutagenesis was a \ufffdcaf1 mu-tant), and then the erythrocytes were pelleted gently in a mi-crocentrifuge. Nonadherent Y. pestis bacteria were then mixedwith fresh red blood cells, and the enrichment procedure wasrepeated three times/day for 3 days (nine rounds of enrich-ment).After either enrichment, we noticed that a vast majority ofKIM5 mutant derivatives had an altered colony morphology(larger, more opaque, rough colony edges) (Fig. 1A). Genomicsequencing of three of these mutants identified the locus of themariner insertion as the ail gene of Y. pestis (20). Ail has beendefined previously in pathogenic Yersinia species as mediatingcell attachment and invasion as well as serum resistance (3, 28,40, 67). Homologues of Ail in other genera have also beenreferred to as an opacity factor, since deletion of the locusresults in an altered colony morphology phenotype (7). Oneother sequenced mutant that emerged from this screen (with anormal colony morphology) had an insertion in the gene en-coding the regulatory protein DeoR. We have not character-ized this mutant further.To assess the specific importance of ail in our parentalstrain, we next constructed a targeted single-deletion ail mu-tant of Y. pestis KIM5. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue stain-ing confirmed that the Ail protein was lacking in the recon-structed \ufffdail mutant and that it could be complemented by ailexpressed from the broad-host-range plasmid pMMB207 (Fig.1E) (43). Targeted ail mutants also had an altered colonymorphology. Despite the altered colony morphology, KIM5828 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT. IMMUN.and the \ufffdail mutant had similar growth kinetics in HIB andtissue culture medium (Fig. 1B to D).The ail mutant showed an approximately twofold reductionin cell binding to HEp-2 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 2A and B,respectively) compared to the parental strain, KIM5. THP-1cell adhesion assays were performed in the presence of 5 \ufffdg/mlcytochalasin D to inhibit phagocytosis. A freshly reconstructed\ufffdcaf1 \ufffdpsaA \ufffdyapC \ufffdail mutant also showed a (35%) defect inadhesion relative to the \ufffdcaf1 \ufffdpsaA \ufffdyapC starting strain formutagenesis (data not shown). We interpret this to mean thatwhile Ail may be a dominant adhesin in our KIM5 \ufffdpsaA\ufffdyapC \ufffdcaf1 mutant (allowing it to be enriched to the exclu-sion of other adhesin mutants), additional redundant adhesinsmust also be present. Expression of Ail in the heterologoushost, E. coli AAEC185 (fim negative), also facilitated bindingto both HEp-2 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 2C and D, respectively).Some of the HEp-2 cell-associated bacteria were likely in-ternalized in this assay, since Y. pestis is known to invade tissueculture cells (17, 28). However, based on our analysis of KIM5invasion of HEp-2 cells, about 60% of adhered bacteria remainextracellular (compare Fig. 2A and Fig. 2E). Deletion of ailresults in only a modest decrease in invasion frequency (P \ufffd0.1) (Fig. 2E). Giemsa staining of infected cells also indicatedthat many of the bacteria remain at the cell periphery, andsome even appear to be associated with the extracellular matrix(Fig. 3).Ail is important for Yop delivery to host cells. One of thecritical steps in Y. pestis pathogenesis is the delivery of Yopproteins. In the absence of Yops, all pathogenic Yersinia spe-cies are completely avirulent (49). We next assessed the role ofAil in Yop delivery to both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cellsby using human monocytes (THP-1 cells) and human epithelialcells (HEp-2 cells). Yop delivery was measured by assessingdelivery and phosphorylation of ELK-tagged YopE from theKIM5 \ufffdail mutant, compared to the parental strain, KIM5.ELK is an epitope tag from the eukaryotic transcription factorElk-1 that is normally phosphorylated by MAP kinase (37) orstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal proteinkinase (JNK) (15).Upon infection of HEp-2 cells with KIM5, phosphorylatedELK-YopE could be detected within 2 hours. However, for theKIM5 \ufffdail mutant, no Yop delivery was detected even by 8hours (Fig. 4A). In THP-1 human monocytes, phospho-ELK-YopE was detected upon KIM5 infection by 2 hours, but notFIG. 2. Adhesion and invasion of Y. pestis derivatives or E. coli expressing ail to HEp-2 or THP-1 cells. HEp-2 (A, C, and E) and THP-1 (Band D) cells were infected with Y. pestis derivatives (A and B) or E. coli AAEC185 derivatives (C and D). Percent adhesion was calculated bydividing cell-associated CFU by the number of all bacteria in the well (bound plus unbound) and multiplying by 100.

HEp-2 cell invasion (E) was assessed after the additionof gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria for 1 h (P \ufffd 0.1; n \ufffd 6).VOL. 77, 2009 Ail PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR Yop DELIVERY 829detected until hour 4 in the \ufffdail mutant (Fig. 4B). YopE-ELKdelivery to THP-1 cells by the \ufffdail mutant at 4 hours was lessefficient than that by KIM5 (Fig. 4B). Complementation of the\ufffdail mutant with Ail expressed from an inducible plasmiddemonstrated that expression of Ail alone could restore Yopdelivery to the \ufffdail mutant (Fig. 4A and B). Expression of theentire pool of YopE-ELK (phosphorylated and unphosphory-lated) within bacterial cells and tissue culture cells was de-tected using an anti-ELK antibody (Fig. 4). Deletion of yopB (acomponent of the Yop translocation pore) completely pre-vented the ability of YopE-ELK to be translocated and phos-phorylated within host cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the yopB mutantserves as a negative control for YopE-ELK delivery. Thesedata indicate that Ail is an important adhesin for mediatingYop delivery in Y. pestis. These studies also demonstrate thatAil plays a role in Yop delivery to phagocytic cells, the primarytarget of Yops early in infection.The delay in Yop delivery to HEp-2 cells was also confirmedby monitoring Yop-mediated cytotoxicity as indicated by cellrounding (Fig. 5). Counting of 500 cells per infecting strainindicated that at hour 2, 90% of KIM5-infected cells hadrounded, yet only 5 to 10% of the \ufffdail mutant-infected cellswere rounded (Fig. 5B). By hour 4, some rounding was de-tected in HEp-2 cells infected with the \ufffdail mutant (25 to45%), and by hour 8, about 85% of cells infected with the \ufffdailmutant had undergone cell rounding (100% of KIM5-infectedcells were rounded at hour 8) (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the\ufffdail mutant is not completely attenuated for Yop delivery.Rounding of THP-1 cells was not evaluated, since they arequite round normally. Further rounding due to Yop deliverywas difficult to assess.Lack of Yop-mediated cytotoxicity was also seen in Giemsa-stained HEp-2 cells 2 hours after infection by the KIM5 \ufffdailmutant, as indicated by the failure of the mutant to causecytoplasmic shrinkage (Fig. 3).Ail plays a major role in Y. pestis virulence. Since the KIM5\ufffdail mutant was strongly defective for Yop delivery in vitro, wepredicted that it might be strongly attenuated for mouse viru-lence. We next assessed the role of Ail in a mouse infectionmodel. Since KIM5 derivatives are pigmentation negative(pgm) and cannot acquire iron readily in peripheral tissuesdue to lack of yersiniabactin (4, 13) encoded within the 102-kbpgm high-pathogenicity island (12), we used the i.v. route ofinfection. Three groups of 10 Swiss Webster mice were in-fected with 5- or 10-fold increasing doses of bacteria, and theFIG. 3. Giemsa staining of KIM5, the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant, and the complemented mutant binding to HEp-2 cells. The shrunken cytoplasm inKIM5-infected cells is indicative of Yop-mediated cytotoxicity. KIM5 lacking the Yop-encoding virulence plasmid, pCD1, does not mediatecytotoxicity.FIG. 4. The \ufffdail mutant is delayed for delivery of ELK-taggedYopE to the cytoplasm of host cells. HEp-2 (A) or THP-1 (B) cellswere infected with KIM5 derivatives carrying a YopE-Elk-encodingplasmid (pYopE129-Elk) (19) at an MOI of 10 in the presence of 100\ufffdM IPTG (to induce YopE-ELK and Ail expression). The bacteriawere allowed to interact and translocate Yops for 2 to 8 h. Westernblots were probed with anti-ELK (ELK) or anti-phospho-ELK (P-Elk)antibodies. Cells lacking yopB served as a negative control for Yopdelivery, since they lack a critical component of the T3SS translocationpore required for Yop delivery.830 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT. IMMUN.LD50 was determined and compared with either that of theKIM5 parental strain or that of a Yop-negative plasmid-curedderivative of KIM5 (pCD1). Whereas the LD50 of our wild-type KIM5 strain was calculated to be 10 or 7 bacteria in twoexperiments (Table 2) (52), the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant had anLD50 of 167,000 or 23,800 organisms in two experiments, a16,000- or 3,400-fold increase in the LD50, respectively. Thisstrong attenuation of the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant is consistent witha poor ability to deliver Yop proteins during animal infection.The lack of virulence of the \ufffdail mutant could also be partiallycomplemented in vivo by expressing ail from the Y. enteroco-litica-derived plasmid pIV2 (Table 2), which is stably main-tained in Yersinia strains for many generations without antibi-otic selection (59), indicating that the virulence defect in thisstrain is due to the lack of Ail protein. We suspect that theincomplete complementation of the \ufffdail mutant is due to poorexpression of ail from pIV2-ail at 28\u00b0C (Fig. 1E).KIM5 colonizes host tissue to much higher levels than doesthe KIM5 \ufffdail mutant. Due to the decrease in virulence of theKIM5 \ufffdail mutant, we analyzed the number of bacteria invarious mouse organs to assess colonization and/or clearanceof the infection. Mice were infected with 100 organisms ofeither KIM5 or the \ufffdail mutant (\ufffd10 LD50s for the KIM5parental strain). After 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, mice were eutha-nized, and bacteria were harvested from their spleens, livers,and lungs. Ten mice were used per strain at each time point,and the experiment was repeated once to give 20 mice per timepoint. At day 1, infection with the \ufffdail mutant showed similarnumbers of bacteria in the spleen (a blood-filtering organ)(Fig. 6). By day 2, infection with the \ufffdail mutant showed100-fold fewer bacteria/gram tissue in the spleen, liver, andlungs (P value of \ufffd0.00005 for all three tissues) (Fig. 6). Fi-nally, by day 3, the CFU of \ufffdail mutant was decreased by\ufffd1,000-fold in spleen, liver, and lung compared to that of theparental strain, KIM5 (Fig. 6). In fact, by day 3, some miceinfected with the \ufffdail mutant had now cleared the infectionfrom the spleen (Fig. 6). Mice infected with KIM5 typicallybegin to die on days 3 to 5, and all succumb to infection wheninfected with 10 LD50s. However, we could follow survivors ofinfection with the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant in this experiment. Al-most all such mice (all but one of the survivors) cleared theinfection from all three tissues by day 7 (Fig. 6). These dataindicate that although early in infection (day 1), the KIM5 \ufffdailmutant is present in the spleen at levels similar to those of theparental strain, KIM5, over the course of a weeklong infection,the \ufffdail mutant is gradually cleared from the host, while KIM5is able to replicate to high numbers and kill the host.Histology from day 3 of the infection revealed more immuneinfiltration and tissue damage/degradative debris during infec-tion with the \ufffdail mutant than during infection with KIM5,indicating that the \ufffdail mutant induced a more robust immuneresponse (Fig. 7). This is predicted if the delivery of immune-suppressing Yops is defective. Host tissues lacking pathology inthe presence of the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant had cleared the infec-tion, based on low CFU numbers from the same tissue sample(Fig. 7, panels D, F, J, and L), or the infection had not yetestablished high bacterial numbers in that tissue (Fig. 7, panelG). While many \ufffdail mutant infections had been cleared (Fig.7, panels D and F [spleen] and J and L [liver]), those that hadnot yet been cleared promoted robust immune infiltration thatFIG. 5.

Again, this indicates a more dramaticimmune response against infection by the \ufffdail mutant, result-ing in immune cell infiltration in the spleen.DISCUSSIONBy coupling random mutagenesis with a phenotypic enrich-ment strategy, we determined that the Ail adhesin is critical forY. pestis to deliver Yop proteins to host cells. The defect in Yopdelivery to the phagocytic cell line, THP-1, is dramatic, yet lessprolonged than the defect in Yop delivery to nonphagocyticHEp-2 cells (Fig. 4).While the YopE-ELK phosphorylation assay indicates verylittle Yop delivery to HEp-2 cells by the KIM5 \ufffdail mutanteven after 8 hours of infection (Fig. 4), the Yop-mediatedcell-rounding assay shows that some Yop delivery is occurringas early as 4 hours after infection with the \ufffdail mutant and thatquite a bit of Yop delivery is occurring by 8 hours postinfection(Fig. 5). Several explanations may address this discrepancy.The YopE129-ELK fusion protein may be translocated lessefficiently than wild-type Yops. The fact that several Yops canmediate cell rounding by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (16)may allow more rapid cell rounding than detection of a singletranslocated molecule. The phosphorylated YopE-ELK mole-cule may also be harder to detect than the activity of multipleYops. In the former case, one must have sufficient transloca-tion and phosphorylation to detect the protein by Westernblotting. In the latter case, one detects the enzymatic activity ofthe Yops. Thus, for cytotoxicity, less Yop delivery may berequired to give a positive signal. Whatever the reason for thedifference in detection, it is clear that the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant isdelayed for Yop delivery and is severely attenuated for viru-lence (Table 2). It remains possible that the measurement ofYopE-ELK phosphorylation is not a direct indicator of Yopdelivery and that the \ufffdail mutation may affect phosphorylationof YopE-ELK after translocation rather than translocationitself. Given the role of Ail as a cellular adhesin and the factthat MAP kinase pathways (the kinase that phosphorylatesElk-1) are known to be operating in cells affected by Yops (45),we prefer the explanation that Ail mediates efficient docking tothe host cell membrane and Yop delivery.Ail of pathogenic Yersinia sp. strains has been shown tomediate adhesion, invasion, autoaggregation, and serum resis-tance (3, 8, 28, 40, 50, 67). Although ail mutants are notFIG. 6. The \ufffdail mutant has reduced levels of tissue colonizationcompared to the wild-type strain, KIM5. Twenty Swiss Webster micewere inoculated with \ufffd100 bacteria i.v. and euthanized at days 1, 2, 3,and 7 (if they survived). Spleen, liver, and lung tissues were removed,weighed, and homogenized. The horizontal line at about 150 CFU/gram of tissue indicates the limit of detection in this assay. The medianlevel of colonization for each strain in each tissue is indicated with ahorizontal bar.

IMMUN.sensitive to mouse serum (3, 65), it remains to be determinedwhich of the other activities of Ail are critical for pathogenesisin mice. Our data indicate that one critical activity of Ail is tofacilitate efficient Yop delivery to targeted host cells duringinfection. We propose that loss of Ail results in a defect in Yopdelivery and in dramatically reduced virulence in vivo.We note that the \ufffdail mutant is not as defective for virulence(103- to 104-fold increase in LD50) as a Y. pestis strain lackingthe pCD1 Yop-containing virulence plasmid (\ufffd107-fold in-crease in LD50) (Felek and Krukonis, unpublished). We arecurrently investigating whether other Y. pestis surface mole-cules may play a role specifically in delivering Yops to phago-cytic cells. Such a surface component may provide a residuallevel of Yop delivery in the absence of Ail.In a recent study, Bartra et al. characterized an indepen-dently generated KIM5 \ufffdail mutant. In their studies, usingretro-orbital inoculation, they found no defect in virulence inSwiss Webster mice for the \ufffdail mutant (3). We recently ob-tained this strain and tested it in our tail-vein injection SwissWebster mouse model and found it to be attenuated (\ufffd3,000-fold increase in LD50) similarly to our KIM5 \ufffdail mutant (datanot shown). It is unclear whether the alternative route of retro-orbital inoculation did not reveal the attenuating effect of the\ufffdail mutation or whether the differences in our results are dueFIG. 7. Histopathology upon Y. pestis infection in the spleen and liver. Swiss Webster mice were inoculated with \ufffd100 bacteria i.v. andeuthanized at day 3. Spleen and liver tissues were fixed in formalin and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Sections from three infected mice in eachgroup were prepared (three panels per bacterial strain [e.g., KIM5 spleen infection in panels A to C]). Images were taken at a magnification of\ufffd400. Some areas of pathology are indicated in boxed areas. Those boxed areas are enlarged in the bottom row of panels. Recovered CFU/gramin the same mouse tissue are provided within the white boxes.FIG. 8. Spleen weights of Y. pestis-infected animals. Twenty SwissWebster mice were inoculated with \ufffd100 bacteria i.v. and euthanizedat day 1, 2, 3, or 7. Spleens were removed and weighed. Increasedspleen weight is an indication of increased immune infiltration in miceinfected with the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant. Decreased spleen weight is anindication of cell death within the spleen in a KIM5 infection. Statis-tical comparisons are between spleen weights on day 1 versus those onday 3 for KIM5 or for the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant. *, P \ufffd 5 \ufffd 105 by theStudent t test.VOL. 77, 2009 Ail PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR Yop DELIVERY 833to the way the bacteria were grown prior to inoculation. Underconditions of overnight growth at 28\u00b0C in HIB prior to tail-veininoculation, both our KIM5 \ufffdail strain and the KIM5 \ufffdailstrain of Bartra et al. were strongly attenuated. If Barta et al.grew their strains in a way to induce other adhesins that areredundant to Ail, they may not have observed the virulencedefects of the ail mutant. We do find that although the calcu-lated LD50 of the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant is \ufffd3,000-fold higher thanthat of KIM5, at low-dose inoculations of 100 organisms, the\ufffdail mutant can sometimes kill a few mice, even when the LD50is calculated to be 28,000 organisms. We take this to mean thatduring infection, other adhesins can be induced in vivo. Ifthose adhesins are induced early enough, we hypothesizethat the attenuating defect of the \ufffdail mutation is compen-sated for by the newly expressed adhesin.Studies on the Y. pseudotuberculosis Ail protein suggestedthat it had no adhesive or invasive activity (67). Given thatthere are only two amino acid substitutions between Y. pseudo-tuberculosis and Y. pestis Ail proteins, we did not anticipateidentifying Ail as a Y. pestis adhesin. In addition, it had beenreported previously that Y. pestis ail in some strains is inacti-vated by an insertion element (61). Thus, we were surprised toidentify Ail as the predominant adhesin in our transposonscreen. Y. pestis Ail has also recently been shown to act as anadhesin by another group (28). We are currently investigatingthe nature of the different activities of Y. pseudotuberculosis Ailand Y. pestis Ail. The two amino acid differences in Ail from Y.pestis and Ail from Y. pseudotuberculosis are predicted to residewithin surface-exposed loops 1 and 3 (3).Another adhesin of Y. pestis is plasminogen activator Pla. Plahas been shown to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix(30, 34) and to cells (27) and also to mediate cellular invasion(17, 29). Much of the adhesion of KIM5 to HEp-2 cells is to thecell periphery or even the extracellular matrix surrounding thecells, especially in a KIM5 \ufffdail mutant (Fig. 3). This suggeststhat Pla may also function as an adhesin in KIM5. We find thata KIM5 \ufffdail \ufffdpla mutant shows a drastic (85%) reduction inbinding to HEp-2 cells and a similar decrease in cellular inva-sion (95% reduction) (S. Felek, unpublished results). We hy-pothesize that Pla was not identified in our transposon screenbecause it is encoded on the pPCP1 plasmid. Thus, there aremultiple copies per cell. Our identification of Ail as an adhesinof Y. pestis is in agreement with the recent findings of Kolodz-iejek et al. (28), although the adhesion defects in our KIM5\ufffdail mutant are less dramatic than the defect they observedwith their KIM6\ufffd \ufffdail mutant. Kolodziejek et al. also found adramatic decrease in invasion with their KIM6\ufffd \ufffdail mutant.We feel that they may have observed such strong adhesion andinvasion phenotypes because their KIM6\ufffd strain lacks Pla. Infact, their strain list indicates that their KIM6\ufffd strain lacks thepPCP1 plasmid.Given the loss of virulence of the \ufffdail mutant (Table 2), Ailmay contribute to multiple steps of pathogenesis\u2014as an adhe-sin during colonization, to deliver Yops to macrophages andneutrophils (the first line of defense against Y. pestis) and toexacerbate Yop-mediated tissue damage and necrosis ofnonphagocytic cells (as represented by cytotoxicity on HEp-2cells) (Fig. 3 and 5).Histological and colonization studies indicate that infectionby the KIM5 \ufffdail mutant leads to greater immune cell infil-tration and eventual clearance of the infection (Fig. 6 and 7).Previous studies with specific yop mutant strains of KIM5 alsodemonstrated clearance of the yop mutants following initialcolonization, as well as distinct histopathology (58). In thespleen, a robust immune response against the ail mutant is alsoindicated by splenomegaly (increased spleen weight) (Fig. 8).It has been shown in a number of studies in vitro that YopJplays a role in suppressing the immune response of host cells toYersinia infections and can direct infected macrophages toundergo apoptosis (41, 45, 47). Not only do we see increasedspleen weight in mice infected by a KIM5 \ufffdail mutant, but also,spleens from the KIM5 (ail\ufffd) strain-infected mice undergo adecrease in spleen weight, perhaps due to apoptosis of spleno-cytes (Fig. 8). Thus, we feel that the inability of the \ufffdail mutantto efficiently deliver Yops may lead to a more robust immuneresponse to the infection. This is in contrast to some recentfindings in the related pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis. In arecent study, it was shown that yopE and yopH mutants of Y.pseudotuberculosis induce a less dramatic immune responsethan wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis during an intragastric in-fection (36). In fact, the yop mutants were more readily clearedwhen coinoculated with the wild-type strain, due to increasedimmune stimulation by the wild-type strain (36). This clearingeffect on yop mutants could even be mediated by inoculatingthe host with wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis strains intraperi-toneally (i.p.) while challenging the mice with the yop mutantsintragastrically (36). While these results suggest that wild-typeY. pseudotuberculosis strains can induce inflammation wheninjected i.p., we would point out that we use a different speciesof Yersinia, Y. pestis, and a different route of inoculation (i.v.).Furthermore the lack of inflammation by yop mutants seen inthe study by Logsdon and Mecsas occurs at the site of theintestine (36). If the yopE and yopH mutants were delivered todeeper tissues, they would likely be rapidly cleared, as has beendemonstrated previously for other yop mutants (58). i.p. inoc-ulation of mice with a yopE or yopH mutant might also havestimulated inflammation which would lead to the clearing ofyopE and yopH mutants colonizing the intestine. Previous stud-ies have revealed a delayed progression of yopE or yopH mu-tant infections to deeper tissues following intragastric inocula-tion (35). Thus, we feel that our study and the study byLogsdon and Mecsas have some distinctions that result indifferential effects on inflammation and clearance of yop mu-tants (or in our case, an ail mutant unable to deliver Yops). Itshould also be noted that a recent study on the progression ofY. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis infections after intradermalinjection indicated that by day 2, there were distinct differencesin the way these two pathogens interact with the innate im-mune system, with Y. pseudotuberculosis stimulating a muchmore organized polymorphonuclear leukocyte response (24).Differences in the way specific Yersinia species are dealt with bythe immune system may reflect distinctions in lipopolysaccha-ride-mediated immune stimulation (42, 51).When Y. pestis is grown at 28\u00b0C, Ail is the predominantadhesin for Yop delivery (Fig. 3 to 5). In Y. pseudotuberculosis,it has been demonstrated that the nature of the adhesin andthe specific signaling cascade that it triggers in host cells arecritical in determining the efficiency of Yop delivery (38). It hasbeen proposed that integrin-mediated signaling in host cellsfollowing Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin-integrin interaction re-834 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT. IMMUN.sults in a series of events leading to efficient YopB/YopD poreformation in host cells and subsequent T3SS-mediated Yopdelivery (1, 2, 38, 62, 66). We hypothesize that since Y. pestislacks invasin, Ail may mediate a receptor interaction that ini-tiates a similar series of events leading to pore formation andYop delivery. Further characterization of the role of Ail in Y.pestis Yop delivery may lead to the identification of steps inplague pathogenesis that are vulnerable to pharmaceutical in-tervention.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by grants to E.S.K. from the University ofMichigan Biomedical Research Council (BMRC), the University ofMichigan Rackham Graduate School, and the University of MichiganOffice of the Vice President for Research.Susan Murray at the University of Michigan School of PublicHealth, Department of Biostatistics, assisted with statistical analysis oftissue colonization.
