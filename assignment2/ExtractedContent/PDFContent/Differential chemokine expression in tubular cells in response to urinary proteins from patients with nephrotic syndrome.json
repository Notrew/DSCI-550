This study aimed to investigate the chemokine expression in human tubular cells inresponse to urine proteins from patients with nephrotic syndrome. Methods: Urine proteins collected from patients with MCD or FSGSwere extracted by ultrafiltration and coincubated with HK-2 cells. The expression of the RANTES and MIF genes and the activation ofp38 and extracellular regulated kinase were determined. Results: The urine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients contained aprimary band of proteins with Mr of \ufffd62 kDa. The major cytokines present in urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients wereIL-6 and IL-8, while IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a were only detectable. We observed time- and dose-dependent increases in RAN-TES and MIF expression with urine protein treatment in HK-2 cells. The urine proteins from FSGS patients induced a higher expressionof these two chemokines in HK-2 cells compared to the urine proteins from MCD patients. ERK and p38 were activated by urine pro-teins from either MCD or FSGS patients. Pretreatment with SB203580 or PD98059 abolished the increase in RANTES and MIF expres-sion induced by urine proteins from FSGS patients, while only SB203580 suppressed the high expression induced by urine proteins fromMCD patients. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients induce a differential expressionof RANTES and MIF in tubular cells through distinct activation of MAPK-related signaling pathways.\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionProgressive nephropathies are characterized by a highlyenhanced glomerular permeability to proteins, in turn lead-ing to proteinuria and concomitant tubulointerstitial dam-age [1\u20133]. How proteinuria results in such precipitatinginterstitial changes is not fully understood, but it is cer-tainly multifactorial and involves numerous pathways ofcellular damage [2\u20134]. Earlier studies in vitro have alreadyconfirmed that certain serum protein components (e.g.albumin and transferrin) can stimulate proximal tubular1043-4666/$ - see front matter \ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, it is well estab-lished that activation of the extracellular signal regulatedkinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) signal transduction pathway plays an importantrole in the inflammatory response [8]. p38 and ERK asimportant signaling molecular have been proved to medi-ate release of MIF and RANTES in tubular cells exposedto a single component such as albumin or IgG, suggestingmailto:yuxq@mail.sysu.edu.cnTable 1Clinical data of patientsPatient characteristic MCD FSGSNumber 10 12Sex (male/female) 9/1 9/3Mean age (years) 21 \u00b1 10 35 \u00b1 17Proteinuria (g/day) 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 3.7 \u00b1 2.0Serum creatinine (lmol/L) 73.0 \u00b1 8.8 92.0 \u00b1 86.7Abbreviations: FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MCD, minimalchange disease.Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233 223a possible link between proteinuria and inflammatory dam-age of tubular cells involving MAPK pathway [9,10]. How-ever, these studies have a significant limitation. They havegenerally used a single serum component (e.g. albumin) atvery high and physiologically irrelevant concentrations tostudy the effect of protein overload on proximal tubularepithelial cells (PTECs) [11,12]. However, the glomerularultrafiltrate often contains a mixture of proteins and a sin-gle component might not be responsible for the damage oftubular cells in renal disease development [13].Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of themost prevalent histopathological lesions in idiopathicnephrotic syndrome. It is distinguished clinically from min-imal change disease (MCD) by non-selective proteinuria,steroid resistance and progressive renal insufficiency. Fur-thermore, it has been shown that FSGS patients presentedmore often with progressive tubular degeneration andinterstitial fibrosis compared to MCD patients even thoughboth diseases had a similar degree of proteinuria [14\u201317].Thus in an effort to find therapeutic targets in proteinuria,comparison of urine proteins in MCD and FSGS patientshas been previously conducted [18\u201320], but the relationshipbetween the severity of tubular injury and the compositionof urine proteins in various kidney diseases is unknown.To seek further evidence, we have hypothesized that theuse of a wide range of proteins extracted from proteinuriamight closely resemble the glomerular ultrafiltrate in tubu-lar lumen and serve as a model for further study in themechanism of tubular damage induced by proteinuria inkidney diseases. This study was undertaken to assess andcompare the expression of two important chemokines,RANTES and MIF, in cultured proximal tubular cellstreated with urine proteins extracted from MCD or FSGSpatients and to explore the possible role of ERK and p38-MAPK signaling transduction pathways in differential che-mokine production.2. Materials and methods2.1. Reagents and drugsHK-2 cells, a primary human proximal tubular cell line,was purchased from American Type Culture Collection(Manassas, VA); Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium(DMEM)/F-12, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and trypsin/ethy-lenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution were pur-chased from Gibco (Langley, OK); TRIzol and reversetranscriptase were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); PCRbuffer, Taq polymerase and dNTPs were from Takara BioInc. (Shiga, Japan), and ELISA Quantikine kit for RANTESwas from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The specificinhibitors, SB203580 and PD98059, were from CalBiochem(San Diego, CA). Primary antibodies of p38 and ERK werefrom Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Purifiedhuman serum albumin (HSA, A5843), Triton X-100, anddimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St.Louis, MO). Polymyxin B-immobilized columns (Detoxi-GelTM) were from Pierce Chemical (Rockford, IL). Theultrafilter (Labscale TTF system, PXC 100C 50) was pur-chased from Millipore Co. (Billerica, MA). The humaninflammation Cytometric Bead Array kit for determininginterleukins (IL-8, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70), andtumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and BD LSR II flowcytometer were from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA).2.2. Patients and urine collectionInformed consent was obtained from all patients partici-pating in this study, after local Ethics Committee approval.Diagnosis was established based on the criteria of ICD-11for 10 patients with MCD and 12 patients with FSGSthrough biopsy using light and electron microscopy. Onlypatients who have never been treated with steroid or anyother immunosuppressive agents were enrolled in this study.The spontaneous urine was collected in a clean container onice (\ufffd4 \ufffdC) and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until analysis. Some keyclinical data of the patients studied are summarized in Table 1.The mean urine protein concentration in MCD and FSGSpatients was 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 mg/ml and 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 mg/ml, respec-tively. Thus, a concentration range of 0.1\u201310 mg/ml forthe urine proteins was used for our in vitro experiments.2.3. Urine protein ultrafiltration and preparationFollowing initial centrifugation (4000g for 15 min at4 \ufffdC) the supernatant of urine sample was collected and fil-tered by a 0.45-lm filtration membrane to remove non-sol-uble deposits and cellular particles. The samples were thenapplied to an ultrafilter with polyethersulfone membrane(5 kDa molecule weight cut-off and low protein bindingmembrane). After lyophilization using a freeze dryer toremove extra water, the urine protein extract was storedat \ufffd80 \ufffdC. In all in vitro experiment, dried and powderedurine proteins were dissolved in sterile phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) and then added to cells. Endotoxin in urineproteins was removed by polymyxin B-immobilized col-umns and cleared reagents contained <0.1 EU/ml of endo-toxin as determined by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.Urine proteins were eluted in 0.5 mM NaCl and 50 mMTris at pH 7.5. Coomassie-stained sodium dodecylsulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE)was used to verify that there was no gross degradation ofthe proteins prepared using this protocol.224 Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u20132332.4. Quantification of cytokines using cytometric bead array(CBA)Six cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 andTNF-a) in patient urine proteins were quantified simulta-neously using a human inflammation CBA kit according tothe manufacture\u2019s instructions (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,CA). The BD LSR II flow cytometer was calibrated withsetup beads and 3000 events were acquired for each sample.Six standard curves (standard ranging from 0 to 5000 pg/ml)were obtained from one set of calibrators and data on the sixcytokines were simultaneously obtained for each test sample.Individual cytokine concentration ratios were indicated bytheir fluorescent intensities. The urine proteins from eachpatient were dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of60 mg/ml and assayed. The limits of detection for IL-1b,IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a were 7.2, 2.5, 3.6,3.3, 1.9 and 3.7 pg/ml, respectively.2.5. Cell cultureHK-2 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 plus 10%FCS. The cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5%CO2 and 95% air at 37 \ufffdC and given fresh medium every3\u20135 days. Experiments were performed on cells within 10passages. Viable cells were counted using the trypan blueexclusion method.2.6. MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakageassayThe effect of urine proteins on HK-2 cell proliferationwas measured using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphe-nyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). In brief, cells were grownin 96-well culture plates and treated by urine proteins fromMCD or FSGS patients or HSA for 72 h. The culture vol-ume was 100 ll. Ninety minutes before the end of theappropriate treatment periods, 10 ll of MTT (5 mg/ml inPBS) was added to each culture well. After incubationfor a further 4 h at 37 \ufffdC, the culture medium was removedand the purple crystals formed were dissolved in 150 ll of0.1 M HCl in isopropanol. The absorbance was measuredusing a microplate reader at 570 nm with a backgroundcorrection at 690 nm.The LDH leakage assay was used to assess cytosolicmembrane integrity. HK-2 cells were seeded in 24-wellplates at a cell density of 3 \ufffd 105 cells in 1000 ll/well andtreated by urine proteins for 72 h. Thereafter, 600 ll incu-bation medium was collected from the culture wells andintracellular LDH was harvested by solubilizing cells with600 ll 0.1% Triton X-100. Enzyme leakage was determinedin the incubation medium and compared with total LDHactivity (extracellular plus intracellular LDH) detected withan automatic biochemical autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7170A,Tokyo, Japan). The experiments were performed at leastthree times, using 4 wells for each test compound at differ-ent concentrations.2.7. Treatment of HK-2 cells with ultrafiltered urine proteinsCells were preincubated with serum-free DMEM/F-12for 24 h. HK-2 cells were exposed to 5 mg/ml HSA, orurine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at concentra-tions of 0.1\u201310 mg/ml over 48 h to detect RANTES andMIF expression. p38 or ERK protein expression were eval-uated by Western blot analysis in cell lysates from HK-2cells treated with HSA or urine proteins at 1 mg/ml for20 min. To evaluate the effect of ERK and p38 inhibitoron chemokine expression, cells were pretreated with10 mM SB203580 and 50 mM PD98059 for 1 h beforeand during incubation with urine proteins. Both inhibitorswere prepared in DMSO with a final concentration of 0.1%(v/v) of the solvent in the test sample.2.8. Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)Total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent. ExtractedRNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm using a spec-trometer. Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse tran-scribed to cDNA in a 20 ll reaction mixture containing50 ng random primer, 0.5 mmol/L dNTPs and 20 U ofRNase inhibitor. Specific primer sequences were as fol-lowed: GAPDH, sense 50-AGT CCA CTG GCG TCTTCA C-30, antisense 50-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGA G-30, 639 bp; RANTES/CCL5, sense 50-GTTTACGGGAAATCT TCGCACC-30, antisense 50-GTCGGAGCGGCTGTAGTC-30, 300 bp; and MIF, sense 50-CCTGGTCCTTCT GCCATCAT-30, antisense 50-CTTGCTGTAGGAGCGGTTCT-30, 252 bp. PCR products wereanalyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained withethidium bromide. Images of the gel were captured usingthe Gel Doc 1000 gel Documentation System from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Gene expression was then analyzedby the IP Lab gel software from Signal Analytics (Vienna,VA). Data were expressed as the ratio of specificMIF or RANTES/CCL5 mRNA normalized to GAPDHmRNA.2.9. SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblottingTo demonstrate activation of p38 and ERK, Westernblot analysis of protein extracts from HK-2 cells treatedwith HSA or urine proteins was performed. Twenty micro-grams of protein were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE, using a10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulosemembranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \ufffdCwith PBS containing 5% BSA. The blots were incubatedfor 1 h with the following primary antibodies: rabbit poly-clonal antibody p-p38 and p38; mouse monoclonal anti-body p-ERK; or rabbit polyclonal antibody ERK. Afterincubation with the secondary antibodies (horseradish per-oxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or rabbit anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h, protein bands were detected bySuper-Signal chemiluminescent substrate.MCD FSGS506070851001201502002501       2        3       4    Marker   5        6       7       8       9      10     11    HSA50607085100120150200250        Fig. 1.

Determination of RANTES levels by ELISAThe culture media of proximal tubular cells on a 24-wellplate were collected and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until assay. Con-centrations of RANTES in the culture supernatants ofHK-2 cells were measured by commercial ELISA kitsaccording to the manufacture\u2019s instructions. All sampleswere assayed in triplicate and the data were presented asmeans \u00b1 SD. The optical density (OD) was measured at450 nm and RANTES concentrations were extrapolatedfrom a standard curve using recombinant human RAN-TES. RANTES measurement was also performed on thesolutions used to stimulate the cells to exclude the effectsof contaminant RANTES in urine protein extracts.2.11. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal laser scanningmicroscopyHuman HK-2 cell cultures were fixed in ice acetone for10 min, washed and blocked with 5% BSA. Cells were incu-bated overnight with anti-MIF or anti-RANTES antibodyand were then incubated for 45 min with FITC-labeleddonkey anti-goat or mouse secondary antibody. Primaryantibody was replaced with isotype IgG as a negative con-trol. The cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI).2.12. Quantification of cellular MIF and RANTESexpression by flow cytometryRANTES and MIF expression on HK-2 cells was eval-uated by flow cytometric analysis. Following treatment asdescribed above, cells were collected and incubated witheither FITC-labeled mouse anti-human RANETS andMIF monoclonal antibody or an appropriate isotype-matched antibody for 45 min at 4 \ufffdC and then were ana-lyzed by FACS (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FA) with Win-MDI software (TSRI Cytometry, San Diego, CA). Themean specific fluorescence intensity was measured in eachchannel (10,000 cells/sample). Mean values from threemeasurements and standard deviations were determined.2.13. Statistical analysisData are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation.Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed bypost hoc least significant difference test. Analyses were per-formed using SPSS software 12.0. A P-value of less than0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.3. Result3.1. Analysis patterns of ultrafiltered urinary proteins fromMCD and FSGS patients in gel electrophoresisThe composition of ultrafiltered urine proteins was ana-lyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results are shown inFig. 1. All proteins with Mr of < 5 kDa were removed byultrafiltration. Human HSA shows one primary band only,with a molecular weight of approximately 66 kDa. The gelrevealed two similar protein band patterns but with somedifferences in the protein band range analyzed. The urineproteins from both MCD and FSGS patients contained aprimary band of proteins with Mr of approximately62 kDa, followed by bands with Mr of approximately 83,130 and 200 kDa. Both urine protein samples also con-tained some protein bands with Mr < 50 kDa. However,the urine proteins from FSGS patients contained severalremarkable bands with Mr > 250 kDa, but they were notremarkable for urine samples from MCD patients.3.2. Detection of cytokines in urine proteins from MCD orFSGS patientsExperiments were performed to evaluate six cytokinelevels by CBA in the urine proteins of MCD and FSGSpatients. There was a large variability in the levels of sixcytokines in urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients(Fig. 2). For both MCD and FSGS patients, the majorcytokines present in urine proteins were IL-6 and IL-8. InMCD patients, there was a 15-fold variability in the uri-nary levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The variability was 14- and39-folds in FSGS patients. The mean levels of urinaryIL-6 in MCD and FSGS patients were 76.1 \u00b1 85.9 and73.0 \u00b1 71.2 pg/ml, respectively. The mean value for IL-8in MCD and FSGS patients was 92.4 \u00b1 92.5 and134.4 \u00b1 213.8 pg/ml, respectively. In most MCD andFSGS patients, IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a wereonly detectable by our CBA-based assays (Fig. 2). No sig-nificant difference existed between the urinary levels of allcytokines tested in FSGS and MCD patients.IL-1\u03b2 IL-6 IL-8 IL-10 IL-12p7 TNF-\u03b10100200300400Cytokine level (pg/ml)Fig. 2.

Effect of urine proteins from MCD and FSGS on cellularproliferation (A) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage (B) in HK-2cells. For MTT assay, HK-2 cells were treated with 5 or 10 mg/ml urineproteins and incubated for 72 h. For LDH leakage assay, HK-2 cells weretreated with 1, 5 or 10 mg/ml urine proteins and incubated for 72 h. TheLDH activity was determined using an automatic biochemical autoana-lyzer. Data are means \u00b1 SD of four independent determinations.226 Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u20132333.3. Cytotoxicity of urine proteins from MCD or FSGSpatients in HK-2 cellsThe urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at con-centrations 65.0 mg/ml did not elicit significant cytotoxic-ity after incubation with HK-2 cells for 72 h (data notshown). When the urine protein concentrations increasedto 10 mg/ml, a marked cytotoxicity was observed. Theurine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at 10 mg/mlcaused a 52.3% and 56.6% (P < 0.05) reduction of cell sur-vival in HK-2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3). HSA at 5 and10 mg/ml only slightly reduced the cell proliferation inHK-2 cells.We further examined the effects of urine proteins fromMCD and FSGS patients on the lactate dehydrogenaseleakage in HK-2 cells. After 72 h incubation, the urine pro-teins from MCD patients at 1, 5 and 10 mg/ml induced a12.3%, 94.7% and 247.3% increase in LDH leakage, respec-tively, compared to the control (Fig. 3). The LCD leakagein HK-2 cells cotreated with urine proteins from FSGSpatients at 1, 5 and 10 mg/ml for 72 h was increased by76.8%, 137.85% and 249.1%, respectively, compared tothe control. The urine proteins from FSGS patientsinduced a greater leakage of LDH than those from MCDpatients.3.4. Effects of ultrafiltered urine proteins from MCD orFSGS patients on RANTES and MIF expression in HK-2cellsWe first examined the effect of urine protein treatmenton the RANTES and MIF mRNA expression in HK-2 cellswhen incubated over 48 h. With exposure of the HK-2 cellsto ultrafiltered urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patientsat 5.0 mg/ml over 48 h, the increase of both RANTES andMIF mRNA levels was time-dependent, with increasinginduction of both genes when the incubation time increasedover 48 h (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of HK-2cells with 5.0 mg/ml urine proteins from MCD patients for3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h significantly increased the expressionof RANTES and MIF 5.3-, 6.8-, 14.1-, 17.9- and 23.8-fold;and 1.7-, 2.0-, 2.0-, 2.8- and 3.5-fold, respectively, com-pared to the control (zero time incubation) (P < 0.05,Fig. 4). When the cells were treated with ultrafiltered urineproteins from FSGS patients for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, theexpression of RANTES mRNA was significantly increased8.3-, 14.4-, 17.5-, 22.5- and 24.1-fold, and the MIF mRNAlevels were also significantly increased 2.0-, 3.2-, 4.1-, 4.3-and 4.4-fold, respectively, compared to the control (zerotime incubation) (P < 0.05, Fig. 4). The urine proteins fromFSGS patients induced a greater magnitude of both RAN-TES and MIF mRNA expression compared to those fromMCD patients after 6 h incubation up to 48 h (P < 0.05).With exposure of the HK-2 cells to ultrafiltered urineproteins from MCD or FSGS patients at concentrationsin the range of 0.1\u201310.0 mg/ml for 24 h, the increase ofRANTES and MIF mRNA levels was dose-dependent,with a maximal induction at 5\u201310 mg/ml (Fig. 5). Theinduction of RANTES and MIF by urine proteins fromMCD and FSGS patients appeared saturable, when theconcentrations of urine proteins were greater than 0.1and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively.

Effects of SB203580 and PD98059 on RANTES andMIF mRNA expressionBecause some controversy exists regarding the specificform of MAPK that is necessary and sufficient for produc-tion of chemoattractants in response to damage caused byurine proteins, we evaluated the effects of two specificMAPK inhibitors, PD98059 and SB20358, on urine proteinmediated chemotaxis of human PTECs. PD98059 at50 mM, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway, almostcompletely inhibited urine protein-mediated activation ofERK1/2. Pretreatment of PD98059 at 50 mM led to signif-icant reduction of RANTES and MIF mRNA expression incells exposed to urine proteins from FSGS patients(Fig. 10). However, it had no significant inhibitory effecton elevated RANTES and MIF expression by urine pro-teins from MCD patients.Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233 231On the other hand, SB20358 at 10 mM, a specific inhib-itor of p38 pathway, almost abolished the activation of p38mediated by urine proteins in our preliminary experiment.Increase of RANTES and MIF mRNA expression inducedby urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients was signif-icantly suppressed by pretreatment with SB20358 at10 mM. Incubating HK-2 cells with the control vehiclealone (0.1% DMSO, v/v) resulted in no significant inhibi-tion of both ERK1/2 and p38 expression.4. DiscussionIn our study, we extracted the urine protein mixtureusing ultrafiltration techniques and treated PTECs withsuch extract to imitate the overall damage of proximaltubule in renal disease in vivo. Ultrafiltration techniqueshave a number of advantages over other chemical purifica-tion techniques, being a less time-consuming process andexcluding any chemical and heating processing to maintainactivity and integrity of proteins to a maximum extent. Theurine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients werecarefully processed during lyophilization and ultrafiltrationto retain the activity of protein molecules and to avoid con-tamination and addition of external substances. The resul-tant ultrafiltrates are totally different from those fromplasma in terms of the presence of cytokines and otherpotentially toxic molecules that are secreted by tubularcells.Electrophoretic analysis of the urine protein extractsshowed similar band profiles between FSGS and MCDpatients, with a primary band of proteins with Mr ofapproximately 62 kDa (Fig. 1.). However, the urineextracts from FSGS patients contained several markedbands with Mr > 250 kDa, but these bands were not appar-ent for urine samples from MCD patients. It appeared thatFSGS patients excreted more proteins with a large molec-ular weight from their urine compared to MCD patients.Some large molecular proteins such as immunoglobinand complement were well known frequently detected innon-selective proteinuria. The urine protein extracts appearlargely mimic the composition of glomerular ultrafiltratesin tubular lumen in nephrotic syndrome and thus providea useful in vitro model for mechanistic study of tubulardamage induced by proteinuria.To examine the concentrations of six proinflammatorycytokines in urine proteins, the CBA technique wasapplied. Our study showed that there was a large variabilityin the levels of six cytokines in urine proteins from MCD orFSGS patients (Fig. 2). The major cytokines present inurine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients wereIL-6 and IL-8, while IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-awere only detectable. The urinary cytokines at low concen-trations in MCD and FSGS patients may act as a lessimportant foster to activate tubular cells in proteinuria.Recent evidence suggested that urinary cytokines may besecreted by activated and proliferative glomerular cellsand correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes [21,22].High urinary levels of cytokines have been more frequentlydemonstrated in the patients with proliferative glomerulo-nephritis, but not in the patients with non-proliferative glo-merulonephritis such as MCD and FSGS [6]. Urinarycytokines, especially TNF-a and IL-6, can be secreted byactivated and proliferative glomerular cells [21,22].Our studies have demonstrated that the urine proteinsfrom both MCD and FSGS patients at higher concentra-tions (>5 mg/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferationof HK-2 cells (Fig. 3), which was accompanied byincreased leakage of LDH from the cells. Such cytotoxicitywas more apparent when the cells were treated with urineproteins from FSGS patients compared to those fromMCD patients. These results are in agreement with previ-ous studies where exposure to protein overload induces adecrease in proliferation and significant release of LDHof tubular cells in vivo and in vitro and protein fractionscontaining high molecular weight proteins overload aremore cytotoxic [23\u201325]. The mechanism for the cytotoxicityof urine proteins may be related to apoptosis induction andcell necrosis initiated by toxic substances such as TNF-aand other cytokines in the urine.Through tubular cells with exposure to urine proteins,we found that urine protein induced significantly elevationin expression of RANTES/CCL5 and MIF at both mRNAand protein levels (Figs. 4\u20136), which is consistent of previ-ous studies in the stimulation of single component (e.g.albumin or transferrin) overload in vitro [26,27]. Therefore,our study has further confirmed that proteinuria mayinduce tubulointerstitial damage by activating the synthesisof inflammatory mediators and induce intrinsic renaltoxicity.To check on the protein production of RANTES andMIF in HK-2 cells coincubated with urine proteins fromMCD and FSGS patients, the following techniques wereapplied: ELISA, immunofluorescence microscope and flowcytometric analysis. Consistent with increased RANTESand MIF mRNA levels, urine proteins from MCD andFSGS significantly increased the production of RANTESand MIF in HK-2 cells but the latter elicited a greater effectcompared to the urine proteins from MCD (Figs. 7 and 8).The distinct effect was considered due to different composi-tion of proteins in the urine samples from MCD and FSGSpatients. Similar to the lack of effect on RANTES and MIFmRNA expression, HSA treatment did not significantlyalter the production of RANTES and MIF by HK-2 cells.We observed that the proinflammatory potential ofurine proteins from FSGS patients appeared to be greaterthan that of urine proteins from MCD patients becauseof the more significantly elevated levels of RANTES andMIF in PTECs induced by urine proteins from FSGSpatients. The differential effects might be attributed to thedifference in the components of urine proteins from FSGSand MCD patients. Despite of unknown composition asyet, presence of macromolecular proteins in FSGS non-selective proteinuria perhaps serve as one of the majormechanism. High molecular weight proteins such as immu-232 Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233noglobin and complement have already been proved toinduce the higher expression of chemokine and more signif-icant inflammatory activation compared with albumin inrenal tubular cells [28,29]. Such evidence perhaps accountfor the discrepancy over the effect of urine protein betweenFSGS and MCD nephropathy.To investigate the mechanism behind the urine proteininduced inflammatory activation, we examined the role ofERK and p38-MAPK pathways in HK-2 cells. Our studyshowed that treatment of urine proteins from MCD orFSGS patients mediated a significantly activation of p38-MAPK and ERK (Fig. 9). The result has been supportedby previous finding that the stimulation of plasma compo-nent (e.g. albumin or transferrin) overload activatedMAPK pathway in cultured tubular cells [30].To explore the molecular mechanism for the differentialchemokine induced turnover in tubular cells, we proceededto apply two widely used specific inhibitors, PD98059 andSB203580, in our inhibition studies. Our data shown thatthe elevated expression of RANTES and MIF induced byurine proteins from MCD patients was mediated by p38-MAPK pathway but not ERK pathway, while both ERKand p38-MAPK pathways were involved in the increasedMIF and RANTES secretion induced by urine proteinsfrom FSGS patients. The discrepancies of the intracellularsignaling mechanisms may be due to the differential regula-tion of some specific components in urine proteins on che-mokine secretion. Earlier studies had reported that serumIgG, other than albumin or transferrin, could induce andincrease IL-6 secretion via early activated of ERK inPTECs [31].Previous studies have shown that exposure to albumininduced increased expression and secretion of variouschemokines in tubular cells via activated MAPK path-way [31\u201335]. However, in our study, purified albumin(5 mg/ml) alone had no or minor effect on up regulationof RANTES and MIF expression. Moreover, HSA at1 mg/ml failed to effectively activate ERK and p38-MAPK pathways [10]. Discrepancies over the effect ofalbumin in response to protein overload can be attrib-uted to differences in experimental design. The concentra-tion of albumin (>10 mg/ml) that is required to induceinflammatory responses in previous studies exceeded theconcentration of albumin in proximal tubular fluid evenin severe nephrotic syndromes [36\u201338]. Thus, our findingsfurther confirmed that the stimulation of serum albuminshould not be considered as the major factor responsiblefor tubular cell damage in the progression of tubulointer-stitial fibrosis though it is the most abundant componentin proteinuric conditions.Our study has important clinical implications. The dif-ferential production of RANTES and MIF and involve-ment of p38 and ERK pathways in tubular cells inresponse to urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patientssuggest that these cytokines and signaling pathways mayrepresent potential novel therapeutic targets but the thera-peutic outcome might be very different. The differentialchemokine production and p38 and ERK activationin vitro by urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patientsmay be used to predict disease status and progressionin vivo, although further clinical studies are needed.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that urine proteinsfrom FSGS induced the significantly higher expression ofchemokines in tubular epithelial cells compared to urineproteins from MCD patients through distinct MAPK-asso-ciated signaling pathways. Though a comprehensive analy-sis of components in urine proteins should be required inour further study, it has provided initial evidence that thequality of proteinuria plays an important role in eventuallydetermining the severity and progression of tubular inflam-matory injury associated with different kidney diseases.References[1] Remuzzi G, Bertani T.
