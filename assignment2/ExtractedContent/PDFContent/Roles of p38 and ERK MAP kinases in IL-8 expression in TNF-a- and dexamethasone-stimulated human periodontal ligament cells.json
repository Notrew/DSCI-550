However, thecell-signaling pathways linking interleukin-8 (IL-8), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and dexa-methasone in hPDL cells have not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)kinases in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in hPDL cells. IL-8 production was measured byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. MAP kinaseactivation and IjB degradation were determined by Western blot analysis, and ICAM-1 expression was determined by RT-PCR andFACS analysis. TNF-a increased IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dexamethasonesuppressed TNF-a-induced IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-induced phos-phorylation of p38 MAP kinase and extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), IjB degradation, and NF-jB activation. Selective inhibitorsfor ERKs and p38 attenuated TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in the presence and absence of dexamethasone, indicatingthat MAP kinases play a role in the response of hDPL cells to TNF-a. Furthermore, these results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-and dexamethasone-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1, produced via a MAP kinase pathway, may serve as an important mediator of PDLimmunoregulation involved in bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement.\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionDuring orthodontic tooth movement, applied mechani-cal loading induces inflammation in the periodontal liga-ment (PDL). The cells of the PDL respond to thesemechanical signals by synthesizing cytokines and growthfactors, both of which regulate alveolar bone resorptionand formation [1,2].

Kim).space, where they differentiate into mature osteoclasts. Theosteoclasts then resorb alveolar bone upon stimulation byPDL-derived cytokines [3]. The mechanisms by whichinflammatory cytokines mediate osteoclast formation andbone resorption are not completely understood, however,particularly in human PDL (hPDL) cells.The chemotactic cytokine known as interleukin 8 (IL-8)and the cell-surface adhesion molecule known as intercellu-lar adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are major mediators ofinflammation that contribute to sequestration of neutro-phils at sites of tissue injury [4]. IL-8 is a member of theCXC chemokine family of cytokines that were originallyidentified as monocyte-derived factors capable of attractingmailto:eckwkop@wonkwang.ac.kr68 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376and activating neutrophils [5,6]. IL-8 is produced by a vari-ety of cell types, such as macrophages, neutrophils, andendothelial cells, in response to inflammation and injury[7]. IL-8 is increasingly being recognized as a multifunc-tional cytokine with other activities, in addition to its activ-ity as a chemokine.In bone, IL-8 is synthesized by osteoblasts and osteo-clasts [8]. Bendre et al. [9] demonstrated that the actionsof IL-8 related to bone resorption are both indirect anddirect. IL-8 indirectly stimulates expression of osteoblastreceptor activator of NF-jB ligand (RANKL), and itdirectly affects the osteoclastogenic response of humanosteoclast precursors. Recently, Tuncer et al. [10] observedthat orthodontic forces lead to an increase in IL-8 and sub-sequent accumulation of neutrophils, suggesting that IL-8triggers bone remodeling. Thus, IL-8 may be importantin regulation of bone formation and resorption duringorthodontic tooth movement.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a is an inflammatory cyto-kine that appears to be an important mediator of bonedestruction in inflammatory disease [11]. TNF-a is primar-ily produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, andosteoblasts, and it stimulates osteoclast differentiationand osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro and in vivo [12].Various studies have shown that prostaglandin E (PGE),IL-1b, and TNF-a are increased in human gingival crevic-ular fluid during orthodontic tooth movement [13,14]. Fur-thermore, TNF-a has recently been reported to enhanceexpression of IL-8 mRNA and secretion of IL-8 proteinin various cell types [8,15,16]. Therefore, TNF-a is believedto play a key role in the biological processes involved inorthodontic tooth movement.The roles of glucocorticoids in osteoclast formation andactivation have been extensively examined in vivo andin vitro, with conflicting results. These osteotropic factorsare thus assumed to play different roles in different micro-environments and cell types [17,18]. In a study by Pharoahand Heersche [19], dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorti-coid analog, inhibited the formation of osteoclast-like cellsin bone marrow cultures. However, in other studies, gluco-corticoids increased osteoclast formation and activitythrough both direct and indirect mechanisms [17,18,20].Hirayama et al. [21] reported that dexamethasone directlyaffected osteoclast formation and activity, stimulating theproliferation and differentiation of human osteoclast pre-cursors, and inhibiting the bone resorption activity ofmature osteoclasts. In the present study, we investigatedthe effects of dexamethasone in the presence of variousosteotropic factors to gain additional insight regarding itsrole in hDPL cells.The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs)comprise well-conserved signaling pathways and includeextracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-ter-minal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPK. These activatedkinases initiate a cascade of protein phosphorylation thatactivates nuclear transcription factors, such as NF-jB,and AP-1. These transcription factors subsequently pro-mote expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,and ICAMs [22,23].We hypothesized that orthodontic tooth movementcauses inflammation and release of IL-8- and ICAM-1-in-ducing cytokines by activating MAPK signaling pathwaysin hPDL cells. In the present study, we focused on IL-8secretion and ICAM-1 expression because these moleculesare known to play important roles in the recruitment of cir-culating inflammatory cells. We investigated the effects ofTNF-a and dexamethasone on the production of chemo-kines and ICAM-1 via activation of MAPK signaling path-ways in primary cultured hPDL cells.2.

Dexamethasone and allother chemicals were bought from Sigma Chemical Co.(St. Louis, MO, USA) unless indicated otherwise.2.2. Primary culture of hPDL cellshPDL cells were isolated with an explant culture tech-nique from patients, with an age under 25 years undergoingorthodontic treatment by following described methods [24].Informed written consent from donors were obtained foruse of the tissues. Patients signed the correspondinginformed consent approved by the Institutional ReviewBoard at Wonkwang University for used of the tissues.Briefly, these tissues were cut into 1 mm2 explants andplaced on a 100 mm culture dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL,USA) containing 10,000 U/ml of penicillin G sodium,10,000 lg/ml of streptomycin sulphate, 25 lg/ml ofamphotericin B, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovineserum (FBS; Gibco-BRL, Grand island, NY, USA) at37 \ufffdC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%air. After 2 or 3 days, cells started to outgrow from theexplants. When the primary cell culture reached conflu-ence, cells were detached with 0.025% trypsin and 0.05%EDTA, diluted with culture medium, and then subculturedin a ratio of 1:4. Cell cultures between the 5th and 7thH.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 69passage were used in this study. Alkaline phosphataseactivity for 3 days was checked before the experiments.2.3. ELISA for IL-8 protein measurementhPDL cells were seeded at 2 \u00b7 105 into 24-well plates(Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) andgrown until formation of confluent monolayers, reachinga final density of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/well. Monolayers were thenincubated for 4\u201348 h in a fresh medium containing stimulias indicated. The supernatants were collected, cleared bycentrifugation, and kept at \ufffd20 \ufffdC until evaluation byELISA. For measurement of IL-8 concentrations in cellculture supernatants, 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp;Nunc) were coated with 0.2 lg/well goat anti-human IL-8Abs (R&D Systems) in 50 ll of PBS at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Allfurther steps were conducted at room temperature. Afterwashing three times with PBS, nonspecific binding siteswere blocked by incubation with 150 ll PBS + 1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20/well for 2 h. After three washes withPBS, 50 ll of samples or IL-8 standards were added andincubated for 2 h. As a second Ab, 0.05 lg/well polyclonalrabbit anti-human IL-8 (Endogen) was added and incu-bated for 2 h. As a third Ab, alkaline phosphatase-labeledmonoclonal mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) wasdiluted in 50 ll of PBS + 0.1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 to1:50,000 and incubated for 2 h. Finally, alkaline phospha-tase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich)was added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M glycinebuffer (pH 10.4) containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mMZnCl2. After overnight incubation, plates were read at405 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sun-nyvale, CA, USA). The detection limit of the ELISAwas 30 pg/ml.2.4. Cell viability assayViable cells were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye, whichforms blue formazan crystals that are reduced by mito-chondrial dehydrogenase present in living cells. Briefly,2 \u00b7 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and culturedovernight for cell attachment. After cell treatment, 50 llof MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to eachwell and incubated for 4 h. To each well, 50 ll of DMSOwere added. The plates were then shaken until the crystalshad dissolved. Reduced MTT was then measured spectro-photometrically in a dual beam microtiter plate reader at570 nm.2.5. RNA isolation and RT-PCRCells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes and incubatedfor 4\u201324 h in a fresh medium containing stimuli as indicat-ed. After discarding growth medium, total RNA was iso-lated from cells using easy-Blue (iNtRON Biotechnology,Daejon, Korea), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed usingAccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea). Onemicrogram of RNA and 20 pmol/ll primers were preincu-bated at 70 \ufffdC for 5 min and transferred to a mixture tube.The reaction volume was 20 ll. cDNA synthesis was per-formed at 42 \ufffdC for 60 min, followed by RT inactivationat 94 \ufffdC for 5 min. Thereafter, the RT-generated DNA(2\u20135 ll) was amplified using AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bio-neer).

PCR products wereresolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidiumbromide.2.6. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAP kinaseCells were stimulated according to designated experi-mental protocols. Proteins were extracted with an extrac-tion buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, containing150 mM NaCl, 1% nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxy-cholate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovana-date, 1 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin,10 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benze-nesulfonyl fluoride). Activation of MAP kinase was exam-ined by determining its phosphorylation state using theantibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of p38MAP kinase and ERK-1 and ERK-2.2.7. Western blot analysisProtein samples (50 lg) were mixed with an equal vol-ume of 2\u00b7 SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and thenseparated through 8\u201315% SDS\u2013PAGE gels. After electro-phoresis, proteins were transferred to nylon membranesby electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blockedin 5% dry milk (1 h), rinsed, and incubated with primaryantibodies (diluted at 1:500 or 1:1000) in TBS overnightat 4 \ufffdC. Primary antibody was then removed by washing70 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376the membranes four times in TBS, and labeled by incubat-ing with 0.1 mg/ml peroxidase-labeled secondary antibod-ies (against mouse and rabbit) for 1 h. Following threewashes in TBS, bands were visualized by ECL and exposedto X-ray film.2.8. Surface ICAM-1 expression by flow cytometryMonolayers of PDL cells were detached by incubationwith trypsin 0.25% and EDTA 0.25% in calcium- and mag-nesium-free PBS (pH 7.2). For single-label flow cytometricanalysis of ICAM-1 expression, 2 \u00b7 105 cells/ml were incu-bated for 30 min on ice with 2.5 ll of anti-human ICAM-1MAb in a total volume of 500 ll of PBS containing0.05 mM EDTA, BSA 0.1% and FBS 0.05%. After washingtwice, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 500 ll ofa dilution (1 in 100) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (DAKO). Cells werewashed twice with PBS then the immunofluorescence ofthe FITC single label was measured with a flow cytometer(Beckton\u2013Dickinson, CS, USA).2.9. Statistical analysisThe results were expressed as means \u00b1 SD of three inde-pendent experiments. Statistical significances were com-pared between each treated group and control by theStudent\u2019s t-test. Each experiment was repeated at leastthree times and yielded comparable results. Values withp < 0.05 were considered significant.Fig. 1. Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein in hPDL cellthe time indicated (A and B).

Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA andprotein in hPDL cellsWe first determined the time course for IL-8 secretion inhPDL cells in response to TNF-a, as well as the optimalTNF-a concentration for this response. Cells were treatedwith TNF-a, the cell culture media were harvested, andthe level of secreted IL-8 protein was determined byELISA. TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretion was found tosteadily increase in a time- and dose-dependent manner(Fig. 1A and C). Maximal induction was seen after 48 hof exposure to 20 ng/ml TNF-a. When the level of IL-8mRNA in the induced cultures was analyzed by RT-PCR, the increase in IL-8 protein secretion correlated withthe accumulation of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 1B and D).3.2. Effects of dexamethasone on TNF-a-induced expressionof IL-8 mRNA, IL-8 protein and cell viability in hPDL cellsWe next investigated the effect of dexamethasone onTNF-a-induced production of IL-8 and cell viability inhPDL cells. Treatment of cell cultures with dexamethasone(10\ufffd9, 10\ufffd8, and 10\ufffd7 M) significantly inhibited the induc-tion of IL-8 mRNA expression, protein secretion and cellviability by TNF-a (10 ng/ml), in a concentration-depen-dent manner (Fig. 2A\u2013C). In particular, treatment with10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone dramatically decreased levels ofIL-8 protein, mRNA and cell viability. These results shows.

Effects of dexamethasone on phosphorylation of p38 andERK1/2 MAPKs in TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cellsRecent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of theERK/p38 pathway in HT-29, HeLa, human airway epi-thelial, and mast cells attenuates IL-8 secretion [25\u201327].In the present study, we examined the effects of dexameth-asone on TNF-a-induced MAPK phosphorylation byAFig. 3.

Dexamethasone treat-ment was found to significantly inhibit TNF-a-inducedphosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the total levels ofthese kinases (Fig. 3).

Effects of dexamethasone on phosphorylation anddegradation of inhibitor-jB (IjB) in TNF-a-stimulatedhPDL cellsStimulation of cells with inducers such as TNF-a leadsto rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradationof IjB. Degradation of IjB allows NF-jB to translocate tothe nucleus, bind to its specific promoter elements, andactivate gene transcription. Since NF-jB activation isimportant for the regulation of IL-8 [28], we examinedthe effect of dexamethasone on TNF-a-induced NF-jBactivation. Cells were exposed to TNF-a for 15 min, celllysates were prepared, and IjB degradation and phosphor-ylation were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IjBaand anti-phospho-IjBa antibodies, respectively. IjBabecame almost undetectable 15 min after TNF-a treat-ment, and it returned to the original level 1 h after TNF-a treatment (Fig. 4A).We next examined whether dexamethasone had anyeffect on TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of IjBa pro-tein, inasmuch as IjBa phosphorylation is reported tobe important for IjB degradation [28]. Phosphorylationof IjB protein after TNF-a treatment was dramaticallyinhibited by dexamethasone, in a concentration-depen-dent manner (Fig. 4B).

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on IL-8 expression indexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cellsSince our results indicated that p38 and ERK are inhib-ited by TNF-a exposure, we next examined whether theseMAPKs are required for induction of pro-inflammatorygene expression by TNF-a. Cells were pre-treated with20 lM SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK) or20 lM PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of ERK kinase) for1 h. They were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-a and10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone for 24 h, supernatant fractionswere collected, and the amount of IL-8 protein secretedwas determined by ELISA (Fig. 5A).Pre-treatment of hPDL cells with either of the selectiveinhibitors for p38 (SB203580) or ERK kinase (PD98059)blocked TNF-a-induced IL-8 production (Fig. 5A). As seenin Fig. 5B, the level of secreted IL-8 protein correlated withthe level of accumulated IL-8 mRNA. With dexamethasone(10\ufffd7 M) treatment, the inhibitory effect of pre-treatment onIL-8 mRNA and protein expression was also noted (Fig. 5Aand B).

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on ICAM-1 expressionin dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cellsBecause of similarities in the kinetics of induction of IL-8 and ICAM-1 mRNA, and in the structures of the IL-8and ICAM-1 gene promoters, we hypothesized that MAP-Ks may also regulate ICAM-1 expression. Both IL-8 andICAM-1 mRNA were rapidly up-regulated in hPDL fol-lowing stimulation with TNF-a (Fig. 6A), but simulta-neous treatment with dexamethasone suppressed theinduction of ICAM-1 by TNF-a (Fig. 6A\u2013C).RT-PCR analysis indicated that pre-treatment of hPDLcells with SB203580 or PD98059 inhibited induction ofICAM-1 mRNA expression by TNF-a, with or withoutdexamethasone (Fig. 6A). The effects of MAPK inhibitorson the surface expression of ICAM-1 were also examinedby FACS analysis. The results of the FACS analysis, whichare shown in a conventional flow cytometric histogram ona log scale in Fig. 6B and C, are consistent with the RT-PCR analysis. SB203580 inhibited TNF-a-induced surfaceexpression of ICAM-1 in the presence and absence ofdexamethasone (Fig. 6B). PD98059 also blocked TNF-a-induced surface expression of ICAM-1 in the absence ofdexamethasone, but not in its presence (Fig. 6C). Theseresults suggest that the mechanisms by which dexametha-sone and TNF-a induce ICAM-1 expression do not involvethe tyrosine p38/ERK1/2 pathway in the same way.4.

They lose their osteoblast-like characteristics[29] and express genes that are associated with catabolicprocesses, including bone resorption, as evidenced bystudies on the mechanism of orthodontic tooth move-ment [29,30].Orthodontic tooth movement activates the secretion ofosteolytic cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a thatare produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts[13,14]. IL-8, which was originally identified as a mono-cyte-derived factor capable of attracting and activatingneutrophils, is increasingly being recognized as multifunc-tional. It appears to be important in the regulation of boneresorption, and its diverse functions have been investigatedin a variety of cell types [5,6]. However, the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids on IL-8 pro-duction in hPDL cells have not previously been studiedin detail.In the present study, we investigated the production andsecretion of IL-8 from hPDL cells that were treated withthe pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in the presenceand absence of dexamethasone. These treatments were cho-sen to mimic the inflammatory responses of bone resorp-tion during orthodontic tooth movement. IL-8 secretionwas significantly enhanced by treatment with TNF-a, in adose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B), andexpression of IL-8 mRNA was also enhanced, in a time-de-pendent manner (Fig. 1C and D). These results are inaccordance with those of previous studies using varioushuman cell types, including osteoclasts [8], endothelial cellsone and TNF-a stimulated PDL cells by RT-PCR (A), and FACS-analysis1 h, post-treated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and dexamethasone (10\ufffd7 M) forT-PCR.

Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376[15], and airway smooth-muscle cells [16], and they indicatethat TNF-a-dependent up-regulation of IL-8 is due to anincrease in transcription.One characteristic feature of many cytokines is that theiractions involve interactive networks or cascades that areoften stimulatory. However, our present data demonstratethat dexamethasone inhibits TNF-a-induced secretion ofIL-8 (Fig. 2A and B), providing an example, therefore, ofan equally interesting inhibitory interaction. In a previousstudy by Fujisawa et al. [31], dexamethasone was foundto have no effect on TNF-a-induced IL-8 production, butthis lack of effect may be related to the low concentrationof dexamethasone used. Additionally, we did not observea significant effect for dexamethasone at the concentration(10\ufffd9 M) used in their study; however, at higher concentra-tions (10\ufffd8 and 10\ufffd7 M), it significantly inhibited TNF-a-induced IL-8 production in our study, and in those ofRothe et al. [8], Nyhlen et al. [15], and Pang et al. [16].These results suggest that dexamethasone plays a impor-tant role in the regulation of bone remodeling and that thiseffect is due to inhibition of TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretionduring orthodontic tooth movement.IL-8 production in response to pro-inflammatory stimuliis dependent on MAPK- and NF-jB-mediated pathways[32]. NF-jB comprises specific, heterodimeric complexesthat are inactive in the cytoplasm of resting cells, whereeach NF-jB complex is bound to one of the IjB proteins.Stimulus-induced activation of the NF-jB-inducing kinasecauses it to phosphorylate the IjB kinase complexes [33].Ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation ofIjB follows, freeing NF-jB to translocate to the nucleus,where it interacts with its target DNA motifs and regulatesthe secretion of various chemokines, including IL-8 [33,34].IjB kinases are phosphorylated by NF-jB-inducingkinases, which activate various MAPKs, including thestress-activated protein kinase JNK [35]. Recently, theIL-6 and IL-8 genes have been identified as new targets reg-ulated by JNK [36]. Other studies have shown that (i)ERK1/2 and JNK play an important role in streptococcalprotein I/II-mediated synthesis of IL-6 and IL-8 in fibro-blast-like synoviocytes [37]; (ii) p38 MAPK plays a crucialrole in IL-6 and IL-8 production by TNF-a- or IL-1b-stim-ulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts [38]; and (iii) p38and ERK MAPKs contribute to TNF-a-stimulated IL-8secretion by intestinal epithelial cells [39].To investigate the connection between the activation ofp38 and ERK and induction of IL-8, we evaluated theeffects of JNK and ERK pathway inhibitors (SB203580and PD98059, respectively) and an anti-inflammatoryagent (dexamethasone) on NF-jB, MAPK activation,and IL-8 production in hPDL cells exposed to TNF-a.Dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated phosphoryla-tion of p38 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3), indicating a possible spe-cific interaction with the p38/ERK1/2 signal pathway.Moreover, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated IjBdegradation (Fig. 4) and NF-jB binding to DNA, provid-ing evidence that dexamethasone regulates expression ofthe pro-inflammatory target gene, IL-8, by suppressingthe NF-jB-activating signal pathway in hPDL cells.Although the importance of ERK1/2 in IL-8 expressionhas been described in previous studies [40,41], the role ofp38 MAPK in IL-8 expression is unclear. In a study by Rid-ley et al. [42], SB203580 had no effect on IL-8 expression inIL-1-stimulated human fibroblast or umbilical vein endothe-lial cells. On the other hand, in a study by Zu et al. [43], acti-vation of p38 MAPK was required for stimulation of IL-8production by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulatingfactor, lipopolysaccharide, or TNF-a in neutrophils. In thepresent study, both the p38 inhibitor and the ERK inhibitorefficiently blocked IL-8 protein production in response toTNF-a/dexamethasone, as shown by ELISA (Fig. 5A) andsemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Thus, the effect ofstimulating agents on IL-8 regulation appears to vary withcell type and the particular agent used.ICAM-1, a cell surface adhesion molecule, is involved inmany biological responses, including leukocyte adhesion toendothelial cells. It is expressed on several types of cells,including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and leukocytes,and it is up-regulated at sites of inflammation by pro-in-flammatory cytokines [44\u201346]. Evidence for ICAM-1expression in the PDL was reported by Toms et al. [47],who used immunohistochemical analysis to examine theeffect of endotoxin exposure on rat PDL blood vessels.Furthermore, Joe et al. [48] demonstrated that IL-1b causesup-regulation of ICAM-1 in PDL cells. However, whetherICAM-1 functions as a signaling molecule to transmit bio-chemical signals in hPDL cells remains unknown. In thepresent study using hDPL cells, we found that TNF-ainduces ICAM-1 expression, that dexamethasone signifi-cantly inhibits this response, and that this response is con-sistent with the effect of TNF-a on IL-8 (Fig. 6). Hence,this report constitutes the first description of a signalingrole for ICAM-1 in hPDL cells.Transformed intestinal epithelial cells have been shownto express IL-8 and ICAM-1 both constitutively and upontreatment with TNF-a [44,45], and p38 MAPK plays a rolein the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, such asIL-8, and adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 [23,46].Thus, we examined whether MAPKs regulate ICAM-1expression in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulatedhPDL cells at the level of translation or transcription.Interestingly, we found that SB203580 dramatically sup-presses ICAM-1 expression by hPDL cells exposed toTNF-a with or without dexamethasone, as shown bysemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A) and FACS analysis.PD98059 pretreatment blocked TNF-a-induced ICAM-1expression, whereas did not affect ICAM-1 expression incells simultaneously treated with TNF-a and dexametha-sone. According to Jijon et. al. [26], neither PD98059 norSB203580 reduced the number of ICAM-1 molecule fol-lowing TNF-a treatment on the intestinal epithelium. Thereason for this difference may reflect compensatory effectof dexamethasone for TNF-a, and may activate differenttarget MAP kinase in different cell types.H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 75The present study demonstrates that hPDL cells secretethe potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, and that TNF-a exposure stimulates production of IL-8 by these cells.Furthermore, dexamethasone inhibits the effect of TNF-aon IL-8 expression in these cells by blocking MAPKs andthe IjB/NF-jB pathway. The up- or down-regulation ofboth ICAM-1 and IL-8 in response to TNF-a or dexameth-asone appears to be mediated by p38 and ERK MAPKs.Thus, these factors may play an important role in theimmunoregulation of bone remodeling during orthodontictooth movement. Further studies elucidating the interac-tions among other osteotropic factors in hDPL cells shouldlead to techniques that will facilitate effective and rapidorthodontic tooth movement.References[1] Davidovitch Z.
