Chiba).Background and purpose: Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a major Th2 cytokine, plays an important role in bron-chial asthma, including mucus production, inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. AlthoughIL-13 through its binding to IL-4 receptor a (IL-4Ra/IL-13Ra1 uses the canonical signal transducer andactivator of transcription 6 (STAT6)-signaling pathway to mediate these tissue responses, recent studieshave demonstrated that other signaling pathways may also be involved in. In the present study, whetherIL-13 induces an activation of nuclear factor (NF)-jB, inflammatory transcription factor, was investigatedin human bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs). Methods: Nuclear proteins were extracted from cul-tured hBSMCs treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (10 ng/mL) or IL-13 (100 ng/mL), and assayedfor activated NF-jB and STAT6 by Western blotting. Result: Treatments with TNF-a and IL-13 induced atranslocation of NF-jB to nuclei in hBSMCs. In addition, coincubation with BMS-345541 (0.3 lM), aninhibitor of NF-jB (IjB) kinase (IKK) inhibitor, markedly inhibited the translocation of NF-jB. Conclusion:Our results suggest for the first time that IL-13 activates NF-jB in hBSMCs.\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionT helper 2 (Th2) cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 andIL-13 are important mediators of bronchial asthma, a complexchronic disease of the airways, which is characterized by airwayinflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness(AHR). In murine models of the asthmatic response, IL-13 has beenshown to be both necessary and sufficient for the generation ofasthma-like deleterious tissue alterations [1\u20134]. The mechanismsof these responses have not been fully defined. However, becauseIL-13 induces a greater number of genes in airway smooth muscleas compared with other lung cell types, including smooth musclemyosin light chain (MLC), phospholipase A2 and IL-13 receptora1 (IL-13Ra1), airway smooth muscle cells have the capacity to re-spond to direct stimulation by IL-13 [5].IL-13 binds to a polymeric receptor that contains IL-4Ra and IL-13Ra1 subunits. The majority of the studies of this receptor havefocused on its ability to induce signal transducer and activator oftranscription 6 (STAT6) tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequentsignaling. In murine models, IL-13 has been shown to mediatemany of its asthma-relevant responses through the activation ofthe STAT6 pathway in bronchial epithelial cells [6]. However, othersignal transduction pathways also contribute to the pathogenesisof asthma-like Th2 responses including airway hyperresponsive-ll rights reserved.ness and inflammation [7,8]. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) 1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is re-quired for optimal IL-13 stimulation of specific chemokines, matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs), and protease inhibitors in the murinelung [9].The nuclear transcription factor NF-jB, typical of p50 and p65heterodimer, regulates over 150 genes involved in immune andinflammatory responses. Current evidence suggests an essentialrole in NF-jB overactivation for increased expression of manyinflammatory genes and for airway inflammation in asthma[9,10]. One well established mechanism of NF-jB suppression isthe export of nuclear NF-jB by inhibitor of NF-jB (IjB) a, therebyrapidly repressing NF-jB activation [11]. In general, NF-jB hasbeen known to be activated through phosphorylation and degrada-tion of IjBa by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. However, it is re-ported that NF-jB is activated by not only TNF-a but also IL-1b,UV-light and stress and has an important role in the immune re-sponse including inflammation [12\u201314].We hypothesized that NF-jB plays a critical role in the patho-genesis of IL-13-induced signal transduction. To test this hypothe-sis, we investigated whether IL-13 induces an activation of NF-jBin human bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs). As the results,both TNF-a and IL-13 induced activations of NF-jB and STAT6,respectively. Interestingly, IL-13 also induced an activation of NF-jB, which was demonstrated by the NF-jB translocation to nuclei.These phenomena were significantly inhibited by combinationwith BMS-345541, IjB kinase (IKK) inhibitor. Therefore, our resultsmailto:chiba@hoshi.ac.jphttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666K.

ChemicalsAll biochemicals were of analytical grade and were purchasedfrom commercial suppliers: rhTNF-a (Peprotech, Paris, France),rhIL-13 (Peprotech, Paris, France) and BMS-345541 (Sigma, MO,USA).2.2. Cell cultureHuman bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs, Cambrex, MD,USA) were maintained in SmBM (Cambrex) medium supplementedwith 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mg/mL hFGF-B, 0.5 mg/mLhEGF, 5 mg/mL insulin and gentamycin/amphotericin B. The cellsplated at a density of 2.7 \ufffd 104 per one well of a 6-well dish inFBS. Cells were serum deprived for 24 h using serum-free medium,which consists of SmBM supplemented with gentamycin/ampho-tericin B. The culture technique was used in experiments involvingstimulation with 10 ng/mL TNF-a, 100 ng/mL IL-13 or sterile phos-phate buffered saline (PBS) as vehicle control for 30 min or 1 h.BMS-345541, IKK inhibitor, was coincubated with TNF-a or IL-13.2.3. Nuclear protein extractionCells were washed in PBS and lysed in 15 mM KCl, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.6),2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM phen-Phosphorylated STAT6Total STAT6012pSTAT6 / total STAT6ConFig. 1.

Proteins were extracted from nuclei byincubation at 4 \ufffdC with vigorous vortexing in buffer (420 mM NaCl,20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mMDTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2.5 lg/ml leupeptin, and 5 lg/ml aprotinin).Nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for30 min at 4 \ufffdC, and the supernatant extract was collected andstored at \u201385 \ufffdC until use.2.4. Western blot analysesTo determine the levels of p65 in nucleus of hBSMCs and thephosphorylated levels of STAT6 in hBSMCs, the samples (10 mgof total protein per lane) were subjected to 10 or 7.5% sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE),and the proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to apoly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking with3% skim milk or 3% gelatin, the PVDF membrane was incubatedwith polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-jB p65 (1:1000 dilution; Biolegend,San Diego, CA, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-STAT6 (1:1000 dilution;Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), or polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated STAT6 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz).Then the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500 dilution; AmershamBiosciences, Co., NJ, USA), detected by an enhanced chemilumines-cent system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by a densitom-etry system. Detection of house-keeping gene was also performedon the same membrane by using polyclonal rabbit anti-histone H1(1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz), or monoclonal mouse anti-b-actin(1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz) to confirm the same amount of pro-teins loaded.***t       IL-13(100 ng/mL)   TNF-(10 ng/mL)ced by TNF-a (10 ng/mL, 1 h) or IL-13 (100 ng/mL, 1 h) in cultured human bronchialted STAT6 by immunoblottings.

Statisticalsignificance of difference was determined by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Bon-ferroni/Dunn (StatView for Macintosh ver. 5.0, SAS Institute, Inc.,NC). A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant.3. ResultTo determine whether TNF-a and IL-13 are capable of activatingSTAT6 and NF-jB in hBSMCs, the levels of STAT6 phosphorylationand nuclear translocation of p65 were assessed byimmunoblottings.As shown in Fig. 1, IL-13 caused distinct phosphorylation ofSTAT6 in the hBSMCs: the level of phosphorylated STAT6 in theIL-13 (100 ng/mL)-treated cells was significantly increased as com-pared with that in the vehicle-treated control cells (p < 0.001). Onthe other hand, TNF-a (10 ng/mL) had no effect on the level ofSTAT6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1).Fig. 2 shows the effects of TNF-a and IL-13 on the level of nucle-ar p65 in hBSMCs. As widely reported in various types of cells, TNF-a (10 ng/mL) caused a significant increase in nuclear p65 level(Fig. 2; p < 0.01), i.e., translocation of p65 to nuclei, in hBSMCs.Interestingly, a significant increase in nuclear p65 was also ob-served in the cells treated with 100 ng/mL of IL-13 (Fig. 2;p < 0.05), suggesting that IL-13 is capable of activating not onlySTAT6 but also NF-jB in hBSMCs.Next, the effect of an IjB kinase (IKK) inhibitor, BMS-345541, onthe IL-13-induced translocation of p65 was investigated to deter-mine the role of IKK in the IL-13-induced activation of NF-jB. Asshown in Fig. 3, the TNF-a-induced translocation of p65 was com-pletely blocked by BMS-345541 (0.3 lM; p < 0.01).

DiscussionIL-13 is a Th2 cytokine that has emerged as a critical regulatorof inflammatory immune responses, with key roles in asthmaand parasite immunity [15,16]. IL-13 can be detected in the bron-chial tissue [17], nasal lavage fluid [18], and induced sputum [17]of asthmatics. Following segmental allergen challenge, bronchoal-veolar lavage (BAL) fluid contains IL-13 mRNA [19] and IL-13 pro-tein [20], indicating that the cytokine is generated in the lung inresponse to respiratory provocation. Transgene pulmonary overex-pression of IL-13 in mice is associated with several key pathologi-cal features of airways inflammation and remodeling, alsoobserved in patients with chronic severe asthma, including lym-phocyte and eosinophil accumulation, mucus cell metaplasia, sub-epithelial fibrosis and AHR [1]. Several studies indicate that IL-13may cause AHR independently of inflammation and it is plausiblethat the effect may result from a direct effect on airway smoothmuscle (ASM). ASM cells express functional IL-13 receptors andIL-13 is also linked to an augmented ASM contractility in rabbittracheal strips [21,22].IL-13 first binds to the IL-13Ra1 chain on the surface of cells. IL-4Ra is recruited upon IL-13 interaction with IL-13Ra1, to form thehigh affinity receptor complex [23]. Heterodimerization of cell sur-face IL-13Ra1 and IL-4Ra receptor chains initiates IL-13 signalingvia recruitment of janus kinase (JAK) 1, JAK2 and tyrosine kinase(Tyk) 2, resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT6, a critical stepin IL-13 and IL-4 dependent signaling [24].The present study demonstrated for the first time that not onlyTNF-a (10 ng/mL) but also IL-13 (100 ng/mL) induces translocationp65Histone H100.511.5Nuclear p65 / Histone H1Cont      IL-13(100 ng/mL)   TNF-(10 ng/mL)- + -- +BMS-345541 (0.3 \u00b5M)-+****++ #Fig. 3.

Putative mechanisms of activation of signal transducer and activator oftranscription 6 (STAT6) and NF-jB by IL-13 and TNF-a in hBSMCs. The currentfindings suggest that, in addition to the activation of STAT6 pathway, IL-13 alsoactivate NF-jB via an activation of IjB kinase (IKK, although the signaling betweenIL-13 receptors and IKK is not yet clear now.K. Goto et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 96\u201399 99of NF-jB to nuclei in hBSMCs. A complex composed of IKKs (IKKa,IKKb and IKKc) is an essential component in NF-jB-signalingmechanisms participating in IjBa phosphorylation. Although IKKaand IKKb are catalytic subunits, IKKc is a regulatory subunit. IKKbis essential for activation of the classical NF-jB pathway throughphosphorylation of serine residues 32 and 36 of IjBa, resultingin the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IjBa by the26S proteasome. The degradation of IjBa exposes a nuclear trans-location sequence facilitating translocation of NF-jB to the nu-cleus. In spite of treatment with TNF-a or IL-13, the expressionof total cellular p65 failed to show any change. Therefore, it isour judgment that upregulation of p65 in nuclei occurred by trans-location of NF-jB. Svetlana et al. [25] had demonstrated an activa-tion of NF-jB in mice when IL-13 was overexpressed in lungepithelia. In addition, Il-13-induced eosinophilia, inflammation,fibrosis, airway obstruction and alveolar remodeling were inhib-ited by interference with NF-jB activation [25]. In our works, IL-13 also activated NF-jB, and IL-13-induced translocation of NF-jB to nuclei was completely inhibited by BMS-345541 (0.3 lM),IKK inhibitor in hBSMCs. Because the TNF-a induced activation ofNF-jB is dependent on IKKb, we suggested that BMS-345541(0.3 lM) was perfectly inhibited IKK activity. Therefore, our resultindicated that IL-13 activates NF-jB via IKKb.In conclusion, we suggest for the first time that IL-13 activatesNF-jB via an activation of IKK in hBSMCs (Fig. 4). Therefore, be-cause the inhibition of NF-jB activity suppressed not only TNF-ainduced signaling but also IL-13 induced signaling partly, NF-jBinhibitor can be a therapeutic target for bronchial asthma.References[1] Zhu Z, Homer RJ, Wang Z, Chen Q, Geba GP, Wang J, et al.
