Liu, D. Gu, L. Sheng, Q. Wang and Y. ZhangState Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, ChinaIntroductionVibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio species, is a wide-spread threat to the marine culture and brings about hugeeconomic loss worldwide. There have been more than 10kinds of vibrios reported to be the causative agents in theuniversal marine culture at present, including Vibrio an-guillarum, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. harveyiand V. alginolyticus (Austin 2010). The genomes of allthese species have been sequenced and the information isavailable on GenBank. Yet only a small portion of thesegenes has been experimentally assigned a function.Genetic tools are essential for gene function analysisincluding the ectopic expression, the site-directed in-framedeletion, and the complementation. The discovery ofrestriction enzymes in the early 1970s led to the revolu-tionary progress in the analysis of nucleic acids. However,this traditional method takes much time for the restrictionenzyme digestion and ligation, meanwhile the process maybe hampered by the limited restriction enzyme siteslocated on the plasmid and versatile sites contained in thetarget DNA sequence. Furthermore, the efficiency ofobtaining positive clones is closely correlated to the effec-tiveness of the restriction enzyme digestion. It is thereforea burning need to expand the tools for high-throughputscreening and gene function analysis.Gateway technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) isa cloning technique based on site-specific recombinationKeywordsAsp, biofilm, gateway, T6SS, Vibrioalginolyticus.CorrespondenceQ.

The results illustrated that allthe mutant strains showed no significant effects on extracellular protease pro-duction, expression of Hcp1, and biofilm formation when compared to thewild-type strain, but in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0008 resulted in obvious bio-film reduction and the complemented strain restored to the level of thewild-type strain. Besides, in-frame deletion of dotU1, VEPGS_0008 and ppkA2abolished the swarming ability.Conclusions: A set of Gateway-compatible vectors for internal insertion,in-frame deletion and complementation of the target genes is constructed tofacilitate the general and rapid function analysis of genes involved in T6SS inVibrio alginolyticus.Significance and Impact of the Study: The modified Gateway-compatible plas-mids greatly facilitate the high-throughput and convenient function analysis ofthe unidentified genes.Letters in Applied Microbiology ISSN 0266-8254No claim to Chinese Government worksLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 73characteristics of the lambda bacteriophage (Landy 1989)that encompasses two opposite recombination reactions(BP and LR). The BP recombination reaction catalysed byBP clonase refers to the recombination reaction betweenattB sites in the target gene and attP sites carried on thedonor vector, resulting in the attL-containing entry plas-mid. Similarly, the attL-flanked target gene carried onentry plasmid can be transferred to various destinationvectors that contain homologous attR sites by the LRreaction catalysed by the LR clonase, generating the targetplasmid carrying the attB-flanked sequences. Gatewaytechnology avoids the labour-intensive restriction enzymedigestion and ligation process and enhances the efficiencyof getting positive strains for the presence of the counter-selective marker, CcdB. At present, Gateway cloning sys-tem has been successfully used for high-throughput genefunction analysis in various microorganisms (Dupuy et al.2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Yahata et al.2005).In this study, we have described the construction of aset of modified Gateway-compatible vectors and theirapplication in the rapid investigation of roles of type VIsecretion system (T6SS) genes in fish pathogen V. algino-lyticus. The Gateway-compatible vector derivatives arealso useful in gene function analysis in other vibrios andGram-negative bacteria.Materials and methodsVectors, bacterial strains, and culture conditionsThe vectors and strains utilized in the study are listed inTable 1.

Vibrio alginolytics strains were grown in LB med-ium containing 3% (w \u2044 v) NaCl at 30\ufffdC. The antibioticswere used at the following concentrations: 100 lg ml)1ampicillin (Amp) and 7 lg ml)1 chloramphenicol (Cm)for V. alginolaticus, 100 lg ml)1 Amp, 100 lg ml)1 kana-mycin (Km), and 25 lg ml)1 Cm for E. coli.Construction of the entry vectorsTo transfer the target genes to different destination vec-tors for diverse applications, a series of entry vectors car-rying the target genes on the donor vector, pDONR221(Invitrogen), were constructed. To generate the Hcp1expression strains, we amplified its open reading frame(ORF) using the forward primer Ghcp1F carrying theattB1 sites on the upstream of the 5\u00a2 end and the reverseprimer Ghcp1R carrying the attB2 sites (Table 2) fromthe genomic DNA of V. alginolyticus EPGS. Then the frag-ment was cloned into pDONR221 by BP reaction accord-ing to the instruction of the manufacturer (Invitrogen).To generate the in-frame deletion mutant strains forgene function analysis, primers containing the attB siteswere designed for the indicated genes. Here, threeT6SSVA1 genes (including dotU1, VEPGS_0008 and VE-PGS_0011) located on the chromosome I and twoT6SSVA2 genes (ppkA2 and hcp2) on chromosome II inV. alginolyticus were selected for in-frame deletion mutantconstruction based on the Gateway cloning technology.Taking dotU1 as an example, the genomic DNA of V. alg-inolyticus EPGS was used as a template with PCR primersTable 2 Primers used for cloning in thisstudyPrimers Sequences (5\u00a2\u20133\u00a2)*Ghcp1F ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATGCCAACTCCAGCATATATGhcp1R CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTAAGCTTCGCGTGGAGCAdotU11 ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGAGTTACGCAGAAACCGdotU12 AGATGTCTCAAGGGATCGAAGACATACAAdotU13 TCGATCCCTTGAGACATCTGGTGGTGACAdotU14 CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAGGTTGCCGCATACATAAhcp21 ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATAATTGGGAGTTGGTTChcp22 GAAGTGTTGTTTGTATTGCTCGGCTGTThcp23 AGCAATACAAACAACACTTCTGCTCCATTGhcp24 CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAGCTTTAGCACGCAATGADN081 ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTTACTACCACGGTCCAAGDN082 CTTCTTACCCTAACCAATGTTTCGGGATADN083 AAACATTGGTTAGGGTAAGAAGAATGATGTDN084 CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTGGTAATGGAGAAGGGAACDN111 ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTGTTCATTATCAACCGTTTAGCDN112 GAGTGAATGGACTTCAACCTTCGCAGCACDN113 GAAGGTTGAAGTCCATTCACTCGCATCTCDN114 CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT CGAATACCAAAGCCGAGTppkA21 ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGTTATTGGGCATGGTGGGppkA22 AATGCCGCTAATTAGCGGGCTTTAGGTCppkA23 GCCCGCTAATTAGCGGCATTGTATTTGGTTppkA24 CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGGTAGAGGGCTGTTGGAdotU1comF ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAGAAGTGAAGCCTGATGGdotU1R CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGCAAACTGCAATCTCTChcp2comF ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGTTATGGAGAAGGAGGTGhcp2comR CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT TATCGAATGGCGAAGAAADN08comF ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCAATGGTACAGCGAGATDN08comR CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTACCCAGGTGATAAAGACGDN11comF ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCTTTGGCCTAGACAGCTDN11comR CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTAACTTCGGATGATATTTGGppkA2comF ACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAAAAGCCGCAAGTTCACCppkA2comR CCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTACATACGGACGCCAGACpMDF CC TGCAGCCAAGCTTGAGACCACAACGGTTTCCCTCTpMDR GCCAGTGCCAAGCTTTTTCGGGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCTpDDF GCATGCGGGTAACCTGAGCTCGAGACCACAACGGTTTCCCTCTpDDR GTGGAATTCCCGGGAGAGCTCTTTCGGGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCT*Nucleotides underlined represent attB sites added to the 5\u00a2 end of the primers.H.

The fragment with 210-bp in-frame deletion ofthe dotU1 gene generated by overlap PCR was cloned intothe donor vector, pDONR221 with the BP reaction to getthe entry plasmid. Besides, for the construction of corre-sponding complemented strains, the sequences containingthe intact promoter regions and ORFs of the indicatedgenes were obtained by PCR with the designed primersharbouring attB sites and then transferred to thepDONR221 with BP reaction. The primers used for genecloning and plasmid construction are listed in Table 2.Construction of the destination vectorsTo create the Gateway-compatible plasmids, first, theattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified frompDEST17 (Invitrogen) with primers pDDF and pDDR,which covered 15-bp sequence homologous to either sideof the SalI site located on pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002)and pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996) at the 5\u00a2 end, SalI site inthe middle, and the specific sequence of the attR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette at the 3\u00a2 end. Then the fragmentwas cloned into SalI digested linearized pNQ705-1 andpDM4 respectively, to generate the destination plasmidspNQ705-1.DEST and pDM4.DEST for the mutant con-struction using the seamless cloning kit according to themanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Genescript, Shanghai, China).Likewise, the pMMB206.DEST was produced by insertingattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette amplified from pDEST17using primers pMDF and pMDR into the EcoRI digestedpMMB206 (Morales et al. 1991). All destination plasmidswere transformed into SM10 kpir strain that was resistantto the CcdB toxicity and also supported replication of thep protein required R6K plasmids such as pNQ705-1 andpDM4 for positive screening.Transfer of target genes into the destination vectorsAll the entry vectors and corresponding destination plas-mids were harvested from various hosts (Table 1). LRrecombination reaction was carried out according to themanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen) and the reactionmixture was then transformed into E. coli CC118 kpir (Den-nis and Zylstra 1998). The destination vectors carrying thetarget sequences were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.Screening of target gene deletion mutantsIn-frame deletion mutants were constructed in theselected genes by double-crossover allelic exchangesaccording to previous protocols (Liu et al. 2011).Western-blot analysis of Hcp1 and AspTo detect the production of Hcp1 and Asp, Western-blotwas carried according to the previous work (Sheng et al.2012).Extracellular protease activity, biofilm formation, motil-ity assay, and LD50 determinationThe extracellular product (ECP) production assays deter-mined with hide powder azure (HPA) digestion assay andmilk plate assay, biofilm formation, motility assay, andLD50 determination with healthy zebrafish were carriedout according to the previously described methods (Liuet al. 2011).Aggregation assayOvernight cultures of all the tested strains were harvestedand normalized to the same OD600 values in 5 ml LBSbroth in glass test tubes. All the tubes were shaken vigor-ously first and then cultured statically at room tempera-ture for 10 min. Afterwards, OD600 of each strain wasassayed to determine the aggregation.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using Student\u2019st-test (spss 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsConstruction of the Gateway-compatible destinationvectorsThe plasmid pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002) used for inser-tion mutation construction, pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996)for in-frame deletion mutant construction, and pMMB206(Morales et al. 1991) for complementation constructionare widely used for the construction of mutant and com-plemented strains. They carried defined restriction enzymesites, and thus the flexibility was limited. Besides, all theabove plasmids are recalcitrant to be definitely digested orobserved to show smearing on agarose gel (H. Liu, D. Guand Q.Y. Wang, unpublished data). Thus, it is difficultand time-consuming for gene cloning using these plas-mids with the conventional method of restriction enzymedigestion and ligation. To circumvent these limitations,we set to modify the plasmids to make them compatiblefor using with the Gateway system (Invitrogen). TheattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified frompDEST17 (Invitrogen) using the primers with the additionof the 21-bp consensus sequence to the defined sequencesGateway plasmids for genetic analysis H. Liu et al.76 Letters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied MicrobiologyNo claim to Chinese Government worksof pDM4, pNQ705-1, and pMMB206 plasmids respec-tively (Fig. 1) and then moved onto these plasmids byseamless cloning method (Genescript). The desired desti-nation plasmids maintained in E. coli SM10 kpir strainthat was resistant to the toxic effect of CcdB and mean-while supplied the pir-encoded p protein for replication ofR6K plasmids (e.g. pNQ705-1 and pDM4) (Table 1) wereselected on the plates containing the indicated antibiotics.The sequencing results confirmed the presence and thevalidity of the attR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette in alltested strains. Therefore a set of Gateway-compatible plas-mids for convenient and systemic gene function analy-sis, including pNQ705-1.DEST, pDM4.DEST, andpMMB206.DEST, was successfully constructed.Expression of Hcp1 based on Gateway destination plas-mid pDEST17To evaluate the Gateway-based cloning technology, wecloned the ORF sequences of hcp1 (the hallmark of theT6SS in V. alginolyticus) into the donor vectorpDONR221 (Invitrogen) to generate the entry plasmid.Then the ORF of hcp1 was transferred from the entry vec-tor into the destination vector, pDEST17 (Invitrogen),which contains the strong bacteriophage T7 promoter forthe controlled and inducible expression of the proteins ofinterest and 6 \u00b7 His at the N-terminal of the specificsequence for the convenient purification, by LR reactionto obtain the expression plasmid. The efficiency of recov-ering desired clones was high (49 \u2044 50 positive, data notshown). However, 25-bp attB sites remained flanking theORF of hcp1 (Fig. 2a). To verify the expression of Hcp1based on Gateway system, the Hcp1 expression wasinduced by adding isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG) when the OD600 reached 0\u00c64. Then the total pro-teins were harvested and loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE.The result demonstrated that Hcp1 was expressed success-fully by using the Gateway-based plasmids and the pres-ence of the attB sites seems to exert no effect on thenormal expression of Hcp1 (Fig. 2b). The expression ofHcp1 utilizing pDEST17 was also verified by Western-blotusing Hcp1-specific antibody (Sheng et al. 2012)(Fig. 2b). Taken together, the protein expression can beachieved rapidly and efficiently with Gateway technology.Functional analysis of T6SS genes using Gateway-com-patible plasmidsTo validate and evaluate the Gateway-compatible plas-mids for mutant construction, five genes involved inT6SS in V. alginolyticus were selected to generate the in-frame deletion mutants. The process avoided the restric-tion enzyme selection, and the transfer efficiency of thetarget genes into the destination plasmids reached 90\u2013100%. All the five in-frame deletion mutant strains wereobtained successfully following the double-crossover alle-lic exchanges according to previous protocols (Liu et al.2011). Meanwhile, all the complemented strains were alsogenerated successfully using Gateway-compatible plasmidpMMB206.DEST. Thus the Gateway-compatible plasmidsapparently facilitate the genetic analysis (Fig. 3a).

Liu et al. Gateway plasmids for genetic analysisNo claim to Chinese Government worksLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 77mutation of the target genes was also achieved in V. algi-nolyticus (data not shown).The T6SS has been linked to a myriad of processes,including biofilm formation (Aschtgen et al. 2008), motil-ity (Jana et al. 2011), extracellular protease production(Weber et al. 2009), and promoting or limiting virulence(Filloux 2009). Here in, all the five obtained mutant strainsbased on Gateway-compatible plasmids were analysed fortheir roles in regulating the virulence-related elements,including motility, extracellular protease production,biofilm formation, and T6SS hallmark Hcp1 secretion inV. alginolyticus. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3, there wereno significant differences in swimming and aggregation inall tested strains, but DdotU1, DN08 harbouring in-framedeletion of VEPGS_0008 gene, and DppkA2 lost theswarming ability. The extracellular protease production inthe mutant strains displayed no significant difference incomparison with the wild-type strain. However, DN11strain, which carried in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0011gene, exhibited almost 50% reduction in extracellular pro-tease production. Unfortunately, the complemented straindid not fully restore to the level of the wild-type strain(Fig. 3b).Besides, the biofilm assay results revealed that all thefive mutant strains, except DN08, showed comparablelevel of biofilm production to that of the wild-type strain.The biofilm was almost invisible in DN08 strain andrestored to the level observed in the wild-type when theintact gene was introduced into DN08, confirming thecrucial roles of VEPGS_0008 gene in biofilm formation inV. alginolyticus. For Hcp1 production assay, there are nodissimilarities in all these five mutant strains comparedwith the wild-type strain when the whole cell lysates wereprobed with Hcp1-specific antibody. However, no visibleband against Hcp1 was present in any of the five mutantstrains when the concentrated supernatants were con-ducted. In contrast, very weak and apparent Hcp1 secre-tion could be respectively detected in the wild-type strainand the DpppA mutant strain as previously described(Sheng et al. 2012) (Fig. 3d).The zebrafish infection experiment was further per-formed to evaluate the impact of the five genes on thevirulence of V. alginolyticus. The fish infected with a highdose (3\u00c65 \u00b7 107 CFU per fish) of the wild-type and thefive mutant strains died within 24 h. At the dose of3\u00c65 \u00b7 106 CFU per fish and 3\u00c65 \u00b7 105 CFU per fish, themortality of the zebrafish reached 90% in 48 h and 60\u201370% in 96 h respectively. All the dead fish exhibited typi-cal haemorrhagic septicaemia. The LD50 values of themutant strains and the wild-type were calculated andthere were no significant attenuation in the five mutantstrains compared to the wild-type strain (Table 3).DiscussionGateway cloning system has been commonly utilized forhigh-throughput characterization of ORFs in single stan-dard frame in organisms, including E. coli, Saccharomycescerevisiae, plants, and Caenorhabditis elegans (Dupuy et al.2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Earley et al.2006; Alberti et al. 2007).

Thesedata illustrated that the Gateway plasmid and the Gate-way-compatible plasmids constructed in this study can beused to facilitate systemic and even high-throughput func-tional study on novel genes. We confirmed that the use ofthese Gateway-compatible plasmids has greatly facilitatedstreamlined traditional day-to-day molecular cloning pro-jects in which the restriction enzyme selection, the diges-tion activity, and the ligation efficiency have to be takeninto account and usually become the limiting factors forsuccessful construction and that it made the proceduremore rapid, convenient, and efficient in characterization ofgenes of interest in V. alginolyticus. Besides, this Gateway-compatible cloning system was also applied successfullyin V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus and Edwardsiellatarda collected in our laboratory (data not shown).T6SS is essential for bacterial pathogenesis. Yet theoverall virulence regulation architecture of the T6SS is notwell known until now. In this study, the roles of five T6SSgenes in the virulence regulation of V. alginolyticus weredetermined by the extracellular protease production, bio-film formation, motility, and Hcp1 secretion. The resultsshowed no significant differences in the tested strains incontrast with wild-type strain in Asp production exceptDN11, which exhibited 50% decrease in extracellular pro-tease production. VEPGS_0011 encodes a putative T6SSlysozyme-related protein and belongs to gp25 family. TheDN08 strain was unexpectedly inefficient in the biofilmformation and swarming ability. VEPGS_0008 encodes aputative transcriptional regulator belonging to AsnC fam-ily, which regulates the cell metabolism in response to theexogenous amino acid and has not been well characterizedso far. Its roles in T6SS and virulence regulation are notclear. Besides, DdotU1 and DppkA2 displayed no swarm-ing ability. The dotU1 gene encodes a transmembraneprotein while PpkA2 is annotated as a serine \u2044 threonineprotein kinase. At present, the detailed investigation ofthe functions of these five genes is underway in our labo-ratory. The secretion of Hcp1 was absent in all fivemutant strains and their complemented strains. This maybe caused by the tight post-translational regulation ofPpkA \u2044 PppA system in which PpkA is established to berequired for assembly of the T6SS and secretion of Hcpand its activity is antagonized by PppA (Mougous et al.2007), for the secretion of Hcp1 was enhanced remarkablyin DpppA strain (Fig. 3d). The influence of the T6SS com-ponents on Hcp1 secretion should be further assayed inthe strain with DpppA genetic background.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (no. 30901113) and Shanghai Lead-ing Academic Discipline Project (no.
