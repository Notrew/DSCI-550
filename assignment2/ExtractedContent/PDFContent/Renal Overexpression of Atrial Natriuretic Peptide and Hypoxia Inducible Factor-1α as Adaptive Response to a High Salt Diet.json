Both atrial natriureticpeptide (ANP) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1\ud835\udefc) exert cytoprotective effects. We tested the hypothesis that renal expressionof ANP and HIF-1\ud835\udefc is involved in a mechanism responding to the oxidative stress produced in the kidneys of rats chronically fed ahigh sodium diet. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a normal salt (0.4%NaCl) (NS) or a high salt (8%NaCl) (HS) diet for 3 weeks,with or without the administration of tempol (T), an inhibitor of oxidative stress, in the drinking water. We measured the meanarterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary sodium excretion (UVNa). We evaluated the expression ofANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and transforming growth factor (TGF-\ud835\udefd1) in renal tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The animalsfed a high salt diet showed increased MAP and UVNa levels and enhanced renal immunostaining of ANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1.The administration of tempol together with the sodium overload increased the natriuresis further and prevented the elevation ofblood pressure and the increased expression of ANP, TGF-\ud835\udefd1, and HIF-1\ud835\udefc compared to their control. These findings suggest thatHIF-1\ud835\udefc and ANP, synthesized by the kidney, are involved in an adaptive mechanism in response to a sodium overload to preventor attenuate the deleterious effects of the oxidative stress and the hypoxia on the development of fibrosis.1. IntroductionReactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstratedto play an important pathophysiological role in the kid-ney [1\u20134]. ROS can activate the mitochondrial uncouplingprotein 2 (UCP-2), leading to inefficient renal O2usageand contributing to renal hypoxia [5]. Changes in cellularoxygen concentrations induce tightly regulated responsepathways that attempt to restore oxygen supply to cellsand modulate cell function in hypoxic conditions. Most ofthese responses occur through the induction of the tran-scription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) whichcoordinates the expression of diverse adaptive genes againstthe hypoxic injury [6, 7]. HIF-1 transcriptionally upregulatesthe expression of metabolic proteins (GLUT-1), adhesionproteins (integrins), soluble growth factors (TGF-\ud835\udefd andVEGF), and extracellularmatrix components (type I collagenand fibronectin), which enhance the repair process. For thesereasons, HIF-1 is viewed as a positive regulator of organ repairand tissue fibrosis [8, 9].Hindawi Publishing CorporationBioMed Research InternationalVolume 2014, Article ID 936978, 10 pageshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/936978http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/9369782 BioMed Research InternationalIn the kidney, a predominant enzyme involved inoxidative stress development is NADPH-oxidase, whichis upregulated by increased sodium tubular transport,luminal flow, or cytokines release [10, 11]. In turn, thesuperoxide anion increases tubular NaCl transport, fur-ther enhancing oxidative stress [12]. It is well known thata high salt intake increases the oxidative stress in thekidneys of normal and salt-sensitive rats [1\u20134]. In thisregard, we have reported that a high salt diet in Sprague-Dawley rats is able to increase the oxidative stress. Wealso showed that the administration of tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl), which is a permeatesuperoxide dismutase mimetic commonly used to inhibit theoxidative stress, prevented those changes and produced apotent natriuretic and diuretic effect. Thus, we concludedthat the increase of the oxidative stress induced by sodiumoverload could account for antinatriuresis [1]. It has alsobeen described that, in models of experimental salt-sensitivehypertension, tempol improved the renal hemodynamicresponse and electrolyte excretory function, while abolish-ing salt-sensitive hypertension and renal oxidative stress[13].A growing number of mammalian genes have beenidentified to play a key role in the cellular adaptive responseto counter-regulate the renal hypoxia and the consequentprocess of fibrosis, among which is atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP). ANP is a member of a natriuretic peptide familywhich, besides its role in the regulation of volume homeosta-sis, has been noted to exert protective effects in several celltypes in response to oxidative stress [14] and fibrosis [15] andon the adaptation to hypoxia [16].Based on these data, we hypothesized that endogenousrenal ANP andHIF-1\ud835\udefc could constitute endogenous adaptivemechanisms in response to the oxidative stress produced inthe kidney of rats chronically fed with a high sodium diet.Therefore, in the current study we determined the effectof a high-salt diet on the regulation of renal expressionof HIF-1\ud835\udefc, ANP, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in Sprague-Dawley rats. Inaddition, we evaluated whether tempol administration, byinhibiting oxidative stress, prevents the increase of thesemolecules. Understanding these endogenous mechanismscan lead to finding a better therapeutic approach in salt-sensitive hypertension.2. Methods2.1. Animal Protocol and ExperimentalMeasurements. Exper-iments were conducted in accordance with the care and useof research animals of international guiding principles andlocal regulations concerning the care and use of laboratoryanimals for biomedical research (ANMAT, 6344/96; Instituteof Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996) (14), as well as the\u201cInternational Ethical Guiding Principles for BiomedicalResearch onAnimals\u201d established by theCIOMS (Council forInternational Organizations of Medical Sciences) (15). Theseprotocols were approved by Universidad de Buenos Aires(UBACYT B113) and the National Scientific and TechnicalResearch Council (CONICET, PIP 1337/09).Male Sprague Dawley rats, 5-6 weeks old (180\u2013200 g bodyweight), were used in the experiments. The animals werehoused in steel cages in a controlled temperature animalroom at 23 \u00b1 2\u2218C, exposed to a daily 12-hour light-darkcycle (light on from 07:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m.), fed the dietsdescribed below for three weeks, andwere given free access totap water. The experiments were performed in rats randomlydivided into four groups (\ud835\udc5b = 6 for each group): (a) NS(control): fed a normal salt diet (0.4 g% NaCl); (b) HS:fed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl); (c) NS-T: fed a normalsalt diet (0.4 g% NaCl) plus 1mM tempol (Sigma-AldrichInc, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), administered in the drinkingwater; (d) HS-T: fed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl) plus 1mMtempol administered in the drinking water. After 3 weeks,the rats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with urethane(1.2 g\u22c5kg\u22121) and a PE-90 tube (3 cm long) was inserted intothe trachea to maintain an open airway. The left femoral veinwas catheterized with a Silastic cannula (0.12mm i.d.) forcontinuous infusion.The right carotid arterywas catheterizedwith a T4 tube for blood sampling and for continuous meanarterial pressure recording (MAP) by means of a StathamGOULD P23ID transducer coupled to a Grass Polygraph79D during all the procedures. The bladder was cannulatedfor urine collection using a PE-75 cannula. A femoral veininfusion with isotonic saline solution (ISS, 0.15M NaCl)was performed at a rate of 0.04mL\u22c5min\u22121 (Syringe InfusionPump, Sage, Orion) for 60 minutes to allow for a steadydiuresis and to permit urine collection in all groups.Then, ISSinfusion continued for another 60min at the same rate duringthe experimental period. From each animal, a blood samplewas collected at 30 minutes and a urine sample was collectedfrom 0 to 60 minutes for sodium, potassium, and creatininemeasurements. At the end of the experimental period, otherblood samples were obtained from the abdominal cava vein,immediately placed into plastic tubes containing 15% EDTA,and kept on ice for ANP dosage. The kidney was rapidlyexcised, decapsulated, longitudinally cut, and harvested forimmunohistochemical studies.2.2. ANP Radioimmunoassay. The plasma ANP extractionprocedure was followed as described by Cavallero et al.[17]. The radioimmunoassay (RIA) was performed usingan ANP-rat RIA commercial kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,Burlingame, CA) [18].2.3. Urine and Blood Measurements. Urinary and plasmasodium and creatinine were measured by standard methodsusing an autoanalyzer. Creatinine clearance was assessedin order to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).GFR and sodium fractional excretion (FENa) were calculatedaccording to a standard formula. Urinary flow (UV) isexpressed as \ud835\udf07L\u22c5min\u22121, plasmatic sodium (PLNa) concen-tration as mEq\u22c5L\u22121, sodium urinary excretion (UVNa) as\ud835\udf07mol\u22c5min\u22121, GFR as mL\u22c5min\u22121, and FENa as percentage.2.4. Kidney Processing for Histological Examination. Renaltissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehydeBioMed Research International 3(pH 7.20) and embedded in paraffin. For immunohisto-chemistry, sections were deparaffinated and rehydrated, andendogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatmentwith 0.5% H2O2in methanol for 20 minutes. Local ANP,HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1 were detected using the followingspecific antibodies: rabbit anti-ANP (Phoenix Pharmaceuti-cal; dilution 1 : 500), rabbit anti-HIF-1\ud835\udefc (Novus Biologicals,Inc., Littleton, CO; dilution 1 : 1000), and rabbit anti-TGF-\ud835\udefd1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution 1 : 200). Immunos-taining was performed with a commercial modified avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique (Vectastain ABC kit,Universal Elite, Vector Laboratories, CA) and with coun-terstaining with haematoxylin. Histological sections wereobserved in a Nikon E400 light microscope (Nikon Instru-ment Group, Melville, New York, USA). All measurementswere carried out using image analysis software (Image-ProPlus ver. 4.5 for Windows, Media Cybernetics, LP. SilverSpring,MD,USA). Immunoreactivities for ANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, andTGF-\ud835\udefd1 are expressed as percentage of positive stained area\u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) in proximal convolutedtubules (PT), distal tubules (DT), thick ascending limb of theloop of Henle (THAL), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), andmedullary collecting ducts (MCD). Tissue samples of all theanimals were evaluated in a blinded fashion and separately bytwo researchers regarding knowledge of treatments.2.4.1. Preparation of RenalHomogenates forWestern Blot. Theright kidney from all groups was extracted, dissected, andseparated. Tissue samples were homogenized on ice witha Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products Inc.) in a buffer mix-ture (50mmol\u22c5L\u22121 Tris, 0.1mmol\u22c5L\u22121 EDTA, 0.1mmol\u22c5L\u22121EGTA, 1% Triton, 1mmol\u22c5L\u22121 PMSF, 1 \ud835\udf07mol\u22c5L\u22121 pepstatin,2 \ud835\udf07mol\u22c5L\u22121 leupeptin, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail(Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentration in the Triton-soluble supernatant was determined by the Lowry technique.2.4.2. Western Blot Analysis for HIF-1\ud835\udefc and ANP. Pooledsamples of renal tissue from five animals of each group andcontaining similar amounts of protein (150\ud835\udf07g protein/lane)were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS polyacry-lamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a nitrocellulosemembrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with mouse polyclonalanti-ANP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. 1 : 800 dilution)or rabbit monoclonal-anti-HIF-1\ud835\udefc (Abcam; 1 : 1000 dilution).For ANP, a secondary immune reaction followed with agoat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugated with horseradishperoxidase (dilution of 1 : 10000). For HIF-1\ud835\udefc a secondaryimmunereaction followed with a biotinylated anti-rabbit(dilution of 1 : 1000) and a 3rd antibody conjugated withhorseradish peroxidase (dilution of 1 : 1000). The sampleswere revealed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2\u20134min. The densityof the respective bands was quantified by densitometricscanning of Western blots using a Hewlett-Packard scannerandTotallab analyzer software (BiodynamicsCorp.). To avoidinaccuracies in protein loading, beta-tubulin was measuredas internal standard (anti-beta tubulin, Ab 6046, rabbitpolyclonal antibody) for each blot and protein levels werecalculated and expressed as the ratio between the opticaldensities of the bands corresponding to ANP or HIF-1\ud835\udefc and\ud835\udefd-tubulin.2.5. Statistical Analysis. Results from urine and blood mea-surements andMAP are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Gaussiandistribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov and Smirnovmethod and the comparison among groups was carried outusing ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test. \ud835\udc43 values <0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. Body Weight and Mean Arterial Pressure. There were nosignificant differences in body weight between control andexperimental groups (grams; NS: 330 \u00b1 9; HS: 320 \u00b1 6; NS-T: 314 \u00b1 13; HS-T: 320 \u00b1 7).TheMAPwas increased in the HS fed group compared tothe NS-fed group (mmHg; NS: 94 \u00b1 3 versus HS: 107 \u00b1 3\u2217).Tempol administration did not modify MAP levels in NSanimals but normalized MAP in the HS-T group, reachingMAP levels very similar to those observed inNS rats (mmHg;NS-T: 97 \u00b1 2 versus HS-T: 95 \u00b1 3\u2020) \u2217\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versusrespective NS group, \u2020\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus respective groupwithout tempol.3.2. Plasma Sodium and Urinary Sodium Excretion (Table 1).High salt diet and tempol administration did not alter plasmasodium in any experimental group.The administration of a high salt diet did not alterthe GFR, which was increased by tempol in HS-T groupwith respect to the HS group. Tempol administration alsoincreased GFR in the NS-T group as compared with the NSgroup.The administration of a high salt diet led to a greaterUVNa, which was further increased in HS-T group withrespect to the NS-T and HS groups. Moreover, tempolincreased UVNa in NS fed rats.The administration of a high salt diet raised FENa in HSgroup with respect to the NS group. Tempol administrationincreased the FENa further in the HS-T group as comparedwith NS-T and to the HS group. FENa was not altered in theNS-T group.3.3. Plasmatic ANP. Plasma ANP concentration (pg\u22c5mL\u22121)did not differ significantly between the NS (325.75 \u00b1 66.69)and HS (260.00 \u00b1 7.38) groups, as measured by RIA.3.4. Intrarenal ANP Expression.

Figure 6 shows quantifiedlevels of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 immunoexpression in renal tissues. Repre-sentative images of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 positive staining are shown inFigure 7 in (a) renal cortex and (b) renal medulla. Immunos-taining analysis of renal sections revealed increased positivestaining for TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in glomeruli, THAL, CCD, and theMCDin HS group, with respect to the NS group. Tempol did notshow additional effects in the NS-T group as compared withits control and prevented the increase of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 staining inHS-T group.4. DiscussionOur results showed that a high salt diet in normal rats resultedin a greater ANP expression in glomeruli, THAL and CCD,where the profibrotic marker TGF-\ud835\udefd1 was also increased.In addition, enhanced HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression was observed notonly in the renal medulla as it has been previously described[19], but also in renal cortex. We found that tempol admin-istration, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, favored urinarysodium excretion, prevented the increase of ANP and TGF-\ud835\udefd1 expression, and normalized HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression, the latterexcept in THAL. Western blot analysis confirmed our data,showing increased positive staining of HS group for ANPand HIF-1\ud835\udefd and decreased the expression of tempol groupscompared to their respective controls. These results suggestthat increased ANP and HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression in renal cortexand medulla could be involved in an adaptive response to theoxidative stress resulting from a high salt diet.As we have previously reported, a chronic salt overload(8% NaCl diet during 3 weeks) does not alter body weightor plasma sodium but causes higher MAP levels as wellas urinary sodium excretion [1]. Even though the animalsused in this study have their blood pressure taken underanesthesia, we have recently reported the same effect of ahigh salt diet on theMAP in conscious animals [20], allowingus to conclude that the anesthesia does not affect the bloodpressure when the different diet groups are compared. On theother hand, the administration of tempol normalized MAPlevels observed in the HS group, and it also increased furtherurinary sodium excretion. These results are in agreementwith previous studies, where treatmentwith tempol improvedrenal hemodynamic and electrolyte excretory function insalt-sensitive hypertension models [1, 21]. The effects oftempol, promoting natriuresis and preventing endogenousincrease of ANP, could suggest that, by inhibiting oxidativestress, tubular sodium transport decreases and thus preventsthe endogenous ANP expression as natriuretic hormone.However, we observed a clear raise in ANP expressionalso in glomeruli from rats fed a high salt diet, in whichsodium transport does not occur. Therefore, in addition toa natriuretic effect, endogenous ANP could be exerting othereffects in glomeruli and tubules. Furthermore, the increaseof renal ANP levels coincided with TGF-\ud835\udefd1 over-expressionin glomeruli, THAL and CCD. In this regard, it is knownthat TGF-\ud835\udefd1 upregulates the transcription of the serum andglucocorticoid-dependent kinase hSGK1, involved in the reg-ulation of two important factors for cell volume regulation,that is, the renal epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and the thickascending limb Na+, K+, and 2Cl\u2212 cotransporter NKCC[22]. The increase of cell volume stimulates protein synthesisand inhibits protein degradation, contributing to enhancingthe net formation and deposition of matrix proteins. Inaddition, TGF-\ud835\udefd1 transduces intracellular signals throughtype 1 (TGF-\ud835\udefdR1) and type 2 (TGF-\ud835\udefdR2) receptors, via thenuclear translocation of Smad3 proteins, thus contributingto a fibrotic response [23]. It has been demonstrated thatthe activation of ANP/cGMP/PKG signaling phosphorylatesSmad3 and disrupts TGF-\ud835\udefd1-induced nuclear translocationof pSmad3 and later downstream events, including myofi-broblast transformation and the proliferation and expressionof extracellular matrix molecules [24, 25]. Moreover, wehave previously demonstrated that an increase in TGF-\ud835\udefd1 expression produced by an acute saline overload wasprevented and reversed by the administration of low andnonhypotensive doses of ANP [26]. Taking this into account,8 BioMed Research InternationalFigure 6:Quantitative representation of positive intrarenal transforming growth factor (TGF-\ud835\udefd1) immunostaining/\ud835\udf07m2.

NS: normal saltdiet group, HS: high salt diet group, NS-T: normal salt diet plus tempol group, HS-T: high salt diet plus tempol group, PT: proximal tubule,CCD: cortical collecting duct, THAL: thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and MCD: medullary collecting duct.the present results suggest that the raise of ANP expression inrats fed a high salt diet could constitute a counter-regulatorymechanism against antinatriuretic and/or profibrotic TGF-\ud835\udefd1actions.Meanwhile, the plasmatic concentration of ANP was notaffected by dietary salt, suggesting that these animals did notchange cardiac ANP secretion [17]. Several reports provideevidence that plasmatic ANP increases after a chronic saltloading given by drinking 1\u201318% NaCl solutions [27, 28]or by a rat chow with high salt content [29]. However, theliterature also shows conflicting results reporting that ANPmRNA expression and circulating levels of ANP remainedunaltered after the ingestion of high sodium diets [30]. Thepresent results show that renal ANP expression levels areindependent of circulating ANP levels and are subjected toa different regulation. These findings are in accordance withSun et al. who have previously demonstrated that a dietarysalt supplementation may selectively increase ANP levels inthe kidney by downregulating its clearance receptor (NPR-C)[31].BioMed Research International 9NS HSNS-T HS-TGGGGGG(a)NS HSNS-T HS-TMCDMCDMCDMCD(b)Figure 7: (a) Representative images of positive staining of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in renal cortex.

NS: normal salt diet group, HS: high salt diet group, NS-T: normal salt diet plus tempol group,HS-T: high salt diet plus tempol group, G: glomerulus, and MCD: medullary collecting duct.Our study also shows that a high salt intake increasedHIF-1\ud835\udefc expressionnot only in the renalmedulla, as it has beendescribed before [18], but also in renal cortex. Consideringthat a high salt intake increases oxidative stress, renal tubulartransport, and hypoxia, it may constitute one of the possiblefactors involved in the upregulation of HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression inrenal tissues [6, 32]. Additionally, it has been reported that ahigh salt intake inhibits PHD-2 expression, the predominantisoform in renal medulla of prolyl-hydroxylase enzyme,which promotes the degradation of HIF-1\ud835\udefc, increasing itsexpression level [33]. In this way, recent studies have shownthat HIF-1\ud835\udefc may regulate the encoding genes of someenzymes in the THAL, as those of nitric oxide synthase(NOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1), which are highly expressed in renal medulla [34,35]. However, the tempol administration, which preventsoxidative stress and enhanced urinary sodium excretion,normalized HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression in the HS group, except inTHAL from both groups fed a normal or a high salt diet.These data suggest that tempol could prevent the hypoxiaproduced by the oxidative stress as it has been described[5, 20], but not the hypoxia produced by greater sodiumtransport in THAL, where the enhancement of sodiumreabsorption in this tubular segment may be compensat-ing the inhibition of sodium transport in PT, elicited bytempol.In summary, the present findings suggest that HIF-1\ud835\udefcand ANP could represent a main adaptive mechanism innormal rats, in response to a salt overload, counter-regulatingthe hypoxia and fibrosis produced by oxidative stress, andplaying a crucial role in the maintenance of sodium balance.The administration of tempol, as a scavenger of superoxideanion, prevents overexpression of \ud835\udefc and ANP.The disruptionof this salt adaptive pathway in salt-sensitive rats could bethe cause of sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation,and fibrosis in these animals. The pharmacological poten-tiation of endogenous ANP may be a therapeutic approachfor the management of oxidative stress in salt-sensitivehypertension.Conflict of InterestsThe authors do not have direct financial conflict of interests.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by Grants from the ConsejoNacional de Investigaciones Cient\u0301\u0131ficas y Te\u0301cnicas (NationalCouncil for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina)(CONICET PIP 112-1337) and Universidad de Buenos Aires(UBACYT 2002010100688).References[1] M.
