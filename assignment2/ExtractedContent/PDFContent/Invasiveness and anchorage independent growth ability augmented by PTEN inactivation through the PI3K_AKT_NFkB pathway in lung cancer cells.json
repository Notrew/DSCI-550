IntroductionThe PTEN (phosphates and tensin homologue deleted on chro-osome 10) tumor suppressor gene is frequently deleted orutated in a wide variety of human cancers, including glioblas-oma [1],  melanoma [2],  prostate cancer [3],  breast cancer [4],ung cancer [5],  and endometrial cancer [6].  In addition, PTENermline mutations are responsible for the development of Cow-en disease, Bannayan-Zonana syndrome [7,8] and Lhermitteuclos disease, in which disorganized hamartomas appear inarious organs [9].  Besides functioning as a tumor suppres-or, PTEN is also essential for embryonic development [10,11].TEN encodes a protein that has sequence homology withhosphatases which dephosphorylate both tyrosine and ser-ne/threonine phosphates on proteins [12\u201314].  PTEN is also capablef dephosphorylating inositol phospholipids [15]. In particular,TEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphatePIP3) and phosphatidylinositol-4.5-biphosphate (PIP2). Formationf these lipids is catalyzed by phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)pon stimulation with growth factors [16]. PIP2 and PIP3 are both\u2217 Corresponding author.

One importantdownstream target of PI3K is the AKT serine/threonine kinase [19].AKT is recruited to the plasma membrane by PIP3, and then phos-phorylated at Thr308 by protein dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Forfull activation, AKT needs to be subsequently phosphorylated atSer473 by PDK2. Activated AKT leaves the membrane and phos-phorylates its downstream targets such as Bad [20], IKKalphaand mTOR [20,21]. AKT activation induces expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, activation of NFkB, inhibition of Forkhead familyof transcription factors, and inactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad[22\u201325]. AKT-mediated modifications of above target genes ulti-mately result in cellular transformation, survival, proliferation andinvasion of a variety of cancers [26\u201329].Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world[30], and approximately 90% of patients with lung cancer ultimatelydie from metastatic disease [31]. Metastasis is the end result of acomplex series of steps involving multiple tumor-host interactions[32]. One important step in this process is invasion of cancer cells.PTEN is inactivated in a subset of and Akt is activated frequently inlung cancer. However, it is unknown whether PTEN plays any rolein lung cancer cell invasion and whether such an effect is mediatedthrough the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway. To address this question, wefirst screened several lung cancer cell lines for the status of PTENand AKT. We  then constructed a PTEN inducible system using thedx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.01.012http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002http://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcanmailto:hakanakca@yahoo.commailto:hakca@pau.edudx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.01.012ancerPApt22(sw2tgat(ArT3cvw(pwpsceapt2Tdgwgmbfhoac(2p9(bkH.

Construction of PTEN expression vectors and transfectionPTEN cDNA was cloned as described by Myers et al. [33]. Briefly,otal RNA was extracted from A549 cells using Trizol (Life Technolo-ies), and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)nd Superscript RNaseH2 RT, according to the manufacturer\u2019s pro-ocol (Life Technologies).

The PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E mutantsere generated by site-directed mutagenesis. By using FUGENRoche), PC14 cells were first stably transfected with a regulatorylasmid pcDNA6/TK, and clones resistant to blasticidin (10 \ufffdg/ml)ere then stably transfected with the pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT,cDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R, and pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E expres-ion vectors. Double transfectants were selected in the mediumontaining blasticidin (10 \ufffdg/ml) and zeocin (50 \ufffdg/ml). PTENxpression was induced by addition of tetracycline (2 \ufffdg/ml)nd was verified by Western blot analysis. pcDNA-PTEN-WT,cDNA-PTEN-G129R and pcDNA-PTEN-G129E vectors used forransient transfection studies..3. Western blot analysisCell lysates were prepared in ice-cold RIPA buffer (10 mMris\u2013HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1% sodiumeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Cellular debris was removed by centrifu-ation at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min  at 4 \u25e6C. One hundred \ufffdg of proteinsere subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE using 2\u201315% or 7.5% polyacrylamideels (PIERCE), proteins were immunoblotted onto Hybond-PVDFembrane (Amersham-PharmaciaBiotech), and labeled with anti-odies. AKT and phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibodies were obtainedrom Cell Signaling Technology.

Following transfection, cells were treated withtetracyclin (2 \ufffdg/ml) and cultured for an additional 24 h. Luciferaseactivities were then measured using a luciferase Assay System Kit(Promega).2.6. Soft agar colony assayAnchorage independent growth was determined by a soft agarcolony assay as described [34]. Briefly, 5 \u00d7 104 cells were preparedin 3 ml  of medium containing 0.4% noble agar (Difco), and layeredonto 5 ml  of bottom layer containing 0.5% noble agar (Difco). Two\ufffdg/ml tetracycline was added to both layers. Plates were incubatedfor 2\u20133 weeks, developed colonies were fixed and stained withHBSS containing 1.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.06% methylene blue,and visible colonies were counted.2.7. Cell invasion assayCell invasion assays were carried out using a trans-well matrigelinvasion chamber (Becton Dickinson Labware). The chamberswere hydrated with 1% BSA in RPMI-1640 for 1 h at roomtemperature, then placed into 24-well tissue culture plates con-taining 750 \ufffdl of RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS. For invasion study,we transiently transfected PC9 and PC3 cells with pcDNA-PTEN-WT, pcDNA-PTEN-G129R, pcDNA-PTEN-G129E and stablytrasnfected PC14 cells with pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E expression vectors. Allcells were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS, and 1 \u00d7 104 cells wereadded to each trans-well chamber and allowed to migrate to thebottom chamber for 24 h. Two \ufffdg/ml tetracycline was added toboth chambers, After 24 h, cells on the upper surface of the fil-ter were then removed by wiping with a cotton swab, and thenumber of migrated cells was  determined. The extent of migrationwas  expressed by normalizing the number of PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E expressing cells by that of empty vectortransfected cells. Ten individual wells were counted for everyexperiment. Error bars representing S.E. and Ps were calculated byrepeated measurements of ANOVA (Graphpad Software), followedby a Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test.3. Results3.1. Effects of PTEN expression on the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway inlung cancer cellsWe first examined expression levels of PTEN in 9 lung cancercell lines and in an immortalized small airway epithelial cell line,hSAEC-T1 [35], by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). PTEN expressionwas  detected in H23, II-18, KTSQ-1 and PC13 cells, but the amountsof PTEN protein in these cell lines were slightly lower than thatin hSAEC-T1 cells. PTEN was  not detected in the remaining five celllines, PC14, PC9, PC3, PC10 and H1299, suggesting that PTEN is inac-tivated in these cell lines. It was  previously reported that both alleleof PTEN gene is deleted in PC10 and its promoter is methylated inPC14 and H1299 cells [5,36,37]. Consistent with these findings wedid not observe any PTEN expression in these cells. Since AKT isdownstream of the PTEN pathway and is often phosphorylated in304 H.

AKT was  detectedn all the cell lines examined. AKT at Ser473 was phosphorylated inve cell lines, PC14, PC9, PC3, PC10 and H1299, all of which showedhe absence of PTEN protein. Therefore, it was strongly indicatedhat PTEN inactivation results in the activation of AKT in these lungancer cell lines.To examine the effect of PTEN expression in lung cancer cells,etracycline-inducible PTEN vectors were constructed and trans-ected into PC14 cells, in which endogenous PTEN expression wasot detected by Western blot analysis. Vectors carrying wild-typeTEN (PTEN-WT) as well as catalytically (PTEN-G129R) and lipidhosphatase (PTEN-G129E) inactive PTEN mutants were preparedor this study as described in Materials and Methods. These vectorsere stably transfected into PC14 cells, transiently transfected inC9 and PC3 cells, and PTEN induction after tetracycline treatmentas confirmed by Western blot analysis. Representative results ofTEN induction are shown in Fig. 2A. Wild-type PTEN expressionas detected 4 h after tetracycline treatment, reached the maxi-um level at 24 h, and continued up to 120 h after the treatment.e  were also able to obtain PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E mutant-nducible cells. Induction of PTEN after 24 and 48 h of tetracyclinereatment in PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E transfectedells are shown in Fig. 2B.We next examined the effects of induced PTEN expressionn phosphorylation levels of AKT in PC14 cells (Fig. 2B). Themount of phosphorylated AKT was decreased at both 24 h and8 h after tetracycline treatment in PTEN-WT transfectants. In con-rast, such a decrease was not observed in mock, PTEN-G129R andTEN-G129E transfectants. Therefore, AKT phosphorylation wasonfirmed to be partly due to PTEN inactivation in PC14 cells.NFkB is a downstream target of the PI3K/AKT pathway; there-ore, we next examined the effects of PTEN expression on NFkBctivity by a reporter assay. Cells expressing PTEN-WT, PTEN-129R and PTEN-G129E were transiently transfected with anFkB luciferase reporter vector and a renilla luciferase vector asnternal control. Expression of wild type PTEN significantly inhib-cells.ited NFkB activity; however, expression of PTEN mutants didnot (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that PTEN can suppress theAKT/NFkB pathway through its lipid phosphatase activity in PC14cells.H. Akca et al. / Lung Cancer 73 (2011) 302\u2013 309 305Fig. 3.

The effects of AKT activation on NFkB activity and cellular invasiveness onNIH3T3 cells. We  used NIH3T3 and CA-AKT expressing NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells forthis  experiment (A). To determine the effect of AKT activity on NFkB activationthese cells were co-transfected with pGL3-NFkB-promoter-Luc (0.5 \ufffdg/well) and06 H. Akca et al. / Lung CTEN inhibited the growth of PC14 cells in soft agar, but nei-her PTEN-G129E nor PTEN-G129R had such an effect on PC14ells. Therefore, anchorage independent growth but not anchorageependent growth was suppressed by wild-type PTEN expressionn PC14 cells.To further explore whether PTEN inhibits cell invasion, we  nexterformed a cell invasion assay using PC14 transfectants. As shownn Fig. 3C, cell invasiveness was reduced by 72% in PC14 cellsxpressing wild-type PTEN compared to a mock transfectant. Suchnvasiveness was not suppressed in cells expressing PTEN-G129End PTEN-G129R, suggesting that inhibition of invasion was  depen-ent on lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. To confirm our resultsnd to discard cell specific findings PTEN-negative PC9 and PC3ells were transiently transfected with PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R andTEN-G129E. We  observed that ectopic expression of PTEN can sup-ress PC9 and PC3 cell invasion by inhibition of AKT/NFkB pathwayhrough its lipid phosphatase activity (Fig. 5)..3. Effects of PTEN expression on invasiveness of mouse NIH3T3ellsSince the AKT activity was robustly affected by PTEN activity inC14, PC9 and PC3 cells, we assumed that regulation of cell inva-iveness by PTEN might be dependent on AKT activity in cells. Toonfirm this assumption, NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells expressing consti-utively active AKT [38] were assessed by a cell invasion assay. AKTs constitutively phosphorylated in NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells but notn parental NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4A), and NFkB activation was showny a reporter assay (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we compared the invasive-ess of parental NIH3T3 cells and NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells by a cellnvasion assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells showed times higher invasiveness in comparison with parental NIH3T3ells. These results support our hypothesis that cell invasiveness isargely regulated by AKT and NFkB activities in all PC14, PC9, PC3nd NIH3T3 cells.. DiscussionLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death world-ide [39]. Metastases are the major cause of death from cancer;owever, molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis remainargely unclear. In normal lung tissues, high levels of PTEN expres-ion were detected in 100% [40], while, in lung cancer cell lines,TEN expression was lost in 44% and reduced in 29% [41]. Ouresults indicates that PTEN expression is lost in \u223c50% of NSCLC cells.his finding was in good agreement with previous findings, show-ng that high levels of PTEN expression were detected in normalung tissue [40], while PTEN expression was lost in 44% and reducedn 29% of lung cancer cell lines [41]. Moreover, PTEN deletion waseported to occur in 2% of NSCLC cells [5].  Therefore, it is likely thateletion is not a common mechanism of loss of PTEN expression.oro et al. [37] reported that the PTEN gene is not deleted but itsromoter region is hypermethylated in PC14 cells. Moreover, theylso reported that, following 5-aza-dC treatment, PTEN mRNA androtein was increased in PC14 cells. They also showed in the samerticle that the mechanism of loss of PTEN expression in PC9 cells isistone deacetylation [37]. Furthermore, Soria et al. [36] reportedhat PTEN promoter is hypermethylated in H1299 cells and PTENRNA was increased after 5-aza-dC treatment in this cell line. Itas reported that overexpression of phosphorylated AKT and lossf PTEN expression are associated with poor prognosis of patientsith NSCLC [40]. In our previously published study, levels of AKThosphorylation were enhanced by EGF treatment in PC3, PC9,C14 and H1299 cells without PTEN expression, but unchanged inI-18 and PC13 cells with PTEN expression [42].

Therefore, we  assumedhat PTEN inactivation and its effect on the PI3K/AKT/NFkB path-ay could be important in lung cancer cell invasion. To address ourypothesis, we first examined the expression status of PTEN pro-ectors by FUGEN HD transfection reagent. After 24 h cells were counted and 1 \u00d7 10ntaining 2 \ufffdg/ml tetracycline. Chemoattractant conditions were created by additiond counted (C). Error bars indicate S.D., *p < 0.05 comparing PTENwt transfected cellstein in 9 lung cancer cell lines. PTEN expression was lost in 5 andreduced in 4 of the 9 cell lines when compared with an immortal-ized small airway epithelial cell line. These results are consistentwith previous results [40]. We  also found increased AKT activitiesin cell lines with loss of PTEN expression. Therefore, AKT activ-3 ancerildmahntebOdeaiigtabnacWaPttice[tplcceceoAafmcaliTNpivtgsC[[[[[[[[[[[[[[08 H. Akca et al. / Lung Cty is well associated with the expression of PTEN in these 9 cellines.We then pursued the effect of PTEN expression on anchorageependent and independent growth of PC14 cells. We  first deter-ined the in vitro growth rates of mock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129Rnd PTEN-G129E expressing PC14 cells, and found that all cellsave similar proliferation rates, suggesting that PTEN activity doesot affect PC14 cell proliferation under standard culture condi-ions. Furnari et al. [43] reported that PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129Expression did not change the glioblastoma cell proliferation ratesut PTEN-WT expression inhibited proliferation by the 7th day.ur results are not consistent with their findings; however, weetermined the rate of proliferation only after 3 days. We  nextxamined the effects of wild-type and mutant PTEN expression onnchorage independent growth. Only wild-type PTEN expressionnhibited anchorage independent growth but neither catalyticallynactive nor lipid phosphatase dead PTEN had an effect to inhibit therowth. Previous studies also showed that PTEN expression inhibitshe anchorage independent growth of hepatoma [44], breast cancernd melanoma cell lines [45].PTEN expression has been also shown to suppress invasion ofreast cancer, glioma and colon cancer cells [46\u201348].  Therefore, weext attempted to elucidate whether PTEN inactivation is associ-ted with invasion of lung cancer cells. We  used PC14, PC9 and PC3ells, which lack endogenous PTEN expression, for this experiment.e stably transfected PC14 cells and transiently transfected PC9nd PC3 cells with mock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129E, and PTEN-G129R.TEN-WT inhibited the invasion of PC14, PC9 and PC3 cells respec-ively 72%, 48% and 46%, but mutants of PTEN did not, suggestinghat lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is essential for NSCLC cellnvasion. PTEN can suppress prostate cancer cell [49] and gliomaell [47] invasion, but the mechanism of this suppression is differ-nt between prostate cancer cells and glioma cells. Shukla et al.49] reported that PTEN can suppress prostate cancer cell invasionhrough the suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway by its lipid phos-hatase activity, however, Maier et al. [47] reported that the PTENipid phosphatase domain is not required for invasion of gliomaells. Our results clearly indicate that PTEN suppresses lung cancerell invasion through its lipid phosphatase activity. Recently, Zhangt al. [50] reported that microRNA-21 promotes invasion of lungancer cells by repressing expression of PTEN, however, they didn\u2019tlucidate the molecular mechanisms of PTEN-mediated inhibitionf lung cancer cell invasion. Since NFkB is a major target of activatedKT, we attempted to find interactions between the AKT/NFkBctivity and lung cancer cell invasion. Therefore, reporter vectorsor NFkB luciferase and renilla luciferase were co-transfected inock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E expressing PC14ells. The result indicated that only wild-type PTEN inhibits NFkBctivity, and implies that PTEN inhibits NFkB activity through itsipid phosphatase activity and PTEN can inhibit lung cancer cellnvasion through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway.o further confirm our hypothesis, we used parental NIH3T3 andIH3T3CA-AKT cells, in which constitutively active AKT is overex-ressed [38]. AKT activation induced NFkB activation and cellularnvasion in NIH3T3 cells, supporting that AKT-mediated NFkB acti-ation is necessary for lung cancer cell invasion.In summary, we report here for the first time that activation ofhe AKT/NFkB pathway is necessary for the anchorage independentrowth and invasion of lung cancer cells, and PTEN expression canuppress both processes by inhibiting the AKT/NFkB pathway.onflict of interest statementThe authors declare no conflict of interest for this article.[[ 73 (2011) 302\u2013 309AcknowledgmentsWe  would like to thank Prof. Dr. Osman N.
